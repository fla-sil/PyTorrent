Features are numerical\ndescriptors that aim to characterize and distinguish the different\nvariability classes.\nOur vision is to be capable of analyzing and comparing light-curves from all\nthe available astronomical catalogs in a standard and universal way. This\nwould facilitate and make more efficient tasks as modelling, classification,\ndata cleaning, outlier detection and data analysis in general.</p>\n\n        \n      \n      \n    </div>", "files": [{"type": "conda", "size": "73.7 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/feets-0.4-py_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/feets/0.4/download/noarch/feets-0.4-py_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 858, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}], "labels": [{"name": "", "label": "0.4"}, {"name": "", "label": "0.4"}], "badges": ["https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/feets/badges/version.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/feets/badges/latest_release_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/feets/badges/latest_release_relative_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/feets/badges/platforms.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/feets/badges/license.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/feets/badges/downloads.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/feets/badges/installer/conda.svg"]}}

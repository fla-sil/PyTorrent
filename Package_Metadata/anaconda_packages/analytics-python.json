Instead of writing code to integrate all of your tools individually, send data to Segment, once.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Install tracking for the last time</strong>. We're the last integration you'll ever need to write. You only need to instrument Segment once. Reduce all of your tracking code and advertising tags into a single set of API calls.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Send data from anywhere</strong>. Send Segment data from any device, and we'll transform and send it on to any tool.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Query your data in SQL</strong>. Slice, dice, and analyze your data in detail with Segment SQL. We'll transform and load your customer behavioral data directly from your apps into Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Postgres. Save weeks of engineering time by not having to invent your own data warehouse and ETL pipeline.</p>\n\n<p>For example, you can capture data on any app:\n<code>analytics.track('Order Completed', { price: 99.84 })</code>\n``<code>\nThen, query the resulting data in SQL:\n</code>select * from app.order_completed order by price desc`</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://segment.com/startups\">\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16131737/53128952-08d3d400-351b-11e9-9730-7da35adda781.png\">\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you are part of a new startup  (&lt;$5M raised, &lt;2 years since founding), we just launched a new startup program\nfor you.

Cell size is larger than the channel\nbelt width, and natural levees, which maintain a bankfull elevation\nabove the channel bed, exist within a river cell. The river course is\ndetermined using a steepest-descent methodology, and erosion and deposition\nalong the river profile are modeled as a linear diffusive process. An\navulsion occurs when the riverbed becomes super-elevated relative to\nthe surrounding floodplain, but only if the new steepest-descent path\nto sea level is shorter than the prior river course. If the new path to\nsea level is not shorter, then a crevasse splay is deposited in the\nadjacent river cells. The model has been designed to couple with the\nCoastline Evolution Model through the CSDMS Basic Model Interface.</p>\n\n        \n      \n      \n    </div>", "files": [{"type": "conda", "size": "27.1 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/rafem-0.4.3-py_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rafem/0.4.3/download/noarch/rafem-0.4.3-py_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 109, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}, {"type": "conda", "size": "23.7 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/rafem-0.4.2-py_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rafem/0.4.2/download/noarch/rafem-0.4.2-py_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 1124, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}], "labels": [{"name": "", "label": "0.4.3"}, {"name": "", "label": "0.4.3"}], "badges": ["https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rafem/badges/version.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rafem/badges/latest_release_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rafem/badges/latest_release_relative_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rafem/badges/platforms.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rafem/badges/license.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rafem/badges/downloads.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rafem/badges/installer/conda.svg"]}}

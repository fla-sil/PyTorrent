The code is written as a Python library and allows\nfor a complete 6 degrees of freedom simulation of a rocket's flight\ntrajectory, including high fidelity variable mass effects as well as\ndescent under parachutes. Weather conditions, such as wind profile,\ncan be imported from sophisticated datasets, allowing for realistic\nscenarios. Furthermore, the implementation facilitates complex simulations,\nsuch as multi-stage rockets, design and trajectory optimization and\ndispersion analysis.</p>\n\n        \n      \n      \n    </div>", "files": [{"type": "conda", "size": "64.0 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/rocketpy-0.9.4-py_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rocketpy/0.9.4/download/noarch/rocketpy-0.9.4-py_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 88, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}]}, {"type": "conda", "size": "63.7 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/rocketpy-0.9.2-py_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rocketpy/0.9.2/download/noarch/rocketpy-0.9.2-py_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 98, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}]}], "labels": [{"name": "", "label": "0.9.4"}], "badges": ["https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rocketpy/badges/version.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rocketpy/badges/latest_release_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rocketpy/badges/latest_release_relative_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rocketpy/badges/platforms.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rocketpy/badges/license.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rocketpy/badges/downloads.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/rocketpy/badges/installer/conda.svg"]}}

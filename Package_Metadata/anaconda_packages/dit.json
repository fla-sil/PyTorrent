Information\ntheory was originally developed to quantify how quickly and reliably information could be transmitted across\nan arbitrary channel. The demands of modern, data-driven science have been coopting and extending these\nquantities and methods into unknown, multivariate settings where the interpretation and best practices\nare not known. For example, there are at least four reasonable multivariate generalizations of the mutual\ninformation, none of which inherit all the interpretations of the standard bivariate case. Which is best\nto use is context-dependent. dit implements a vast range of multivariate information measures in an effort to allow\ninformation practitioners to study how these various measures behave and interact in a variety of contexts.\nWe hope that having all these measures and techniques implemented in one place will allow the development of\nrobust techniques for the automated quantification of dependencies within a system and concrete interpretation\nof what those dependencies mean.</p>\n\n        \n      \n      \n    </div>", "files": [{"type": "conda", "size": "240.4 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/dit-1.2.3-py_1.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dit/1.2.3/download/noarch/dit-1.2.3-py_1.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 1045, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}, {"type": "conda", "size": "240.2 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/dit-1.2.3-py_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dit/1.2.3/download/noarch/dit-1.2.3-py_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 1020, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}], "labels": [{"name": "", "label": "1.2.3"}, {"name": "", "label": "1.2.3"}], "badges": ["https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dit/badges/version.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dit/badges/latest_release_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dit/badges/latest_release_relative_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dit/badges/platforms.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dit/badges/license.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dit/badges/downloads.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dit/badges/installer/conda.svg"]}}

The database is a simple data file containing\nrecords, each is a pair of  a key and a value. Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length. Both binary\ndata and character string can be used as a key and a value. Each key must be unique within a database. There is\nneither concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.</p>\n\n<p>Kyoto Cabinet runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store one million records is 0.9 seconds for hash\ndatabase, and 1.1 seconds for B+ tree database. Moreover, the size of database is very small. For example,\noverhead for a record is 16 bytes for hash database, and 4 bytes for B+ tree database. Furthermore, scalability of\nKyoto Cabinet is great. The database size can be up to 8EB (9.22e18 bytes).</p>\n\n<p>Kyoto Cabinet is written in the C++ language, and provided as API of C++, C, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, and\nLua. Kyoto Cabinet is available on platforms which have API conforming to C++03 with the TR1 library\nextensions. Kyoto Cabinet is a free software licensed under the GNU General Public License. On the other hand, a\ncommercial license is also provided. If you use Kyoto Cabinet within a proprietary software, the commercial\nlicense is required.</p>\n</div>\n        \n      \n      \n    </div>", "files": [{"type": "conda", "size": "2.9 MB", "file": {"name": "linux-64/kyotocabinet-1.2.76-hd28b015_1.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kyotocabinet/1.2.76/download/linux-64/kyotocabinet-1.2.76-hd28b015_1.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 2235, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}, {"name": "cf201901", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf201901"}]}, {"type": "conda", "size": "2.9 MB", "file": {"name": "linux-64/kyotocabinet-1.2.76-hd28b015_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kyotocabinet/1.2.76/download/linux-64/kyotocabinet-1.2.76-hd28b015_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 1895, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}, {"name": "cf201901", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf201901"}]}], "labels": [{"name": "", "label": "1.2.76"}, {"name": "", "label": "1.2.76"}, {"name": "", "label": "1.2.76"}], "badges": ["https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kyotocabinet/badges/version.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kyotocabinet/badges/latest_release_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kyotocabinet/badges/latest_release_relative_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kyotocabinet/badges/platforms.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kyotocabinet/badges/license.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kyotocabinet/badges/downloads.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kyotocabinet/badges/installer/conda.svg"]}}

This library aims at a reasonably complete mock of\nMongoDB for testing purposes, not a perfect replica. This means some\nfeatures are not likely to make it in any time soon.</p>\n\n<p>Also, since many corner cases are encountered along the way, our goal is to\ntry and TDD our way into completeness. This means that every time we\nencounter a missing or broken (incompatible) feature, we write a test for\nit and fix it. There are probably lots of such issues hiding around\nlurking, so feel free to open issues and/or pull requests and help the\nproject out!</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: We don't include pymongo functionality as \"stubs\" or \"placeholders\".\nSince this library is used to validate production code, it is unacceptable\nto behave differently than the real pymongo implementation. In such cases\nit is better to throw NotImplementedError than implement a modified version\nof the original behavior.</p>\n</div>\n        \n      \n      \n    </div>", "files": [{"type": "conda", "size": "40.3 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/mongomock-3.18.0-py_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mongomock/3.18.0/download/noarch/mongomock-3.18.0-py_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 1229, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}, {"type": "conda", "size": "39.2 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/mongomock-3.17.0-py_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mongomock/3.17.0/download/noarch/mongomock-3.17.0-py_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 3220, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}], "labels": [{"name": "", "label": "3.18.0"}, {"name": "", "label": "3.18.0"}], "badges": ["https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mongomock/badges/version.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mongomock/badges/latest_release_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mongomock/badges/latest_release_relative_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mongomock/badges/platforms.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mongomock/badges/license.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mongomock/badges/downloads.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mongomock/badges/installer/conda.svg"]}}

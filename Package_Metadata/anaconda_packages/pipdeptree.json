It works for packages\ninstalled globally on a machine as well as in a virtualenv. Since pip freeze\nshows all dependencies as a flat list, finding out which are the top level\npackages and which packages do they depend on requires some effort. It can also\nbe tedious to resolve conflicting dependencies because pip doesn't yet have\ntrue dependency resolution (more on this later). This utility tries to solve\nthis problem.</p>\n\n        \n      \n      \n    </div>", "files": [{"type": "conda", "size": "14.3 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/pipdeptree-0.13.2-py_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pipdeptree/0.13.2/download/noarch/pipdeptree-0.13.2-py_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 1571, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}], "labels": [{"name": "", "label": "0.13.2"}, {"name": "", "label": "0.13.2"}], "badges": ["https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pipdeptree/badges/version.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pipdeptree/badges/latest_release_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pipdeptree/badges/latest_release_relative_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pipdeptree/badges/platforms.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pipdeptree/badges/license.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pipdeptree/badges/downloads.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pipdeptree/badges/installer/conda.svg"]}}

{"title": "r-breakaway", "access": "public", "summary": "Species richness estimation is an important problem in biodiversity analysis. This package provides methods for total species richness estimation (observed plus unobserved) and a method for modelling total diversity with covariates. breakaway() estimates total (observed plus unobserved) species richness. Microbial diversity datasets are characterized by a large number of rare species and a small number of highly abundant species. The class of models implemented by breakaway() is flexible enough to model both these features. breakaway_nof1() implements a similar procedure however does not require a singleton count. betta() provides a method for modelling total diversity with covariates in a way that accounts for its estimated nature and thus accounts for unobserved taxa, and betta_random() permits random effects modelling.", "updated": "2019-08-19", "detail": {"meta": {"license": "GPL-2", "license_url": "http://opensource.org/search/node/GPL-2", "home": "https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=breakaway", "home_url": "https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=breakaway", "documentation": null, "documentation_url": null, "development": null, "development_url": null, "download_count": 1799, "last_upload": "Last upload: 8 months and 8 days ago"}, "installers": ["conda install -c conda-forge r-breakaway", "conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf202003 r-breakaway"], "note": " This package contains files in non-standard\n           labels", "platform_versions": [["\n  ", "v3.0"]], "description": "<div class=\"panel\">\n      <h3>Description</h3>\n      \n        \n        \n        \n      \n      \n    </div>", "files": [{"type": "conda", "size": "150.5 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/r-breakaway-3.0-r36h6115d3f_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-breakaway/3.0/download/noarch/r-breakaway-3.0-r36h6115d3f_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 898, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}, {"type": "conda", "size": "148.3 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/r-breakaway-3.0-r35h6115d3f_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-breakaway/3.0/download/noarch/r-breakaway-3.0-r35h6115d3f_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 901, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}], "labels": [{"name": "", "label": "3.0"}, {"name": "", "label": "3.0"}], "badges": ["https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-breakaway/badges/version.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-breakaway/badges/latest_release_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-breakaway/badges/latest_release_relative_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-breakaway/badges/platforms.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-breakaway/badges/license.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-breakaway/badges/downloads.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-breakaway/badges/installer/conda.svg"]}}

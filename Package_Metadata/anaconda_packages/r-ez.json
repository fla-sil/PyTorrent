{"title": "r-ez", "access": "public", "summary": "Facilitates easy analysis of factorial experiments, including purely within-Ss designs (a.k.a. \"repeated measures\"), purely between-Ss designs, and mixed within-and-between-Ss designs. The functions in this package aim to provide simple, intuitive and consistent specification of data analysis and visualization. Visualization functions also include design visualization for pre-analysis data auditing, and correlation matrix visualization. Finally, this package includes functions for non-parametric analysis, including permutation tests and bootstrap resampling. The bootstrap function obtains predictions either by cell means or by more advanced/powerful mixed effects models, yielding predictions and confidence intervals that may be easily visualized at any level of the experiment's design.", "updated": "2019-08-14", "detail": {"meta": {"license": "GPL (>= 2)", "license_url": "http://opensource.org/search/node/GPL+%28%3E%3D+2%29", "home": "http://github.com/mike-lawrence/ez", "home_url": "http://github.com/mike-lawrence/ez", "documentation": null, "documentation_url": null, "development": null, "development_url": null, "download_count": 1903, "last_upload": "Last upload: 8 months and 13 days ago"}, "installers": ["conda install -c conda-forge r-ez", "conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf202003 r-ez"], "note": " This package contains files in non-standard\n           labels", "platform_versions": [["\n  ", "v4.4_0"]], "description": "<div class=\"panel\">\n      <h3>Description</h3>\n      \n        \n        \n        \n      \n      \n    </div>", "files": [{"type": "conda", "size": "343.8 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/r-ez-4.4_0-r35h6115d3f_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-ez/4.4_0/download/noarch/r-ez-4.4_0-r35h6115d3f_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 968, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}, {"type": "conda", "size": "345.3 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/r-ez-4.4_0-r36h6115d3f_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-ez/4.4_0/download/noarch/r-ez-4.4_0-r36h6115d3f_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 935, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}], "labels": [{"name": "", "label": "4.4_0"}, {"name": "", "label": "4.4_0"}], "badges": ["https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-ez/badges/version.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-ez/badges/latest_release_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-ez/badges/latest_release_relative_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-ez/badges/platforms.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-ez/badges/license.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-ez/badges/downloads.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-ez/badges/installer/conda.svg"]}}

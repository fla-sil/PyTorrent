This toolbox provides a Python\nbased scripting interface, including file I/O, mesh visualisation and\npost-processing facilities. The underlying JIGSAW library is a collection\nof unstructured triangle- and tetrahedron-based meshing algorithms,\ndesigned to produce high quality Delaunay-based grids for computational\nsimulation. JIGSAW includes both Delaunay-refinement based algorithms for\nthe construction of new meshes, as well as optimisation driven methods for\nthe improvement of existing grids.</p>\n\n        \n      \n      \n    </div>", "files": [{"type": "conda", "size": "604.9 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/jigsawpy-0.2.1-py_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jigsawpy/0.2.1/download/noarch/jigsawpy-0.2.1-py_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 168, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}], "labels": [{"name": "", "label": "0.2.1"}, {"name": "", "label": "0.2.1"}], "badges": ["https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jigsawpy/badges/version.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jigsawpy/badges/latest_release_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jigsawpy/badges/latest_release_relative_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jigsawpy/badges/platforms.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jigsawpy/badges/license.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jigsawpy/badges/downloads.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jigsawpy/badges/installer/conda.svg"]}}

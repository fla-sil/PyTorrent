It provides a handful of directives, patterned after the\nPython-centric autodoc ones, for pulling JSDoc-formatted documentation into\nreStructuredText pages. And, because you can keep using JSDoc in your code,\nyou remain compatible with the rest of your JS tooling, like Google's\nClosure Compiler.</p>\n</div>\n        \n      \n      \n    </div>", "files": [{"type": "conda", "size": "37.6 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/sphinx-js-2.8-py_0.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sphinx-js/2.8/download/noarch/sphinx-js-2.8-py_0.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 548, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}], "labels": [{"name": "", "label": "2.8"}, {"name": "", "label": "2.8"}], "badges": ["https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sphinx-js/badges/version.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sphinx-js/badges/latest_release_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sphinx-js/badges/latest_release_relative_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sphinx-js/badges/platforms.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sphinx-js/badges/license.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sphinx-js/badges/downloads.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sphinx-js/badges/installer/conda.svg"]}}

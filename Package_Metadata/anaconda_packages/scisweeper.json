After the calculations are\nfinished the results are summarized in a pandas.DataFrame, which makes\nthem easily accessible for machine learning tools like tensorflow or\npytorch. Coming from a scientific environment scisweeper was develop\nwith a focus on debugging. Broken jobs can be identified, executed again\nmanually or deleted and in case you need to update the collect_output\nfunction there is no need to execute the calculations again, the output\ncan be parsed separatly to update the results in the pandas.DataFrame.</p>\n\n        \n      \n      \n    </div>", "files": [{"type": "conda", "size": "10.3 kB", "file": {"name": "noarch/scisweeper-0.0.2-py_1.tar.bz2", "href": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scisweeper/0.0.2/download/noarch/scisweeper-0.0.2-py_1.tar.bz2"}, "uploaded": null, "uploader": "conda-forge", "downloads": 841, "labels": [{"name": "main", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=main"}, {"name": "cf202003", "label": "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo/files?type=any&label=cf202003"}]}], "labels": [{"name": "", "label": "0.0.2"}, {"name": "", "label": "0.0.2"}], "badges": ["https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scisweeper/badges/version.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scisweeper/badges/latest_release_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scisweeper/badges/latest_release_relative_date.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scisweeper/badges/platforms.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scisweeper/badges/license.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scisweeper/badges/downloads.svg", "https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scisweeper/badges/installer/conda.svg"]}}

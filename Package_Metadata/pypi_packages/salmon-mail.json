Salmon is designed to sit\nbehind a traditional mail server in the same way a web application sits behind\nApache or Nginx. It has all the features of a web application stack (templates,\nrouting, handlers, state machine) and plays well with other libraries, such as\nDjango and SQLAlchemy.\n\nSalmon has been released uner the GNU GPLv3, as published by the FSF.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\nSalmon supports running in many contexts for processing mail using the best\ntechnology currently available. Since Salmon is aiming to be a modern mail\nserver and Mail processing framework, it has some features you don't find in\nany other Mail server.\n\n- Written in portable Python that should run on almost any Unix server.\n- Handles mail in almost any encoding and format, including attachments, and\n  canonicalizes them for easier processing.\n- Sends nearly pristine clean mail that is easier to process by other\n  receiving servers.\n- Properly decodes internationalized mail into Python unicode, and translates\n  Python unicode back into nice clean ascii and/or UTF-8 mail.\n- Supports working with Maildir queues to defer work and distribute it to\n  multiple machines.\n- Can run as an non-root user on privileged ports to reduce the risk of\n  intrusion.\n- Salmon can also run in a completely separate virtualenv for easy deployment.\n- A flexible and easy to use routing system lets you write stateful or state\\\n  *less* handlers of your email.\n- Ability to use Jinja2 or Mako templates to craft emails including the\n  headers.\n- Easily configurable to use alternative sending and receiving systems,\n  database libraries, or any other systems you need to talk to.\n- Yet, you don't *have* to configure everything to get stated. A simple\n  ``salmon gen`` command lets you get an application up and running quick.\n- Finally, many helpful commands for general mail server debugging and\n  cleaning.\n\nInstalling\n==========\n\n``pip install salmon-mail``\n\nProject Information\n===================\n\nProject documentation can be found\n`here <http://salmon-mail.readthedocs.org/>`__\n\nFork\n----\n\nSalmon is a fork of Lamson. In the summer of 2012 (2012-07-13 to be exact),\nLamson was relicensed under a BSD variant that was revokable.  The two clauses\nthat were of most concern::\n\n    4. Contributors agree that any contributions are owned by the copyright holder\n    and that contributors have absolutely no rights to their contributions.\n\n    5. The copyright holder reserves the right to revoke this license on anyone who\n    uses this copyrighted work at any time for any reason.\n\nI read that to mean that I could make a contribution but then have said work\ndenied to me because the orginal author didn't like the colour of my socks. So\nI went and found the latest version that was available under the GNU GPL\nversion 3.\n\nSalmon is an anagram of Lamson, if you hadn't worked it out already.\n\nSource\n------\n\nYou can find the source on GitHub:\n\nhttps://github.com/moggers87/salmon\n\nStatus\n------\n\nSalmon has just had some major changes to modernise the code-base. The main\nAPIs should be compatible with releases prior to 3.0.0, but there's no\nguarantee that older applications won't need changes.\n\nPython versions supported are: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.\n\nSee the CHANGELOG for more details on what's changed since version 2.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSalmon is released under the GNU GPLv3 license, which can be found `here\n<https://github.com/moggers87/salmon/blob/master/LICENSE>`__\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPull requests and issues are most welcome. Please read our `code of conduct\n<https://github.com/moggers87/salmon/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__ before\ncontributing!\n\nI will not accept code that has been submitted for inclusion in the original\nproject due to the terms of its new licence.\n\nCode Of Conduct\n---------------\n\nThe Salmon project has adopted the Contributor Covenant Code version 1.4. By\ncontributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.\n\nThe full text of the code of conduct can be found `here\n<https://github.com/moggers87/salmon/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nThe Salmon project needs unit tests, code reviews, coverage information, source\nanalysis, and security reviews to maintain quality. If you find a bug, please\ntake the time to write a test case that fails or provide a piece of mail that\ncauses the failure.\n\nIf you contribute new code then your code should have as much coverage as\npossible, with a minimal amount of mocking.\n\nTests can be run via::\n\n    $ python setup.py test\n\nAlternatively, if you have multiple versions of Python installed locally::\n\n    $ pip install tox\n    $ tox -e py27,py36\n\nRefer to the `tox documentation <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ for\nmore information.\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nSalmon is written entirely in Python and runs on Python 2.7 with experimental\nsupport for Python 3. It should hopefully run on any platform that supports\nPython and has Unix semantics.\n\nIf you find yourself lost in source code, just yell.\n\nPEP-8 should be followed where possible, but feel free to ignore the 80\ncharacter limit it imposes (120 is a good marker IMO).\n\n.. inclusion-marker-do-not-remove-end\n\nFunding\n=======\n\nIf you have found Salmon to be useful and would like to see its continued\ndevelopment, please consider `buying me a coffee\n<https://ko-fi.com/moggers87>`__.\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/moggers87/salmon.svg?branch=master\n   :alt: Build Status\n   :scale: 100%\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/moggers87/salmon\n.. |Coverage| image:: https://codecov.io/github/moggers87/salmon/coverage.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://codecov.io/github/moggers87/salmon\n   :alt: Coverage Status\n   :scale: 100%\n.. |docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/salmon-mail/badge/?version=latest\n   :alt: Documentation Status\n   :scale: 100%\n   :target: https://salmon-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/salmon-mail", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/moggers87/salmon", "keywords": "", "license": "GPLv3", "maintainer": "Matt Molyneaux", "maintainer_email": "moggers87+git@moggers87.co.uk", "name": "salmon-mail", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/salmon-mail/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/salmon-mail/", "project_urls": {"Download": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/salmon-mail", "Homepage": "https://github.com/moggers87/salmon"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/salmon-mail/3.2.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "A Python mail server forked from Lamson", "version": "3.2.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p><a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/moggers87/salmon\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Build Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/672ea2d418bd98ce9653c057d5f9b2bc098806ab/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f6d6f676765727338372f73616c6d6f6e2e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a> <a href=\"https://codecov.io/github/moggers87/salmon\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Coverage Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/d150c597a014fb070a5619f82e4970c8c5d6a5e6/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f762e696f2f6769746875622f6d6f676765727338372f73616c6d6f6e2f636f7665726167652e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a> <a href=\"https://salmon-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Documentation Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/a8572527c9937ebd093a5178dce342825dde2694/68747470733a2f2f72656164746865646f63732e6f72672f70726f6a656374732f73616c6d6f6e2d6d61696c2f62616467652f3f76657273696f6e3d6c6174657374\"></a></p>\n<div id=\"salmon-a-python-mail-server\">\n<h2>Salmon - A Python Mail Server</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Download: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/salmon-mail/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pypi.org/project/salmon-mail/</a></li>\n<li>Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/moggers87/salmon\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/moggers87/salmon</a></li>\n<li>Docs: <a href=\"https://salmon-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://salmon-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Salmon is a pure Python mail server designed to create robust and complex mail\napplications in the style of modern web frameworks.

While towncrier is focused on\nPython and `.rst` formatting, Proclamation is explicitly language-neutral (a\nmotivating use case was a mixed-content repo with specifications as well as C++\ncode) and markup-neutral (all formatting is done by a Jinja2 template: the\ndefault is markdown but you can complete change the formatting if you supply a\ncustom template.)\n\n## Install\n\n**Note:** Contributors to your Proclamation-using project do not need to install\nProclamation -- all they have to do is create a text file, and only the person\ndoing releases strictly needs to install Proclamation. However, there are some\nutilities that they might find useful if they do.\n\nProclamation is available on [pypi][], so you can install it for your local user with:\n\n```sh\npip3 install --user proclamation\n```\n\nUpdating to a new release would be done with\n\n```sh\npip3 install --user --upgrade proclamation\n```\n\nAlternately, you can install from this repository. If you do this, it's\nrecommended to install this in a virtualenv. Something like this will work on\n*nix-like systems, adjusted for your shell usage.\n\n```bash\n# Create a virtualenv in `venv`\npython3 -m venv venv\n\n# Activate it\n. venv/bin/activate\n\n# Install a link to this package in the venv.\npip install --editable .\n```\n\nIf you follow those instructions, the virtualenv will refer to the source\ninstead of copying the source, so updating your local clone of this repo will\nalso update the virtualenv. Omit the `--editable` if you want other behavior.\n\nNote that the `venv/bin/proclamation` script can be run from outside the venv,\nthrough the magic of setuptools, so if you want to be able to use it elsewhere\non your system, you might symlink it into a directory that's in your `PATH`.\n\n[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/proclamation/\n\n## Usage\n\nFor detailed instructions that you might consider copying and modifying for your\nown project, see [USAGE.md](usage.md).\n\nProclamation itself is primarily used through the command line by the person\nmaking releases.\n\nIf the `proclamation` command line tool doesn't quite suit your complex needs,\nyou can access the bulk of the functionality through using this as a Python\nmodule. See the command line interface driver, `proclamation/main.py`, to see\nhow it interacts with the underlying capabilities.\n\n### CLI\n\nProclamation has command-line help available by passing `--help`. You can access\ngeneral help, listing overall options and subcommands, as follows:\n\n```sh\nproclamation --help\n```\n\nAdditionally, each subcommand has its own help text, describing it and its available options, for example: \n\n```sh\nproclamation build --help\n```\n\nA brief description of the two most common subcommands follows.\n\nTo see a preview of the changelog additions that would be made if you\nreleased a new version right now, run\n\n```sh\nproclamation draft\n```\n\nThe `draft` subcommand is the most useful one to non-maintaining contributors\nwho choose to install Proclamation, as it lets them verify their changelog\nfragment(s) appear as desired.\n\nThe main subcommand used by maintainers is `build`, for example like this:\n\n```sh\nproclamation build YOUR_VERSION_NUMBER_HERE --delete-fragments --overwrite\n```\n\nThis command updates your changelog file(s) (overwriting the original), and\nremoves your used changelog fragments for you. (You still need to remove them\nfrom your version control system.)\n\n## Maintainers\n\n[@ryanpavlik](https://gitlab.com/ryanpavlik)\n\n## Thanks\n\nThis tool was initially developed by Ryan Pavlik in the course of his work at\nthe open-source software consultancy [Collabora](https://collabora.com). Thanks\nto Collabora and their \"Open First\" mantra for supporting the development of\nthis software.\n\nA debt of gratitude is owed to the developers of the [towncrier][] package,\nwhich strongly inspired the usage pattern for this tool. (Before writing this\ntool, Ryan initially attempted to modify towncrier to suit the use cases he\nhad.) It's definitely a project worth looking into if you maintain a Python\nproject. (The Proclamation project doesn't use it, despite being in Python,\nbecause it uses itself...) Ryan first learned about towncrier at\n[Stephen Finucane's talk at FOSDEM 2020](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/python2020_manage_change/).\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By\nparticipating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you have questions or found a bug, feel free to file an issue on the GitLab\nproject for Proclamation.\n\nMerge requests are gratefully accepted. To develop on Proclamation, you'll\nprobably want to follow the virtualenv installation instructions above to\nlocally install a link in a virtualenv.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following suggestions/requirements:\n\n- Run `pytest-3` or similar to run the automated tests.\n- Run `autopep8 proclamation/*.py proclamation/test/*.py --in-place` to\n  automatically format the source code with [autopep8][].\n- Use [`tox`][tox] to run [flake8][] as well as tests for multiple Python versions.\n  - e.g. on Debian Buster, you can run `tox -e py37,flake8` (adding `py35` if\n    you upgraded from Stretch and never removed python 3.5)\n- When submitting a change, be sure to create your changelog fragment in the\n  changes directory! :)\n- If editing the README, please conform to the\n  [standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)\n  specification.\n\nNo copyright assignment is required to contribute. However, you are required to\nmake your contributions available under the prevailing license for that content\ntype (see below) for it to be accepted into the main repo.\n\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[flake8]: https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/\n[autopep8]: https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8.\n\n## License\n\nThe *tl;dr* is: The bulk of the package is [Apache-2.0][] licensed.

There are a couple of guidelines \r\naround submitting changes:\r\n\r\n* Changes will only be accepted via pull requests on github.\r\n* Any code changes should have some unit tests, if it's a fix for a bug it won't be accepted unless it has tests.\r\n* Again with any code changes if your pull request `breaks the build <https://travis-ci.org/mlowen/Glint/pull_requests>`_ it won't be accepted.\r\n\r\nRunning the tests\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nWhile Glint doesn't have any dependencies outside of the python core library you will need to install `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ to \r\nrun the tests. Once that is installed you have two options for running the test you can run either: ::\r\n\r\n\tnostests\r\n \r\nor ::\r\n\r\n\tpython ./setup.py test\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n==========\r\n\r\nv0.2.0\r\n------\r\n\r\n* Updated the argument parsing to allow optional arguments in the format of <prefix><name>=<value>\r\n* Updated the argument parsing to replace - characters with _ when parsing positional arguments and flags.\r\n\r\nv0.1.0\r\n------\r\n\r\n* Running a method based on the first argument supplied.\r\n* Running a 'default' method when no arguments are supplied.\r\n* Parsing of positional arguments based on method signature.\r\n* Parsing of optional arguments based on method signature.\r\n* Parsing of flags based on method signature.\r\n* Printing of dynamically generated help screen based on the commands that had been set up.\r\n* Printing of dynamically generated help screen for a particular command based on the method signature supplied to that command.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nGlint is available under the MIT license which is as follows:\r\n\r\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Michael Lowen\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

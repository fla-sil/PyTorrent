Discussion should happen on the `virtualenv email group\r\n<http://groups.google.com/group/python-virtualenv?hl=en>`_.\r\n\r\nDifferences From easy_install\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\npyinstall cannot install some packages.  Specifically:\r\n\r\n* It cannot install from eggs.  It only installs from source.  (Maybe this will\r\n  be changed sometime, but it's low priority.)\r\n\r\n* It doesn't understand Setuptools extras (like ``package[test]``).  This should\r\n  be added eventually.\r\n\r\n* It is incompatible with some packages that customize distutils or setuptools\r\n  in their ``setup.py`` files.\r\n\r\n* Maybe it doesn't work on Windows.  At least, the author doesn't test on\r\n  Windows often.\r\n\r\n* It also has some extra features.  Extra features the author thinks are great.\r\n\r\n.. _`requirements file`:\r\n\r\nRequirements Files\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nWhen installing software, and Python packages in particular, it's common that\r\nyou get a lot of libraries installed.  You just did ``easy_install MyPackage``\r\nand you get a dozen packages.  Each of these packages has its own version.\r\n\r\nMaybe you ran that installation and it works.  Great!  Will it keep working? \r\nDid you have to provide special options to get it to find everything?  Did you\r\nhave to install a bunch of other optional pieces?  Most of all, will you be able\r\nto do it again?\r\n\r\nIf you've ever tried to setup an application on a new system, or with slightly\r\nupdated pieces, and had it fail, pyinstall requirements are for you.  If you\r\nhaven't had this problem then you will eventually, so pyinstall requirements are\r\nfor you too -- requirements make explicit, repeatable installation of packages.\r\n\r\nSo what are requirements files?  They are very simple: lists of packages to\r\ninstall.  Instead of running something like ``pyinstall MyApp`` and getting\r\nwhatever libraries come along, you can create a requirements file something like::\r\n\r\n    MyApp\r\n    Framework==0.9.4\r\n    Library>=0.2\r\n\r\nThen, regardless of what MyApp lists in ``setup.py``, you'll get a specific\r\nversion of Framework and at least the 0.2 version of Library.  (You might think\r\nyou could list these specific versions in ``setup.py`` -- try it and you'll\r\nquickly see why that doesn't work.)  You can add optional libraries and support\r\ntools that MyApp doesn't strictly require.\r\n\r\nYou can also include \"editable\" packages -- packages that are checked out from\r\nsubversion (in the future other VCS will be supported).  These are just like\r\nusing the ``-e`` option to pyinstall.  They look like::\r\n\r\n    -e svn+http://myrepo/svn/MyApp#egg=MyApp\r\n\r\nYou have to start the URL with ``svn+`` (eventually you'll be able to use\r\n``hg+`` etc), and you have to include ``#egg=Package`` so pyinstall knows what\r\nto expect at that URL.  You can also include ``@rev`` in the URL, e.g., ``@275``\r\nto check out revision 275.\r\n\r\nFreezing Requirements\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nSo you have a working set of packages, and you want to be able to install them\r\nelsewhere.  `Requirements files`_ let you install exact versions, but it won't\r\ntell you what all the exact versions are.\r\n\r\nTo create a new requirements file from a known working environment, use::\r\n\r\n    $ pyinstall.py --freeze=stable-req.txt\r\n\r\nThis will write a listing of *all* installed libraries to ``stable-req.txt``\r\nwith exact versions for every library.  You may want to edit the file down after\r\ngenerating (e.g., to eliminate unnecessary libraries), but it'll give you a\r\nstable starting point for constructing your requirements file.\r\n\r\nYou can also give it an existing requirements file, and it will use that as a\r\nsort of template for the new file.  So if you do::\r\n\r\n    $ pyinstall.py --freeze=stable-req.txt -r devel-req.txt\r\n\r\nit will keep the packages listed in ``devel-req.txt`` in order and preserve\r\ncomments.\r\n\r\nBundles\r\n-------\r\n\r\nAnother way to distribute a set of libraries is a bundle format (specific to\r\npyinstall).  This format is not stable at this time (there simply hasn't been\r\nany feedback, nor a great deal of thought).  A bundle file contains all the\r\nsource for your package, and you can have pyinstall install then all together. \r\nOnce you have the bundle file further network access won't be necessary.  To\r\nbuild a bundle file, do::\r\n\r\n    $ pyinstall.py --bundle=MyApp.pybundle MyApp\r\n\r\n(Using a `requirements file`_ would be wise.)  Then someone else can get the\r\nfile ``MyApp.pybundle`` and run::\r\n\r\n    $ pyinstall.py MyApp.pybundle\r\n\r\nThis is *not* a binary format.  This only packages source.  If you have binary\r\npackages, then the person who installs the files will have to have a compiler,\r\nany necessary headers installed, etc.  Binary packages are hard, this is\r\nrelatively easy.\r\n\r\nUsing pyinstall With virtualenv\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\npyinstall is most nutritious when used with `virtualenv\r\n<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_.  One of the reasons pyinstall\r\ndoesn't install \"multi-version\" eggs is that virtualenv removes much of the need\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\npyinstall does not have to be installed to use it, you can run ``python\r\npyinstall.py`` and it will work.  This is intended to avoid the bootstrapping\r\nproblem of installation.  You can also run pyinstall inside any virtualenv\r\nenvironment, like::\r\n\r\n    $ virtualenv new-env/\r\n    ... creates new-env/ ...\r\n    $ pyinstall.py -E new-env/ MyPackage\r\n\r\nThis is exactly equivalent to::\r\n\r\n    $ ./new-env/bin/python pyinstall.py MyPackage\r\n\r\nExcept, if you have ``virtualenv`` installed and the path ``new-env/``\r\ndoesn't exist, then a new virtualenv will be created.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://pyinstall.openplans.org", "keywords": "easy_install distutils setuptools egg virtualenv", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "pyinstall", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyinstall/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyinstall/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://pyinstall.openplans.org"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyinstall/0.1.4/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Installer for Python packages", "version": "0.1.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> pyinstall has been renamed to <strong>pip</strong>: please see\n<a href=\"http://pip.openplans.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pip.openplans.org</a> or <a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip</a></p>\n<div id=\"contents\">\n<p>Contents</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\" id=\"id2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Introduction</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#community\" id=\"id3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Community</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#differences-from-easy-install\" id=\"id4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Differences From easy_install</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#requirements-files\" id=\"id5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Requirements Files</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#freezing-requirements\" id=\"id6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Freezing Requirements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#bundles\" id=\"id7\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bundles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#using-pyinstall-with-virtualenv\" id=\"id8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Using pyinstall With virtualenv</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"introduction\">\n<h2><a href=\"#id2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Introduction</a></h2>\n<p>pyinstall is a replacement for <a href=\"http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall\" rel=\"nofollow\">easy_install</a>.

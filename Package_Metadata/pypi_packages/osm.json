The minimization takes into account fundamental constraints as well as seismic constraints. Cross-correlations between the seismic constraints are also take into account in the minimization criterion. \n\n* Requirements:\n\n- CESTAM (version 3.2 or newer) : a free code for the calculation of  the structures and evolutions of stars ;\n- python-cestam, a Python library associated with CESTAM (developed by J. Marques), this module is included in the CESTAM package ;\n- ADIPLS : a code for computing adiabatic stellar modes (http://astro.phys.au.dk/~jcd/adipack.n/) ;\n- Python (2.7 or newer) , Numpy and Scipy. \n\n* Installation\n\nYou must first install CETSTAM and ADIPLS, please refer to their associated documentations. To install OSM in your home directory for you own use, type:\npython setup.py install --home=${HOME}\n\nThe components of the OSM library will be installed, depending on your architecture, in $HOME/lib/python or $HOME/lib64/python, while the osm.py executable will be installed in $HOME/bin/.\n\nYou can also install OSM as root for all the users, in that case type:\nsudo python setup.py install\n\n\n* Tutorial:\n\nPlease refer to the PDF document (osm.pdf)\n\n Changes history:\n * 1.4 (17/11/2018) : various minor improvements / can start the calculation from previous results\n * 1.3 (10/07/2018) : changes made to make OSM compatible with python 3\n * 1.2 (22/12/2017) : various minor improvements (e.g. print code version) \n * 1.1 (25/11/2014) : inclusion of the surface effects,  calculation of the condition number of the co-variance matrix, if needed the co-variance matrix is truncated using the SVD, calculation of the reduced Chi2, calculation of the seismic Chi2, compute the condition number of Hessian matrix, and some of minor improvements and bug correction.\n * 1.0 (20/12/2013) : initial working version\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 R.

RCSSmin does syntactical compression only (removing spaces, comments\r\nand possibly semicolons). It does not provide semantic compression (like\r\nremoving empty blocks, collapsing redundant properties etc). It does, however,\r\nsupport various CSS hacks (by keeping them working as intended).\r\n\r\nHere's a feature list:\r\n\r\n- Strings are kept, except that escaped newlines are stripped\r\n- Space/Comments before the very end or before various characters are\r\n  stripped: ``:{});=>],!`` (The colon (``:``) is a special case, a single\r\n  space is kept if it's outside a ruleset.)\r\n- Space/Comments at the very beginning or after various characters are\r\n  stripped: ``{}(=:>[,!``\r\n- Optional space after unicode escapes is kept, resp. replaced by a simple\r\n  space\r\n- whitespaces inside ``url()`` definitions are stripped\r\n- Comments starting with an exclamation mark (``!``) can be kept optionally.\r\n- All other comments and/or whitespace characters are replaced by a single\r\n  space.\r\n- Multiple consecutive semicolons are reduced to one\r\n- The last semicolon within a ruleset is stripped\r\n- CSS Hacks supported:\r\n\r\n  - IE7 hack (``>/**/``)\r\n  - Mac-IE5 hack (``/*\\*/.../**/``)\r\n  - The boxmodelhack is supported naturally because it relies on valid CSS2\r\n    strings\r\n  - Between ``:first-line`` and the following comma or curly brace a space is\r\n    inserted. (apparently it's needed for IE6)\r\n  - Same for ``:first-letter``\r\n\r\nrcssmin.c is a reimplementation of rcssmin.py in C and improves runtime up to\r\nfactor 100 or so (depending on the input). docs/BENCHMARKS in the source\r\ndistribution contains the details.\r\n\r\nBoth python 2 (>= 2.4) and python 3 are supported.\r\n\r\n.. _YUI compressor: https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor/\r\n\r\n.. _the rule list by Isaac Schlueter: https://github.com/isaacs/cssmin/\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright and License\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nCopyright 2011 - 2015\r\nAndr\u00e9 Malo or his licensors, as applicable.\r\n\r\nThe whole package (except for the files in the bench/ directory)\r\nis distributed under the Apache License Version 2.0.

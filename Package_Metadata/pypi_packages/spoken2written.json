European authorities fined Google a record sixty five thousand dollars on Wednesday for abusing its power in the mobile phone market and ordered the company to alter its practices . Furthermore , My T - Shirt size is double X in 2019 and it costs six dollars . My weight is fifty kilograms .\"\n...result=TextTranslator(test)\n...print(result)\n```\nOutput:\n```\nMy life is BBB . European authorities fined Google a record $65000 on Wednesday for abusing its power in the mobile phone market and ordered the company to alter its practices . Furthermore , My T - Shirt size is XX in 2019 and it costs $6 . My weight is 50 kg .\n```\n\n<h1>Features Used to Develop this package</h1>\n\n1. Name Entity Recognition technique is used to detect entities from given input. Name Entity Recognition is done using the library named 'spaCy'. Entities such as QUANTITY (E.g weight: fifty kilograms), MONEY(e.g. amount: thousand dollars), PROPER NOUNS are detected using this technique.\n\n2. The package word2number is used to convert numbers written as 'two thousand' to '2000'. Furthermore, few lines of logical code adds suffix/prefix as $/kg,etc. depending upon type of entity.\n\n3. In some texts entity such as\"double X\" may occur. In this case, the word double acts as adjective followed by X as noun. To detect such texts along with their corresponding parts of speech spacy Token Matcher is used. Again, after detection of entity few lines of logical code will translate \"double X\" to \"XX\".\n\n<b>The logical code for all functions in this package could be found in file spoken2written/spoken2written/spoken2written.py of this repository</b>\n\n<h1>Bugs/ Errors</h1>\nPlease ensure that you have installed dependency en_core_web_sm of spacy before importing package written2spoken.

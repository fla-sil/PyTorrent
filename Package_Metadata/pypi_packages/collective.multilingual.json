Visit the *language tool* in the ZMI to\n          add more languages to the list.\n\nThe translate menu lists each of the supported languages and links to\neither the default view (if already translated), or an add form.\n\nIf a language folder (see below) does not exist for the chosen\nlanguage, the user will first be prompted to create one, using the\n\"Setup language folder\" form. In most cases, the user can click\nstraight through to the add form: sensible form defaults are provided.\n\n\nPlone in multiple languages\n===========================\n\nOut of the box, Plone supports a language setup where language in the\ndefault language lives in the root:\n\n    ``/`` \u21d0 *default content*\n\nThis is also the root for language-neutral content. For other\nlanguages, content in this setup lives in:\n\n    ``/<language-id>/`` \u21d0 *content in other language*\n\nThe *language id* is the `two-letter country code\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2>`_. For instance, for\nDenmark this is ``\"da\"``.\n\nWe'll call these *language folders*. Plone can be set up to\nautomatically change the language of the entire user interface to that\nof the language folder when the user visits a page contained below it.\n\nSetting up a language folder\n----------------------------\n\nYou can either set up language folders manually, or use the \"Setup\nlanguage folder\" form which is shown when you try to add a translation\nfor a content in a language for which a language folder does not\nexist.\n\nIn both cases, you can use any content type which is a \"container\" (it\ncan contain other items). This is typically a folder. The most common\ncontainer type will be suggested by the \"Setup language folder\" form.\n\nNote that a language folder is a navigation root. The\n``INavigationRoot`` interface is automatically added as a marker\ninterface to signal this to Plone's user interface. In practical\nterms, this means for instance that the navigation portlet will use\nthe language folder as the \"root\" content item.\n\n\nTranslation of default pages\n----------------------------\n\nIn Plone, a default page can be selected for a container in which case\nthe page is shown instead of the container as the *default view*.\n\nSince Plone's user interface shows a single interface for the\ncomposition of a container and a default page, we require that the\ncontainer is translated before the default page.\n\n\nThe translation relationship\n----------------------------\n\nThe data structure that records the translation relationship between\ncontent is a `directed acyclic graph\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph>`_:\n\n    Every vertex is a content item, and edges are a translation from one\n    language to another. For example, original content in English might\n    first be translated into German, and then from this translation, into\n    French. This would be a graph with three vertices and two edges.\n\nIn the content model, this is implemented as the ``translations`` set\nrelation where the UUID (universally unique identifier) is used as the\ncontent item reference value.\n\nPlone comes with a behavior that adds a language setting to content\nitems, and this behavior must be enabled in order to translate\ncontent.\n\n\nAPI\n===\n\nThe interface ``ITranslationGraph`` provides a view into the\ntranslation graph for a context that provides the ``IMultilingual``\ninterface (implemented by the \"Multilingual\" behavior).\n\nFor each content object (this will be referred to in the following as\nthe ``context``) We can turn the graph into a mapping from language\nids to content objects, each of which is the ``context`` in some\ntranslation:\n\n>>> graph = ITranslationGraph(context)\n>>> translations = graph.getTranslations()\n\nThe ``translations`` returned are a list of ``(language_id, content)``\nwhich we can pass to the ``dict`` constructor to turn it into a\nmapping object. Note that ``context`` is omitted.\n\n>>> mapping = dict(translations)\n\nFor some applications, we want to establish a relation for each of the\nsupported languages to allow a user or visitor to get to the *nearest*\ncontent object appearing in a supported language of choice. In this\nsituation, nearest will be defined as the closest ancestor\ntranslation:\n\n>>> nearest = graph.getNearestTranslations()\n\nThe ``nearest`` mapping is used to generate the \"Translate\" menu that\nlet's a contributor or editor navigate between the different\ntranslations of a content object.\n\nIt's also used in the language selection viewlet which appears in\nPlone when cookie-based language selection is enabled (see the\nlanguage tool for more information).\n\n\nHistory\n=======\n\nIn 2004, Jarn (formerly Plone Solutions) released `LinguaPlone\n<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.LinguaPlone>`_ which, although\nstill compatible with recent Plone releases, is now in legacy\nstatus. It's recommended that you use this package if you have\n`Archetypes <http://plone.org/products/archetypes>`_ content only.\n\nIn 2005, Ramon Navarro Bosch <r.navarro@iskra.cat> organized a sprint\nin Girona on the subject of multilingual content in Plone. The idea\nwas to take advantage of the component architecture\n(i.e. ``zope.interface`` and ``zope.component``) from the `Zope\nToolkit <http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit/>`_ to model an architecture\nthat could realistically support the diverse requirements for\nmultilingual content. The implementation of this architecture has been\nan on-going process, but as of this writing, beta releases are\navailable for testing. The `plone.app.multilingual\n<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.multilingual>`_ (or PAM) pulls\nin the required dependencies.\n\nNote that PAM supports both Archetypes and Dexterity content. It also\ntries to provide the user experience from LinguaPlone so that users\nfamiliar with this add-on from previous versions of Plone will quickly\nbe able to use it.\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n==========================\n\nHow does *collective.multilingual* compare to *plone.multilingual*?\n\n  This add-on is a brand new implementation. It's an *alternative* to\n  the existing solutions.\n\n  The most important difference is that ``collective.multilingual`` is\n  built for Plone 4. It fully benefits from the new features included\n  in this release.\n\n  The newer platform arguably makes the implementation simple, and\n  this is not just a good thing, it also makes it much easier to\n  maintain the software as a community.\n\n  There's another key difference: *less features*. There is no compare\n  view, and no integration with external translation tools. It's not\n  that we don't want to be \"feature complete\", but some of these\n  features are already provided by the web browser and it's not\n  necessarily a good thing to try and implement these in Plone.\n\n  In short, if you're *not* using the Archetypes content type\n  framework (and you really shouldn't be, if you have a choice), then\n  ``collective.multilingual`` is probably going to work well.\n\nWhat's a *canonical item*?\n\n  This is an item that you have created using Plone's *add* menu and\n  which has been translated into one or more languages.\n\nMust I set a language for my content?\n\n  No. If you don't set the language field, the language is considered\n  neutral. At any given time, this effectively means the site's\n  default language.\n\nCan I have language-independent fields?\n\n  Yes. You can set a value of ``True`` for the tagged value\n  ``\"plone.autoform.languageindependent\"`` or use the included utility\n  function::\n\n    from collective.multilingual.interfaces import setLanguageIndependent\n    from plone.app.dexterity.behaviors.metadata import IDublinCore\n\n    setLanguageIndependent(\n      IDublinCore['contributors'],\n      IDublinCore['creators'],\n      IDublinCore['rights'],\n      )\n\n  This is not just an example. These fields are actually set as\n  language-independent.\n\n  Note that when a field is language-independent, changes are copied\n  into all the content items in the corresponding translation graph.\n\nWhat's the language of newly created content?\n\n  There's a setting in Plone which decides whether this is unset\n  (neutral), or set to the language which is currently the default.\n\n  If content is created using the translate menu, then the language\n  form default will be provided automatically.\n\n\n\nChanges\n=======\n\n1.0.1 (2016-03-30)\n------------------\n\n- Fix issue where a widget that was updated multiple times would\n  result in a circular translation reference.\n  [malthe]\n\n- Fix issue where translating _into_ the default language would ignore translated parents\n  and place the new translation in the site root.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Always show \"Clear...\" and \"This is a translation of...\" menu items for context, even if context is a default page.\n  [tmog]\n\n- check to make sure we do not add multiple translations for one language.

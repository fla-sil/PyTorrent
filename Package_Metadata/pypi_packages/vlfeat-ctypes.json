In practice, though, a significant\namount of the library lies in the MATLAB interface.\nThis project is a port of a few functions from that interface to python/numpy,\nusing ctypes. It contains only a few functions\n(the ones needed for `py-sdm <http://github.com/dougalsutherland/py-sdm>`_).\nThe process isn't very hard, it just takes some effort.\nPatches adding additional functionality are welcome.\n\nThere's also a fork of vlfeat floating around that includes Boost::Python\nwrappers. I couldn't get it to work, and didn't try too hard because I saw that\nsome of the functions I needed had significant amounts of matlab code anyway.\nYou might be more interested in it, though;\n`Andreas Mueller's version <https://github.com/amueller/vlfeat/>`_\nappears to be the most recently updated.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe package can be installed by ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` normally.

You can either install ``libvl.so`` (or your platform's equivalent)\nsomewhere where ctypes can find it yourself, or use the included script for\ndoing so; run it with ``python -m vlfeat.download``. If you add a ``-h``\nargument, it'll show you how to do it with a pre-downloaded binary distribution.\nIf you install Python packages with ``sudo``, you may need to do the same for\nthe download script.\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/dougalsutherland/vlfeat-ctypes", "keywords": "", "license": "BSD", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "vlfeat-ctypes", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/vlfeat-ctypes/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/vlfeat-ctypes/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/dougalsutherland/vlfeat-ctypes"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/vlfeat-ctypes/0.1.5/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "A minimal ctypes-based port of some vlfeat functions.", "version": "0.1.5", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>This is a minimal port of a few components of the matlab interface of\n<a href=\"http://www.vlfeat.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">the vlfeat library</a> for computer vision to Python.</p>\n<p>vlfeat\u2019s core library is written in C.

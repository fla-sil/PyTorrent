It then selects reads within a specified number of restriction sites from the diagonal(default = 2) and models the background as a negative binomial. It calls peaks regions that significantly exceed the background.\nThe output is a list of peaks with their properties and a bedgraph at a restriction site level resolution that describes the reads per site.\nUsing the differential analysis command it can be used to create a consensus peakset and then identify differentially bound regions across samples.\n\nResults from this package can then be used for further analysis and as a peaks dataset input for various loop calling software.\n\n### Table of Contents \n- [HiChIP peaks](#HiChIP-peaks)\n    - [Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)\n  - [Getting started](#Getting-started)\n    - [Installation](#Installation)\n    - [Usage](#Usage)\n      - [Peak calling](#Peak-calling)\n      - [Example run](#Example-run)\n      - [Differential peak analysis](#Differential-peak-analysis)\n  - [Authors](#Authors)\n  - [License](#License)\n  - [Citation](#Citation)\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Installation\n\nThe package requires bedtools to run.

The 3 extra information columns are:\n  * average signal in the peak\n  * maximum signal in the peak\n  * -log10 of p value of the peak\n- report.pdf, contains some useful plots and quality metrics.\n\nIf enabled this command will also generate:\n- diffpeak_data.pickle, file containing the information necessary for differential peak analysis.\n- mat_obj.pickle, file containing the sparse matrix representation at a restriction site level of all the interactions. Currently in development but you can look into site_matrix_class.py to understand how it works.\n\n#### Example run\nAssuming the data is in HICPRO_RESULTS/hic_results/data/sample/ and installation of HiC-Pro is in HICPRO_dir/\nYou can run the software with the following command:\n\n```\npeak_call -i HICPRO_RESULTS/hic_results/data/sample/ -o ./results -r HICPRO_dir/annotation/MboI_resfrag_hg38.bed \n\n```\nSome example results can be found in [example_results](https://github.com/ChenfuShi/HiChIP_peaks/tree/master/example_results).\n\n#### Differential peak analysis\n\nRun the previous commands with the --keepdiff flag enabled. This will produce a temporary file that can be used with the diff_peaks command to integrate all samples together. This utility will look for all the correct files in a specified folder, merge the peaks at a fragment site level a produce a table with the signal in each peak from each sample. This can then be imported in R or others and analysed using DESeq2 or other differential expression analysis tools. See example R script for inspiration.\n\n```\nusage: diff_peaks [-h] -i hichip_peaks_RESULTS -o OUTPUT_FILE -r RESFRAG\n                  [-a SIZES] [-m MINIMUM]\n\ninput directory with outputfiles from peak_call and create table for\ndifferential analysis.

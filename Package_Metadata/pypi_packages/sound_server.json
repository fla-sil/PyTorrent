Sounds can then be triggered and manipulated remotely over OSC (e.g. fading in and out tracks, 3D positioning of sounds). This allows\nconfiguration and remote triggering/manipluation of sounds over a network. This software was designed for adding audio to interactive art installations and similar; \nit is probably not suitable for gaming or real-time musical applications.\n\nSound generation is via **pyfmodex**, which in turn wraps the high performance **FMODEx** library, which is used to render the sounds.  Most **FMODEx** features are supported. \n\nThe server also supports autonomous fades, and automations for making filter changes, position movements, and pitch adjustment using random, periodic or spline based patterns. It supports\nstochastic sound generation, so that random sounds can be generated server-side according to a fairly flexible random generation model.\n\nExample OSC messages::\n\n    # create a new transient sound mysound_0\n    /sound_server/spawn mysound mysound_0\n    \n    # set the gain to -80dB\n    /sound_server/gain mysound_0 -80    \n    \n    # start the sound playing\n    /sound_server/start mysound_0\n    \n    # start a fade up to 0dB over the next 5 seconds\n    /sound_server/gain mysound_0 0 5.0\n\nRequires **numpy**, **pyfmodex** and **simpleOSC**. \n\n*Note:* this is currently Python 2.x only.

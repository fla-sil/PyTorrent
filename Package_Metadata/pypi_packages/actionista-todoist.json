You can then sort, print, and reschedule the selected tasks.\n\n*Actionista* Action-Chain CLI for Todoist (actionista-todoist)\nis inspired by the powerful `find` command line tool. It takes the \"chain of actions\"\napproach that `find` uses to find and select files on your harddisk,\nand applies it for managing your Todoist task list.\n\nThe successful `find` utility works by supplying a sequence of \"actions\"\n(also known as \"expressions\" in the `find` manual).\n\nMost actions are essentially filters, where you list criteria for the files to find.\nHowever, the real usability of `find` is that it can not only print the matching files,\nbut also use the matching files for other actions, e.g. deleting the files,\nor sending them to other command line tools.\n\nThe *actionista* action-chain CLI takes a similar approach.\nStarting from the full list of tasks, you can apply filters to find exactly those tasks that you need.\nTogether with other actions, you can `print`, `reschedule`, `rename`, `mark-complete`, or `delete`\nwhatever tasks you need.\nYou can invoke as many actions as you need, both filters and other actions, in any order.\nThe actions are invoked in exactly the order you specify.\n\n\nSo if you want, you can filter tasks by e.g. project name, and print all tasks in a given project,\nthen filter by due date, and print again, then reschedule the tasks that were just printed,\nthen filter by exact name, then mark that (or those) remaining task(s) as complete,\nand finally commit the changes to the server.\nThis example is mostly just to show what is possible,\nand I personally wouldn't recommend having such a complex list of actions,\nbut you are basically free to list as many (or as few) actions as you want or need.\nFor the record, doing the described sequence of actions would look something like this:\n\n    $ todoist-action-cli -project Wedding -print \\\n        -due before today \\\n        -print \\\n        -reschedule tomorrow \\\n        -name startswith \"Pick up the rings\" \\\n        -rename \"Remind Tommy to pick up the rings\" \\\n        -commit\n\n\nUsually, for your own sanity, command line usage would be a little more simple, and have only a single \"purpose\"\nwith each invocation:\n\n    # Basic example: Find tasks containing the string \"rings\":\n\n    $ todoist-action-cli -sync -name \"*rings*\" -sort -print\n\n\n\nThe generalized command line usage is:\n\n    $ todoist-action-cli [-action [args]] [-action [args]] [...]\n\n\nYou can also import the package from python:\n\n    >>> import actionista.todoist\n    >>> import actionista.todoist.action_cli\n\nNote: This package was formerly imported as ``rsenv.rstodo.todoist_action_cli``,\nbut has now been separated into its own package, imported as: ``actionista.todoist_action_cli``.\n\n\nNOTE: This application is not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Doist.\nIt is a third-party command line utility that is making use of the official Todoist API,\nas documented by https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v8/.\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n-------------\n\n\n### Installation with ``pipx``:\n\nFor regular end-users, I recommend using ``pipx`` to install the Actionista-Todoist command line apps:\n\n\t$ pipx install actionista-todoist\n\nIf you don't have pipx installed, you can refer to the\n[pipx installation guide](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/installation/).\nBriefly:\n\n\t$ pip install pipx\n\t$ pipx ensurepath\n\nThe last step will add `~/.local/bin` to the PATH environment variable.\nPlease make sure to close and restart your terminal/command prompt after\ninstalling pipx for the first time.\n\n\nKnown installation errors:\n\n* If you are using ``conda``, there is a known issue where you receive an error,\n  \"Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:\", when trying to install packages with ``pipx``.\n  If you get this error, please update your ``conda`` python and make sure you are only using\n  the \"defaults\" channel, *not* \"conda-forge\".\n\n\n### Installation with ``pip``:\n\nTo install distribution release package from the Python Packaging Index (PyPI):\n\n    $ pip install -U actionista-todoist\n\n\nAlternatively, install the latest git master source by fetching the git repository from github\nand install the package in editable mode (development mode):\n\n    $ git clone git@github.com:scholer/actionista-todoist && cd actionista-todoist\n    $ pip install -U -e .\n\n\n\nCONFIGURATION:\n--------------\n\nOnce ``actionista-todoist`` package is installed, you need to obtain a login token from the todoist website:\nLog into your todoist.com account, go to ``Settings -> Integrations``, and copy the API token.\n(You can also go directly to the page: https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations).\n\nNow run:\n\n\t$ actionista-todoist-config\n\nto set up the login token with your Actionista-Todoist installation.\nThe API token is stored in ``~/.todoist_token.txt``.\nThe ``actionista-todoist-config`` command will also create a default config file,\n``~/.todoist_config.yaml``, which you can edit to change default sorting and printing format.\n\nIf you re-set your Todoist API token, you can update it either by running:\n\n\t$ actionista-todoist-config --token <your-token-here>\n\nor by manually editing the file ``~/.todoist_token.txt`` and place your token in here.\n\n\n\nUSAGE:\n------\n\nThe ``actionista-todoist`` package contains several command line apps (CLIs):\n\n* ``todoist-action-cli`` - also available as ``actionista-todoist``.\n* ``todoist-cli``.\n* ``actionista-todoist-config``.\n\n\nThe ``todoist-action-cli`` CLI program uses the \"action chain\" approach, where you specify a sequence\nof \"actions\", which are used to filter/select tasks from Todoist and then sort, print, or reschedule\nthe selected tasks in a batch-wise fashion.\n\nThe ``todoist-cli`` CLI program is used mostly for things that doesn't fit the \"action chain\" philosophy.\nFor instance, if you want to add a new task, that doesn't really fit into the ``todoist-action-cli``\nworkflow.(*) Instead, you can use ``todoist-cli add-task`` command to add a new task to Todoist.\nThe ``todoist-cli`` is also used for other things, e.g. printing a list of your projects, etc.\nYou can run ``todoist-cli --help`` to see all available commands.\n\nFinally, the ``actionista-todoist-config`` CLI program is used to set up Actionista-Todoist,\nconfiguring your API login token, and creating a default configuration file.\n\n\n(*) The ``todoist-action-cli`` can technically be used to add tasks to Todoist, using the\n``-add-task`` action command - however, this is not the recommended approach.\n\n\n\n\n### `todoist-action-cli` usage:\n\n\nThe general command line usage is:\n\n    $ todoist-action-cli [actions]\n    $ todoist-action-cli [-action [args]]\n\nWhere ``action`` is one of the following actions:\n\n    # Sorting and printing tasks:\n\n      -print                 Print tasks, using a python format string.\n      -sort                  Sort the list of tasks, by task attribute in ascending or descending order.\n\n    # Task selection (filtering):\n\n      -filter                Generic task filtering method based on comparison with a specific task attribute.\n      -has                   Generic task filtering method based on comparison with a specific task attribute.\n      -is                    Special -is filter for ad-hoc or frequently-used cases, e.g. `-is not checked`, etc.\n      -not                   Convenience `-not` action, just an alias for `-is not`. Can be used as e.g. `-not recurring`.\n      -due                   Special `-due [when]` filter. Is just an alias for `-is due [when]`.\n      -contains              Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"contains\".\n      -startswith            Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"startswith\".\n      -endswith              Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"endswith\".\n      -glob                  Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"glob\".\n      -iglob                 Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"iglob\".\n      -eq                    Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"eq\".\n      -ieq                   Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"ieq\".\n      -content               Convenience adaptor to filter tasks based on the 'content' attribute (default op_name 'iglob').\n      -name                  Convenience adaptor to filter tasks based on the 'content' attribute (default op_name 'iglob').\n      -project               Convenience adaptor for filter action using taskkey=\"project_name\" (default op_name \"iglob\").\n      -priority              Convenience adaptor for filter action using taskkey=\"priority\" (default op_name \"eq\").\n      -priority-eq           Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"priority\", op_name=\"eq\".\n      -priority-ge           Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"priority\", op_name=\"ge\".\n      -priority-str          Convenience adaptor for filter action using taskkey=\"priority_str\" (default op_name \"eq\").\n      -priority-str-eq       Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"priority_str\", op_name=\"eq\".\n      -p1                    Filter tasks including only tasks with priority 'p1'.\n      -p2                    Filter tasks including only tasks with priority 'p2'.\n      -p3                    Filter tasks including only tasks with priority 'p3'.\n      -p4                    Filter tasks including only tasks with priority 'p3'.\n\n    # Updating tasks:\n\n      -reschedule            Reschedule tasks to a new date/time.\n      -mark-completed        Mark tasks as completed using method='close'.\n      -mark-as-done          Mark tasks as completed using method='close'.\n\n    # Synchronizing and committing changes with the server:\n\n      -sync                  Pull task updates from the server to synchronize the local task data cache.\n      -commit                Commit is a sync that includes local commands from the queue, emptying the queue. Raises SyncError.\n      -show-queue            Show list of API commands in the POST queue.\n      -delete-cache          Delete local todoist data cache.\n      -print-queue           Show list of API commands in the POST queue.\n\n    # Program behavior:\n\n      -verbose, -v           Increase program informational output verbosity.\n      -yes, -y               Disable confirmation prompt before enacting irreversible commands, e.g. -commit.\n      -help, -h              Print help messages. Use `-help <action>` to get help on a particular action.\n\nTo see how to use each filter, type:\n\n    $ todoist-action-cli -help <action_name>\n\nE.g.:\n\n    $ todoist-action-cli -help project\n    $ todoist-action-cli -help filter\n    $ todoist-action-cli -help reschedule\n\n\n\nAs you can see, typical usage is:\n\n    $ todoist-action-cli -sync [one or more filter actions to select the tasks] -sort -print\n\nThe filter actions could be e.g. filtering by ``-name`` (same as ``-content``),\n``project``, ``due_date_local_iso``, etc.\nThe ``-sync`` action is optional; if you do not specify ``-sync``, the program will just re-use the old cache,\nfrom last time you invoked ``-sync``. You must invoke ``-sync`` at least once, when you first install this package,\nand you should always ``-sync`` if you have made any changes (e.g. from your phone) since your last sync.\nFinally, the ``-sort`` and ``-print`` commands will sort and print the selected tasks.\n\nIf you need to refine your filters, just run the command again. The data is cached locally,\nso if you omit the ``-sync`` action, commands can be executed in rapid succession.\n\n\nAnother example, to reschedule the due date for a bunch of tasks, would look like:\n\n    $ todoist-action-cli [-sync] [filter actions] [-sort] [-print] -reschedule \"Apr 21\" -commit\n\n\n*NOTE: I **strongly** recommend that you ``-print`` the filtered tasks before you\n``-rename`` or ``-reschedule`` the tasks. When you invoke ``-commit``, the changes cannot be undone automatically,\nso you may easily end up with a bunch of identically-named tasks with the same due date, if you forgot to\napply the correct selection filters before renaming or rescheduling the tasks!\nFor this reason, the program will, by default, ask you for confirmation before every `-commit`.*\n\n\n#### Action arguments:\n\nEach action can be provided a set of arguments which are listed sequentially, separated by space.\nIf one argument contains spaces, e.g. you are filtering by tasks in the project \"Meeting notes\",\nthen you need to quote the argument as such:\n\n    $ todoist-action-cli -sync -project \"Meeting notes\" -sort \"project_name,content\" ascending -print\n\nHere, we provided one argument to the ``-project`` action (``\"Meeting notes\"``),\nand two arguments to the ``-sort`` action (``\"project_name,content\"`` and ``ascending``).\n\nSome of the actions attempts to be \"clever\" when interpreting the arguments given.\nFor instance, when filtering by project, you can do either:\n\n    $ todoist-action-cli -project \"Wedding*\"\n    $ todoist-action-cli -project glob \"Wedding*\"\n    $ todoist-action-cli -project startswith Wedding\n\nThe general signature for the ``-project`` action is:\n\n    $ todoist-action-cli -project [operator] value\n\nHere, ``[operator]`` is the name of one of the many registered binary operators.\nThese are used to compare the tasks against a given value.\nIn the example above, if you do not specify any operator, then the \"glob\" operator is used.\nThe \"glob\" operator allows you to use wild-cards for selecting tasks, the same way you select files on the command line.\nIn our case, we \"glob\" against tasks with project name starting with the string \"Wedding*\".\nWe could also have used the \"startswith\" operator, and omit the asterisk:  ``startswith Wedding``.\n\nFor more info on how to use operators, see:\n\n    $ todoist-action-cli -help operators\n\n\n\n\n\nAd-hoc CLI:\n------------\n\nInstalling this project (``actionista-todoist``) with ``pip`` will also give you some\n\"ad-hoc\" command line interface entry points:\n\n    $ todoist-adhoc <command> <args>\n    $ todoist-adhoc print-query <query> [<print-fmt>]\n    $ todoist-adhoc print-completed-today [<print-fmt>]\n    $ todoist-adhoc print-today-or-overdue-items [<print-fmt>]\n\n    # And a couple of endpoints with convenient defaults, e.g.:\n\n    $ todoist_today_or_overdue\n\n\n\n\nPrior art: Other python-based Todoist projects\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n#### Other Todoist CLI packages that I know about:\n\n* [todoist-cli](https://pypi.org/project/todoist-cli/0.0.1/) -\n    A command line interface for batch creating Todoist tasks from a file.\n    Makes manual requests against the web API url (rather than using the official todoist-python package).\n    No updates since January 2016 (except `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`).\n    This probably doesn't work, given that it uses an old, obsolete API endpoint URL.\n\n* [todoicli](https://pypi.org/project/todoicli/) - A rather new project (as of April 2018).\n    Focuses on pre-defined queries for listing tasks, e.g. \"today and overdue\", \"next 7 days\", etc.\n    Lots of other functionality, pretty extensive code base.\n    Has integration with the toggl.com time tracking service.\n    Uses the official ``todoist-python`` package, but still uses the \n    \"universal UTC\" time format from the old v7 Sync API, and the v7 due-date structure.\n    That means it probably won't work anymore, given that the v7 Sync API has been deprecated,\n    and the `todoist-python` package has switched to Sync API v8.\n    For instance, the `list td` and `list n7` uses `item['due_date_utc']`, which will raise \n    a `KeyError` with the new v8 data structure.\n    The CLI also expects `IDs` (`task_id`, `label_id`, `project_id`), rather than text names,\n    making it rather difficult to use for the end user.\n\n* [pydoist](https://pypi.org/project/Pydoist/) - A basic CLI to add Todoist tasks from the command line.\n    Uses the official `todoist-python` python API from Todoist.\n    Lastest release was November 2016, so may not work with the new v8 Sync API.\n\n\n#### Other general python Todoist packages:\n\n* [python-todoist](https://pypi.org/project/todoist-python/) - The official python \n    'Todoist' package from Doist (the company behind Todoist).\n    Is currently using the version 8.0 \"Sync\" API.\n\n* [pytodoist](https://pypi.org/project/pytodoist/) - An alternative Todoist API package.\n  Also uses the v7 Sync API.\n  A rather different approach to API wrapping, perhaps more object oriented.\n  Focused on modelling individual Users/Projects/Tasks/Notes,\n  where the official todoist-python package has *managers* as the central unit\n  (ItemsManager, ProjectsManager, NotesManager).\n\n  * Last update November 2016 - will be obsolete when the v7 Sync API is removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/scholer/actionista-todoist", "keywords": "Todoist,Tasks,Productivity,TODO,GTD,CLI", "license": "GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "actionista-todoist", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/actionista-todoist/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/actionista-todoist/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/scholer/actionista-todoist"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/actionista-todoist/2019.9.16/", "requires_dist": ["todoist-python (>=8.0)", "pyyaml", "pytz", "python-dateutil", "dateparser", "parsedatetime", "click"], "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "Actionista Action CLI for Todoist.

Integrations</code>, and copy the API token.\n(You can also go directly to the page: <a href=\"https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations</a>).</p>\n<p>Now run:</p>\n<pre><code>$ actionista-todoist-config\n</code></pre>\n<p>to set up the login token with your Actionista-Todoist installation.\nThe API token is stored in <code>~/.todoist_token.txt</code>.\nThe <code>actionista-todoist-config</code> command will also create a default config file,\n<code>~/.todoist_config.yaml</code>, which you can edit to change default sorting and printing format.</p>\n<p>If you re-set your Todoist API token, you can update it either by running:</p>\n<pre><code>$ actionista-todoist-config --token &lt;your-token-here&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>or by manually editing the file <code>~/.todoist_token.txt</code> and place your token in here.</p>\n<h2>USAGE:</h2>\n<p>The <code>actionista-todoist</code> package contains several command line apps (CLIs):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>todoist-action-cli</code> - also available as <code>actionista-todoist</code>.</li>\n<li><code>todoist-cli</code>.</li>\n<li><code>actionista-todoist-config</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>todoist-action-cli</code> CLI program uses the \"action chain\" approach, where you specify a sequence\nof \"actions\", which are used to filter/select tasks from Todoist and then sort, print, or reschedule\nthe selected tasks in a batch-wise fashion.</p>\n<p>The <code>todoist-cli</code> CLI program is used mostly for things that doesn't fit the \"action chain\" philosophy.\nFor instance, if you want to add a new task, that doesn't really fit into the <code>todoist-action-cli</code>\nworkflow.(*) Instead, you can use <code>todoist-cli add-task</code> command to add a new task to Todoist.\nThe <code>todoist-cli</code> is also used for other things, e.g. printing a list of your projects, etc.\nYou can run <code>todoist-cli --help</code> to see all available commands.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <code>actionista-todoist-config</code> CLI program is used to set up Actionista-Todoist,\nconfiguring your API login token, and creating a default configuration file.</p>\n<p>(*) The <code>todoist-action-cli</code> can technically be used to add tasks to Todoist, using the\n<code>-add-task</code> action command - however, this is not the recommended approach.</p>\n<h3><code>todoist-action-cli</code> usage:</h3>\n<p>The general command line usage is:</p>\n<pre><code>$ todoist-action-cli [actions]\n$ todoist-action-cli [-action [args]]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where <code>action</code> is one of the following actions:</p>\n<pre><code># Sorting and printing tasks:\n\n  -print                 Print tasks, using a python format string.\n  -sort                  Sort the list of tasks, by task attribute in ascending or descending order.\n\n# Task selection (filtering):\n\n  -filter                Generic task filtering method based on comparison with a specific task attribute.\n  -has                   Generic task filtering method based on comparison with a specific task attribute.\n  -is                    Special -is filter for ad-hoc or frequently-used cases, e.g. `-is not checked`, etc.\n  -not                   Convenience `-not` action, just an alias for `-is not`. Can be used as e.g. `-not recurring`.\n  -due                   Special `-due [when]` filter. Is just an alias for `-is due [when]`.\n  -contains              Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"contains\".\n  -startswith            Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"startswith\".\n  -endswith              Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"endswith\".\n  -glob                  Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"glob\".\n  -iglob                 Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"iglob\".\n  -eq                    Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"eq\".\n  -ieq                   Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"content\", op_name=\"ieq\".\n  -content               Convenience adaptor to filter tasks based on the 'content' attribute (default op_name 'iglob').\n  -name                  Convenience adaptor to filter tasks based on the 'content' attribute (default op_name 'iglob').\n  -project               Convenience adaptor for filter action using taskkey=\"project_name\" (default op_name \"iglob\").\n  -priority              Convenience adaptor for filter action using taskkey=\"priority\" (default op_name \"eq\").\n  -priority-eq           Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"priority\", op_name=\"eq\".\n  -priority-ge           Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"priority\", op_name=\"ge\".\n  -priority-str          Convenience adaptor for filter action using taskkey=\"priority_str\" (default op_name \"eq\").\n  -priority-str-eq       Convenience filter action using taskkey=\"priority_str\", op_name=\"eq\".\n  -p1                    Filter tasks including only tasks with priority 'p1'.\n  -p2                    Filter tasks including only tasks with priority 'p2'.\n  -p3                    Filter tasks including only tasks with priority 'p3'.\n  -p4                    Filter tasks including only tasks with priority 'p3'.\n\n# Updating tasks:\n\n  -reschedule            Reschedule tasks to a new date/time.\n  -mark-completed        Mark tasks as completed using method='close'.\n  -mark-as-done          Mark tasks as completed using method='close'.\n\n# Synchronizing and committing changes with the server:\n\n  -sync                  Pull task updates from the server to synchronize the local task data cache.\n  -commit                Commit is a sync that includes local commands from the queue, emptying the queue. Raises SyncError.\n  -show-queue            Show list of API commands in the POST queue.\n  -delete-cache          Delete local todoist data cache.\n  -print-queue           Show list of API commands in the POST queue.\n\n# Program behavior:\n\n  -verbose, -v           Increase program informational output verbosity.\n  -yes, -y               Disable confirmation prompt before enacting irreversible commands, e.g. -commit.\n  -help, -h              Print help messages. Use `-help &lt;action&gt;` to get help on a particular action.\n</code></pre>\n<p>To see how to use each filter, type:</p>\n<pre><code>$ todoist-action-cli -help &lt;action_name&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>E.g.:</p>\n<pre><code>$ todoist-action-cli -help project\n$ todoist-action-cli -help filter\n$ todoist-action-cli -help reschedule\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, typical usage is:</p>\n<pre><code>$ todoist-action-cli -sync [one or more filter actions to select the tasks] -sort -print\n</code></pre>\n<p>The filter actions could be e.g. filtering by <code>-name</code> (same as <code>-content</code>),\n<code>project</code>, <code>due_date_local_iso</code>, etc.\nThe <code>-sync</code> action is optional; if you do not specify <code>-sync</code>, the program will just re-use the old cache,\nfrom last time you invoked <code>-sync</code>. You must invoke <code>-sync</code> at least once, when you first install this package,\nand you should always <code>-sync</code> if you have made any changes (e.g. from your phone) since your last sync.\nFinally, the <code>-sort</code> and <code>-print</code> commands will sort and print the selected tasks.</p>\n<p>If you need to refine your filters, just run the command again. The data is cached locally,\nso if you omit the <code>-sync</code> action, commands can be executed in rapid succession.</p>\n<p>Another example, to reschedule the due date for a bunch of tasks, would look like:</p>\n<pre><code>$ todoist-action-cli [-sync] [filter actions] [-sort] [-print] -reschedule \"Apr 21\" -commit\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>NOTE: I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you <code>-print</code> the filtered tasks before you\n<code>-rename</code> or <code>-reschedule</code> the tasks. When you invoke <code>-commit</code>, the changes cannot be undone automatically,\nso you may easily end up with a bunch of identically-named tasks with the same due date, if you forgot to\napply the correct selection filters before renaming or rescheduling the tasks!\nFor this reason, the program will, by default, ask you for confirmation before every <code>-commit</code>.</em></p>\n<h4>Action arguments:</h4>\n<p>Each action can be provided a set of arguments which are listed sequentially, separated by space.\nIf one argument contains spaces, e.g. you are filtering by tasks in the project \"Meeting notes\",\nthen you need to quote the argument as such:</p>\n<pre><code>$ todoist-action-cli -sync -project \"Meeting notes\" -sort \"project_name,content\" ascending -print\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we provided one argument to the <code>-project</code> action (<code>\"Meeting notes\"</code>),\nand two arguments to the <code>-sort</code> action (<code>\"project_name,content\"</code> and <code>ascending</code>).</p>\n<p>Some of the actions attempts to be \"clever\" when interpreting the arguments given.\nFor instance, when filtering by project, you can do either:</p>\n<pre><code>$ todoist-action-cli -project \"Wedding*\"\n$ todoist-action-cli -project glob \"Wedding*\"\n$ todoist-action-cli -project startswith Wedding\n</code></pre>\n<p>The general signature for the <code>-project</code> action is:</p>\n<pre><code>$ todoist-action-cli -project [operator] value\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, <code>[operator]</code> is the name of one of the many registered binary operators.\nThese are used to compare the tasks against a given value.\nIn the example above, if you do not specify any operator, then the \"glob\" operator is used.\nThe \"glob\" operator allows you to use wild-cards for selecting tasks, the same way you select files on the command line.\nIn our case, we \"glob\" against tasks with project name starting with the string \"Wedding*\".\nWe could also have used the \"startswith\" operator, and omit the asterisk:  <code>startswith Wedding</code>.</p>\n<p>For more info on how to use operators, see:</p>\n<pre><code>$ todoist-action-cli -help operators\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Ad-hoc CLI:</h2>\n<p>Installing this project (<code>actionista-todoist</code>) with <code>pip</code> will also give you some\n\"ad-hoc\" command line interface entry points:</p>\n<pre><code>$ todoist-adhoc &lt;command&gt; &lt;args&gt;\n$ todoist-adhoc print-query &lt;query&gt; [&lt;print-fmt&gt;]\n$ todoist-adhoc print-completed-today [&lt;print-fmt&gt;]\n$ todoist-adhoc print-today-or-overdue-items [&lt;print-fmt&gt;]\n\n# And a couple of endpoints with convenient defaults, e.g.:\n\n$ todoist_today_or_overdue\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Prior art: Other python-based Todoist projects</h2>\n<h4>Other Todoist CLI packages that I know about:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/todoist-cli/0.0.1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">todoist-cli</a> -\nA command line interface for batch creating Todoist tasks from a file.\nMakes manual requests against the web API url (rather than using the official todoist-python package).\nNo updates since January 2016 (except <code>setup.py</code> and <code>requirements.txt</code>).\nThis probably doesn't work, given that it uses an old, obsolete API endpoint URL.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/todoicli/\" rel=\"nofollow\">todoicli</a> - A rather new project (as of April 2018).\nFocuses on pre-defined queries for listing tasks, e.g. \"today and overdue\", \"next 7 days\", etc.\nLots of other functionality, pretty extensive code base.\nHas integration with the toggl.com time tracking service.\nUses the official <code>todoist-python</code> package, but still uses the\n\"universal UTC\" time format from the old v7 Sync API, and the v7 due-date structure.\nThat means it probably won't work anymore, given that the v7 Sync API has been deprecated,\nand the <code>todoist-python</code> package has switched to Sync API v8.\nFor instance, the <code>list td</code> and <code>list n7</code> uses <code>item['due_date_utc']</code>, which will raise\na <code>KeyError</code> with the new v8 data structure.\nThe CLI also expects <code>IDs</code> (<code>task_id</code>, <code>label_id</code>, <code>project_id</code>), rather than text names,\nmaking it rather difficult to use for the end user.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/Pydoist/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pydoist</a> - A basic CLI to add Todoist tasks from the command line.\nUses the official <code>todoist-python</code> python API from Todoist.\nLastest release was November 2016, so may not work with the new v8 Sync API.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Other general python Todoist packages:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/todoist-python/\" rel=\"nofollow\">python-todoist</a> - The official python\n'Todoist' package from Doist (the company behind Todoist).\nIs currently using the version 8.0 \"Sync\" API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pytodoist/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pytodoist</a> - An alternative Todoist API package.\nAlso uses the v7 Sync API.\nA rather different approach to API wrapping, perhaps more object oriented.\nFocused on modelling individual Users/Projects/Tasks/Notes,\nwhere the official todoist-python package has <em>managers</em> as the central unit\n(ItemsManager, ProjectsManager, NotesManager).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Last update November 2016 - will be obsolete when the v7 Sync API is removed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n          </div>"}, "last_serial": 5837472, "releases":

There is a lot of good code too small to be legitimate packages on their own, that you \nend up copying over and over again to your codebase. Snipty wants to:\n\n* automate the process of downloading snippets from remote snippet websites,\n* manage a `snipty.yml` file to explicitly enumerate your snippet dependencies in the code,\n* allow easy tracking of snippets changes when they are made in your codebase and/or in the snippet source.\n\nYou can read about [how Snipty was born and what problem it tries to address](https://medium.com/@krisdorosz/how-to-use-code-snippets-and-stay-sane-987a2a54c571) in the Medium post.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n### Snippet installation\n\nWe assume you store snippets somewhere in the snippets websites (like Github gist or ghostbin).\nTo install snippet in your code base go to the codebase root and type:\n\n    $ snipty install  helpers/example_1.py https://ghostbin.com/paste/egbue\n    \u2714\ufe0f Snippet helpers/example_1 installed from https://ghostbin.com/paste/egbue\n\n    $ ls helpers\n    __init__.py  example_1.py\n\nSnipty detects that this is python snippet (by given extension) \nand automatically creates  `__init__.py` on all subdirectories up to the project root path,\nso your snippet will be importable from python.\n\n\nAt this point a special file `snipty.yml` was created in your codebase. You should track this file in your\ncode versioning system.\n\n\n### Snippets with multiple files inside\n\nSome snippet sites - like gist - allows you to define multiple files under a single URL. Snipty handles this by creating \na directory (rather than a single file) and places all snippet files inside this directory.\n\nInstall snippets that have multiple files inside:\n\n    $ snipty install helpers/django https://gist.github.com/cypreess/6670a99b2c1cd7b52b24057f68a1debd \n    \u2714\ufe0f Snippet helpers/django installed from https://gist.github.com/cypreess/6670a99b2c1cd7b52b24057f68a1debd\n\n    $ ls helpers/django\n    __init__.py  left_pad.py  middleware.py\n\n\n### Deleting and moving snippets\n\nOnce snippet is installed it cannot be installed again to different location as snipty will warn you about \npossible code duplication.\n\n    $ snipty install snippets/a https://gist.github.com/cypreess/bc7b4d7c46b9a4cf1411c87b5c65d3d5 \n    \u2714\ufe0f Snippet snippets/a installed from https://gist.github.com/cypreess/bc7b4d7c46b9a4cf1411c87b5c65d3d5\n\n    $ snipty install snippets/a https://gist.github.com/cypreess/bc7b4d7c46b9a4cf1411c87b5c65d3d5 \n    Snippet 'snippets/a' has been already installed.\n\n\n### Snippets maintenance\n\nTo check if your snippets in your codebase differ from the remote links type:\n\n    $ snipty check \n    \u2714 Snippet snippets/left_pad present and up to date.\n\nor for single package:\n\n    $ snipty check snippets/left_pad\n    \u2714 Snippet snippets/left_pad present and up to date.\n\nYou can turn on diff displaying by adding argument `--diff`:\n\n    snipty check --diff snippets/left_pad\n    \u274c Snippet snippets/left_pad file left_pad.py is not present.\n    \u274c Snippet snippets/left_pad file middleware.py has changed.\n      class EmptyMiddleware:\n    +   middleware_empty = True\n    -   pass\n\nCheck will produce exit status of 0 if all snippets are unchanged, otherwise exit status will be equal to number of \nchanged snippets count.\n\n## Helpful environment variables:\n\n* `SNIPTY_PYTHON` - python interpreter that snipty should use to run itself\n* `SNIPTY_ROOT_PATH` - default snipty behaviour is to treat all relative paths according to current directory; \nit can be ovveriden using this path or `-p`/`--path` argument\n* `SNIPTY_TMP` - ovveride temporary directory for downloading snippets\n\n## Help needed\n\nPull requests are very welcome.\n\n- More downloaders needed\n- Tests needed!\n- Docs needed\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/cypreess/snipty", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "snipty", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/snipty/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/snipty/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/cypreess/snipty"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/snipty/0.9.1/", "requires_dist": ["requests (>=2.18)", "termcolor (>=1.1.0)", "PyYAML (>=3.13)"], "requires_python": ">3.6", "summary": "Track snippets use in your codebase with ease", "version": "0.9.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>snipty  <a href=\"https://circleci.com/gh/cypreess/snipty/tree/master\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"CircleCI\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/29356bea4489ecca0fb63309bb6df6d5bea94b97/68747470733a2f2f636972636c6563692e636f6d2f67682f63797072656573732f736e697074792f747265652f6d61737465722e7376673f7374796c653d737667\"></a></h1>\n<p>Snipty is a handy \"like a package manager\" tool that helps you to keep track of code snippets in a codebase.</p>\n<p>The motivation behind Snipty is to make\nsnippets DRY again.

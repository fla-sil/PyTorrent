Anything can be rewritten to\nfit other use cases. The invoiceapp relies on Service, Pet, Customer, and\nAddress. As of now, Address is the only published app. It can be installed with\npip install django-simple-address (address in INSTALLED_APPS). I do not plan on\npublishing the services or pets apps as they are very simple and specific to\nmy current use case. I may publish them bundled with the invoiceapp as it is\ndependent on them.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the project clone the repository or download the project as a zip and\nextract it. Change to the django_invoiceproject\ndirectory, and install the requirements with\n`pip install -r requirements.txt`. Make sure this is done in a virtualenv.\n\nPostfix is used to email customers the invoices.\n\nMake sure that postfix is installed and configured.\n\nFor Ubuntu systems:\n`sudo apt-get install postfix` will install it.\n\nTo configure it:\n`cp /usr/share/postfix/main.cf.debian /etc/postfix/main.cf`\nAdd the following lines to main.cf:\n\n`mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128`\n`mydestination = localhost`\n\nThen, reload this config file: `/etc/init.d/postfix reload`\n\nFor more information checkout the postfix documentation\n\nTest that you can send email from the command line.\nIf this is successfull, you are all done for sending emails\n\nLastly, configure your postgres database.\nThis project assume that you have created a directory called otm unser /etc/\nand created a pass and secret files containing your db user password and your\ndjangi secret key respectively. So, the db user password is under `/etc/otm/pass`\nand the secret key is at `/etc/otm/secret`\nIf you want to change the email host and information, change the configuration\nin the settings.py file\n\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce all the required packaged are installed in virtualenv and postfix setup\nRun: `python manage.py migrate` to create the database tables\nThen create a superuser: `python mange.py createsuperuser`,\nFinally run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`\nThen go to localhost:8000/admin. Login with the super user credentials,\nyou should be able to add your business information, and other goodies.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Fork it!\n2.

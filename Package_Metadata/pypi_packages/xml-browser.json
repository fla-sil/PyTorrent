Representing XML as a directory structure makes it easy to do editing with basic shell tools. Also, some advantage of this approach is that operating on a directory structure makes shell code more comprehensive. For example, if script does ``sed`` on ``root,0/some_element,1/0-text`` then you probably suspect what is going on.\n\nxml_browser is easy to get and run in volatile environment. You could just setup virtualenv and install xml_browser with pip, or even just get the script via http. No need to preinstall anything or download precompiled binaries. xml_browser is pure Python utility and has no external dependencies.\n\nHow to use it?\n==============\n\nThe ``makedir``\n---------------\n\nTake following XML as an example::\n\n    <documentRoot>\n      <a foo=\"bar\" baz=\"bax\">\n        This is a xml_browser demo.\n        <b>yup</b>\n        tail\n      </a>\n      <z />\n    </documentRoot>\n\nLet's say above is the content of `example.xml` file. To create a directory structure based on this file, run::\n\n    xml_browser.py makedir < example.xml\n\nxml_browser reads data from standard input - that way it is easy to pipe results of a command (e.g. ``curl``) directly, without doing too much of a shell magic, like process substitution.\n\nBy running the command, we'll get following dirtree::\n\n    documentRoot,0\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 a,0\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 0-attributes\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 0-text\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 b,0\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 0-tail\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 0-text\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 .tail.ws\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 .text.ws\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 .tail.ws\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 .text.ws\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 .text.ws\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 z,1\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 .tail.ws\n\n    3 directories, 10 files\n\nYou can notice directories corresponding with every element from `example.xml` and some files inside them.\nAll directories have suffixes that are appended to element names as an ordering information. This way we know, that ``<a>`` element goes before ``<z>``. We will discuss ordering in detail later.\n\nWhat about files, why do their names start with ``0-``? The answer is simple - no valid XML tag can start with a number, so it will not clash with any tag name (`text` as a tag name is not that unusual). Tags cannot start with hyphen (``-``) either, but if it was the first character of a filename, then you'd need to use ``--`` in almost every shell command to parse it correctly. Also, ``0-`` is rather easy to type.\n\n`0-attributes` holds information about element attributes in a propfile format, e.g::\n\n    a=1\n    b= 2\n\nNote that there are no quotes. Leading and trailing whitespaces of a value are taken litteraly (no stripping!). Attribute names can have leading and trailing whitespaces but - in contrary to values - they will be stripped. So, following line of `0-attributes`: ``\"   attribute_name    =  value   \"`` will evaluate to ``\"attribute_name\"`` and ``\"  value   \"`` respectively.\n\n`0-text` contains stripped text of element with a newline appended at the end. `0-tail` is almost the same thing, but a tail is a text that goes right *after* element. It's stripped in the same way.\n\nWhen you edit `0-tail` or `0-text` and assemble directory tree to a XML document you can see that leading and trailing whitespaces are preserved. It is possible thanks to `.text.ws` and `.tail.ws` files. They consist of whitespaces and a ``x`` character somewhere between them. This ``x`` serves as a substitution mark - it will be replaced with stripped text from `0-text`/`0-tail`. Usually we don't need to manipulate whitespaces, so they are kept in hidden files.\n\nObtaining data from directory tree\n..................................\n\nMoving around manually doesn't need explaining, I believe. Let's focus a bit on usage in shell scripts.\n\nFor automated tasks ``find``, ``grep`` and globbing are your friends.\n\nThe simplest case is when you know the structure of your XML::\n\n    text_of_b=$(cat documentRoot,0/a,*/b,0/0-text)\n\nThe * is used here just to show, that we can do that this way. Tag names cannot contain commas, so it is used to separate tag name from ordering. Note that * is specified after a comma, so only `a` tag will be matched. if the pattern was ``a*``, then names like ``alaska`` would match as well.\n\nWhat if we want to find every `foo` element in the whole document? Let's try to ``find`` a way::\n\n    find root,0 -type d -name \"foo,*\"\n\nWhat if we want to find every `foo` element with a ``bar`` argument having value ``baz``?::\n\n    find root,0 -type d -name \"foo,*\" -exec grep -q 'bar=baz' {}/0-attributes -print\n\nLet's expand above case and call a compound command for every match::\n\n    find root,0 -type d -name \"foo,*\" -exec grep -q 'bar=baz' {}/0-attributes -print | \\\n    while read -r match; do\n      cat $match/0-text\n      # we could do that in -exec in find or with xargs, but I'm too lazy to come up with a more complex example.\n      # that would fit for a loop. But you see, you can run lots of commands here for every hit!\n    done\n\nWhat if we want to make above the right way?::\n\n    find root,0 -type d -name \"foo,*\" -exec grep -q 'bar=baz' {}/0-attributes -print0 | \\\n    while IFS= read -r -d '' match; do\n      cat \"$match/0-text\"\n    done\n\nWe could do this without ``find`` too, but I consider this less readable - and we need to play around with `IFS`::\n\n        IFS=$'\\n'\n    for match in $(grep -lR 'bar=baz' root,0/* | grep 'foo,[^/]*/0-attributes'); do\n      cat \"$(dirname \"$match\")/0-text\" 2> /dev/null\n    done\n\nThese examples are rather lengthy, but not that hard to construct. xml_browser is intended to be used in shell, so using some ``find``, ``grep`` and some loops is not improper.\n\n\nEditing\n-------\n\nEditing data is similar to reading it. You can use ``sed`` or ``awk`` in commands above, so let's focus on xml_browser specific thing - node ordering.\n\nConsider following::\n\n    <reallySimple>\n      <a/>\n      <a/>\n      <b/>\n      <a/>\n      <c/>\n      <c/>\n      Some tail text\n    </reallySimple>\n\nAs you already know, we'll get following subdirectories inside `reallySimple,0` directory::\n\n    a,0  a,1  b,2  a,3  c,4  c,5\n\nEasy. But how to add a node? It's obvious how to append a node at the end (e.g. ``mkdir new,6``, you may want to move `0-tail` to the new last element). But how to insert it between some existing nodes? Time for some theory.\n\nNumbers at the time of assembling directory structure into a XML document are used solely for ordering, so it does not matter if you have, let's say, `a,0`, `a,1`, `over,2` or something like `a,-100`, `a,4.5` and `over,9000` - the result will be exactly the same. You can specify any float.\n\n*But bash sucks at floats!* - you might say. That's true. You can append more commas and numbers to the dirname. So to insert `middle` element between `a,3` and `c,4`, do::\n\n    mkdir middle,3,1\n\nYou need to know, that ordering operates on tuples of floats. Tuple for `a,0` is ``(0.0,)``, for `middle,3,1` it's ``(3.0, 1.0)``, so if you create a directory named `foo,3,-3` the tuple will be ``(3.0, -3.0)`` and the element will be placed between `a,3` and `middle,3,1` - that's how tuple ordering work, element by element.\n\nxml_browser's ``makedir`` will always generate subsequent integers starting from 0, so it is possible to access elements easily, as the names are predictable. So if you need to read and manipulate data/nodes, do the reading part first, before you will alter ordering.\n\nThe ``assemble``\n----------------\n\nWhen you're done editting, you can assemble the directory tree to a XML document. Just call::\n\n    xml_browser.py assemble documentRoot > result.xml\n\nLike with ``makedir``, result is written on standard output, so you can pipe it to any command or redirect to a file.\n\nPlanned features\n================\n\n- Support for namespaces - ElementTree doesn't handle them correctly.\n- Fancy formatting/generating options\n- Options for creating dirtree - creation mode, handling already existing tree.\n- Waiting for your suggestions!\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nMIT (c) Adrian W\u0142osiak 2016", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/rasguanabana/xml_browser", "keywords": "xml editing", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "xml-browser", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/xml-browser/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/xml-browser/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/rasguanabana/xml_browser"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/xml-browser/0.99.dev2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Edit XML documents as a directory structure", "version": "0.99.dev2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p><strong>xml_browser.py</strong> - Edit XML documents as a directory structure</p>\n<div>\n<p>Note</p>\n<p>This is a demo version.

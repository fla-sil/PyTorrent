The traditional English\nspelling system is afflicted with exceptions and conflicting rules, making\nwriting and reading texts unnecessarily hard.\n\nLytspel is a proposal for reforming the English spelling in order to make\nit strictly follow the alphabetic principle. The alphabetic principle means\nthat there is a predictable relationship between written letters and spoken\nsounds. When you see a written word, you know how to pronounce it (even if\nyou don't know the word itself), and vice versa.\n\nTraditional English spelling (tradspell) deviates from the alphabetic\nprinciple in many ways. The mapping between written and spoken words is\nvery complex and riddled with irregularities and exceptions. Lytspel (for\n\u00ablytwait speling\u00bb or \u2039lightweight spelling\u203a) is a proposal to change this,\nwhile keeping as much visual similarity to tradspell as reasonably\npossible.\n\nLytspel not only creates an unambiguous mapping between the sounds used in\nEnglish and their written representations, it also indicates which syllable\nin each word is the stressed one.\n\nIn addition to the reform proposal, there is a comprehensive dictionary and\na [converter](https://www.lytspel.org/) that translates traditional\nspelling into Lytspel.\n\nHere are two example paragraphs written in Lytspel. The first is [The North\nWind and the\nSun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_North_Wind_and_the_Sun), one of\nAesop's fables that's frequently used as an example in phonetics, while the\nsecond is made up of two nonsense sentences that contain most of the sounds\nof English.\n\n> Dhe North Wind and dhe Sun wur di'spiuting wich wos dhe strongger, wen a\n> traveler caim a'long rapd in a worm cloak. Dhay a'greed dhat dhe won hu\n> furst su'xeeded in maiking dhe traveler taik his cloak of shood bee\n> con'siderd strongger dhan dhe udher. Dhen dhe North Wind blu as hard as\n> hi cood, but dhe mor hi blu dhe mor cloassli did dhe traveler foald his\n> cloak e'round him; and at last dhe North Wind gaiv up dhe a'tempt. Dhen\n> dhe Sun shynd out wormli, and i'meediatli dhe traveler took of his cloak.\n> And so dhe North Wind wos o'blyjd tu con'fess dhat dhe Sun wos dhe\n> strongger ov dhe tuu.\n>\n> Dhat quik baizh fox jumpd in dhe air oaver eech thin dog under a caam\n> autum muun. Look out, y shout, for hi's foild iu yet a'gen, cri'aiting\n> cayoss.\n\nHere are the same paragraphs written in tradspell. Lytspel might look a\nbit unusual at first, but should be easy to get used too. Just try reading\nit out aloud and you'll soon get the hang of it.\n\n> The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a\n> traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the one who\n> first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be\n> considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as hard as\n> he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his\n> cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then\n> the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took off his\n> cloak. And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the\n> stronger of the two.\n>\n> That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog under a calm\n> autumn moon. Look out, I shout, for he's foiled you yet again, creating\n> chaos.\n\n\n## Conventions and Abbreviations\n\nThe following formatting conventions are used in this document:\n\n* \u00abdouble guillemets\u00bb for Lytspel (and spellings that haven't changed)\n* \u2039single guillemets\u203a for traditional spellings\n* /slashes/ for phonetics, written in the\n  [SAMPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMPA_chart_for_English) alphabet\n  (with some slight modifications to make it more suitable for English)\n\nAbbreviations used:\n\n* RP: [Received\n  Pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation), the\n  standard form of English spoken in the United Kingdom, especially in\n  England and Wales\n* GA: [General American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American),\n  English as typically spoken in the United States\n\n\n## The Rules of Lytspel\n\nThe syllable that carries the primary stress in a word is preceded by an\napostrophe, e.g. \u00abdis'cuss, in'telijent, co'miti, cri'ait\u00bb \u2039discuss,\nintelligent, committee, create\u203a. No stress marker is used if a word has\njust one syllable or if the first syllable carries the primary stress, e.g.\n\u00abbig, week, camel, garden\u00bb.\n\nThe short vowels are written as follows:\n\n* \u00aba\u00bb /a/ as in \u00abcat\u00bb\n* \u00abe\u00bb /E/ as in \u00abpen\u00bb\n* \u00abi\u00bb /I/ as in \u00abbig\u00bb\n* \u00abo\u00bb /Q/ as in \u00abdog\u00bb\n* \u00aboo\u00bb /U/ as in \u00abbook\u00bb\n* \u00abu\u00bb /V/ as in \u00abclub\u00bb\n\nThe long vowels and diphthongs are written as follows:\n\n* \u00abaa\u00bb /A/ as in \u00abpaam, faadher\u00bb \u2039palm, father\u203a\n* \u00abai\u00bb /eI/ as in \u00abaim, saint, faiss\u00bb \u2039...face\u203a\n* \u00abau\u00bb /O:/ as in \u00abauther, paus\u00bb \u2039author, pause\u203a\n* \u00abee\u00bb /i:/ as in \u00abtree, teem\u00bb \u2039...team\u203a\n* \u00aboa\u00bb /oU/ as in \u00abboat, hoam\u00bb \u2039...home\u203a\n* \u00aboi\u00bb /OI/ as in \u00aboil, point, a'void\u00bb \u2039...avoid\u203a\n* \u00abou\u00bb /aU/ as in \u00abmouth, doun\u00bb \u2039...down\u203a\n* \u00abuu\u00bb /u:/ as in \u00abmuun, ix'cluud, gruup\u00bb \u2039moon, exclude, group\u203a\n* \u00abiu\u00bb (/yU/ or /ju:/) as in \u00abvaliu, kiut, com'piuter, modiulait\u00bb \u2039value,\n  cute, computer, modulate\u203a\n* The spelling \u00abue\u00bb is used in words that are typically spoken with /yU/ or\n  /ju:/ in RP, with /u:/ or /U/ in GA, e.g. \u00abdue, nuetrel, tuen\u00bb\n  \u2039...neutral, tune\u203a\n* \u00aby\u00bb /aI/ as in \u00abpryss, styl, dry\u00bb \u2039price, style...\u203a\n\nThe consonants are written as follows:\n\n* \u00abb\u00bb /b/ as in \u00abbed\u00bb\n* \u00abch\u00bb /tS/ as in \u00abmuch\u00bb\n* \u00abd\u00bb /d/ as in \u00abdesk\u00bb\n* \u00abdh\u00bb /D/ as in \u00abdhem\u00bb \u2039them\u203a\n* \u00abf\u00bb /f/ as in \u00abfat\u00bb\n* \u00abg\u00bb /g/ as in \u00abbig, garden, gess\u00bb \u2039...guess\u203a\n* \u00abh\u00bb /h/ as in \u00abhot\u00bb\n* \u00abj\u00bb /dZ/ as in \u00abjoy, dijit\u00bb \u2039...digit\u203a\n* \u00abl\u00bb /l/ as in \u00ableg\u00bb\n* \u00abm\u00bb /m/ as in \u00abmad\u00bb\n* \u00abn\u00bb /n/ as in \u00abnow\u00bb\n* \u00abng\u00bb /N/ as in \u00ablong\u00bb\n* \u00abp\u00bb /p/ as in \u00abpop\u00bb\n* \u00abr\u00bb /r/ as in \u00abrun\u00bb\n* \u00absh\u00bb /S/ as in \u00abship\u00bb\n* \u00abt\u00bb /t/ as in \u00abtest\u00bb\n* \u00abth\u00bb /T/ as in \u00abthin\u00bb\n* \u00abv\u00bb /v/ as in \u00abever\u00bb\n* \u00abw\u00bb /w/ as in \u00abwest, wen\u00bb \u2039...when\u203a.

Lytspel generally writes it as \u00abe\u00bb or \u00abu\u00bb.\n* \u00abu\u00bb is used whenever the traditional spelling contains this vowel, e.g.\n  \u00abalbum, nurvuss, su'spend\u00bb \u2039...nervous, suspend\u203a.\n* \u00abe\u00bb is used otherwise, e.g. \u00abcamel, problem, hiden, sentrel\u00bb \u2039...hidden,\n  central\u203a.\n* This means that Lytspel doesn't distinguish between unstressed /V/ as in\n  \u00abfunde'mentl\u00bb \u2039fundamental\u203a or /E/ as in \u00abindex\u00bb and the schwa /@/.\n  However, since the unstressed forms of these vowels sound quite similar\n  to the schwa and there is often no agreement between speakers whether to\n  use one or the other, this shouldn't hurt.\n* A schwa immediately preceding the primarily stressed syllable can also be\n  represented by one of the other three vowel letters (\u00aba, i, o\u00bb, but not\n  \u00aby\u00bb), e.g. \u00aba\u00bb in \u00aba'bout\u00bb \u2039about\u203a, \u00abi\u00bb in \u00abimaji'naition\u00bb \u2039imagination\u203a,\n  \u00abo\u00bb in \u00abcom'piut\u00bb \u2039compute\u203a. The reason for this is that the vowel\n  preceding the stressed syllable is often spoken so quickly that it's hard\n  to decide whether a schwa or one of the short vowels is pronounced and\n  not all speakers will agree on which one to use. For clarity, it's\n  therefore better to stick with the original representation of the vowel\n  in such cases, even if most speakers might reduce it to a schwa.\n  Additionally, the reduced vowel often becomes clearly audible in related\n  words, e.g. while the second \u00abi\u00bb in \u00abimaji'naition\u00bb \u2039imagination\u203a is\n  often reduced to a schwa, in \u00abi'majin\u00bb \u2039imagine\u203a it's clearly audible as\n  /I/.\n* Between some consonant pairs at the end of words, the schwa is omitted in\n  writing; since these pairs never occur *without* an intervening vowel at\n  the end of words, there is no risk of confusion:\n\n  * Final /s@l/ is written \u00abssl\u00bb, e.g. \u00abcounssl, mussl\u00bb \u2039council, muscle\u203a\n  * Final /z@l/ is written \u00absl\u00bb, e.g. \u00abpro'poasl, pusl\u00bb \u2039proposal, puzzle\u203a\n  * The schwa is also omitted between any of /b, p, d, t, f, g, k/ and\n    final /l/, e.g. \u00abflexebl, simpl, midl, hospitl, litl, bafl, singgl,\n    leegl, sta'tisticl, articl\u00bb \u2039flexible, simple, middle, hospital,\n    little, baffle, single, legal, statistical, article\u203a. An exception is\n    the suffix \u00abful\u00bb, which is sometimes spoken with a schwa but remains\n    unchanged for clarity; e.g. \u00abhelpful, meeningful\u00bb \u2039...meaningful\u203a.\n  * Final /z@m/ is written \u00absm\u00bb, e.g. \u00abcriticism, sarcasm\u00bb\n  * The schwa is also omitted between /D/ and final /m/, e.g. \u00abalgeridhm,\n    ridhm\u00bb \u2039algorithm, rhythm\u203a\n\nBefore \u00abr\u00bb, the vowels are spelled as follows:\n\n* \u00abair\u00bb /e@/ as in \u00abpair, shair, vairi'aition\u00bb \u2039...share, variation\u203a\n* \u00abar\u00bb /Ar/ as in \u00abdark, argyument\u00bb \u2039...argument\u203a\n* \u00abarr\u00bb /ar/ as in \u00abcarri, em'barress\u00bb \u2039carry, embarrass\u203a\n* \u00abeer\u00bb /i@/ as in \u00abcheer, yeer\u00bb \u2039...year\u203a. Note: GA speakers often\n  pronounce this in the same way as the \u00abir\u00bb /Ir/ in \u00abmirer\u00bb \u2039mirror\u203a\n  ([mirror\u2013nearer\n  merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_vowel_changes_before_historic_/r/#Mirror%E2%80%93nearer_merger)).\n* \u00aber\u00bb /@`/ as in \u00abnumber, modern\u00bb (r-colored schwa). Note: In RP and other\n  [non-rhotic accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoticity_in_English),\n  this usually sounds like a normal schwa; likewise, \u00abr\u00bb after other vowels\n  is often inaudible or reduced to a schwa.\n* \u00aberr\u00bb /Er/ as in \u00abmerri, errer\u00bb \u2039merry, error\u203a\n* \u00abir\u00bb /Ir/ as in \u00abmirer, iritait\u00bb \u2039mirror, irritate\u203a\n* \u00aboar\u00bb /or/ as in \u00abpoart, ig'noar, keeboard\u00bb \u2039port, ignore, keyboard\u203a\n* \u00abor\u00bb /O:r/ as in \u00abnorth, order, iuniform\u00bb \u2039...uniform\u203a. Note: Most RP\n  speakers pronounce this in the same way as the \u00aboar\u00bb /or/ in \u00abboard\u00bb, but\n  the two sounds are distinguished in GA.\n* \u00aborr\u00bb /Qr/ as in \u00absorri, to'morro\u00bb \u2039sorry, tomorrow\u203a. Note: Most GA\n  speakers pronounce this in the same way as the \u00abor\u00bb /O:r/ in \u00abnorth\u00bb, but\n  the two sounds are distinguished in RP.\n* \u00aboor\u00bb /Ur/ as in \u00abpoor, toor, in'shoorenss\u00bb \u2039...tour, insurance\u203a\n* \u00abiur\u00bb (/ju:r/ or /jUr/) as in \u00abIurep, piur, ob'skiur\u00bb \u2039Europe, pure,\n  obscure\u203a\n* The spelling \u00abuer\u00bb is used in words that are typically spoken with /ju:r/\n  or /jUr/ in RP, with /Ur/ in GA, e.g. \u00abduering, nuerel\u00bb \u2039during, neural\u203a\n* \u00abour\u00bb /aUr/ as in \u00abflour, our\u00bb \u2039flour, our *or* hour\u203a\n* \u00abur\u00bb /3:/ as in \u00abturn, furst, con'surn, obzur'vaition\u00bb \u2039...first,\n  concern, observation\u203a. This sound only occurs before \u00abr\u00bb and can be\n  considered a stronger (and often stressed) variant of the schwa.\n* \u00aburr\u00bb /Vr/ as in \u00abhurri, current\u00bb \u2039hurry...\u203a\n* \u00abyr\u00bb is spoken /aI@`/ at the end of words (e.g. \u00abfyr, in'spyr\u00bb \u2039fire,\n  inspire\u203a), /aIr/ elsewhere (e.g. \u00abvyruss, yreni, spyrel\u00bb \u2039virus, irony,\n  spiral\u203a)\n\nSome vowels are spelled differently at the end of words or before other\nvowels:\n\n* /eI/ is spelled \u00abay\u00bb at the end of words and before other vowels (instead\n  of \u00abai\u00bb), e.g. \u00abplay, holiday, layer, cayoss\u00bb \u2039...chaos\u203a.\n* /aI/ is spelled \u00abai\u00bb before other vowels (instead of \u00aby\u00bb), e.g.\n  \u00abdai'amiter, quaiet, vaielenss, aiern, haierarki, Ha'waii\u00bb \u2039diameter,\n  quiet, violence, iron, hierarchy, Hawaii\u203a. This prevents confusion with\n  the consonant /j/ (as in \u00abyet\u00bb) which is also spelled \u00aby\u00bb but only occurs\n  before vowels. There is no risk of confusion with /eI/ (as in \u00abaim,\n  layer\u00bb) which is always spelled \u00abay\u00bb in this position.\n* The same spelling is used if /aI/ occurs after a vowel at the end of a\n  word, e.g. \u00abraidiai\u00bb \u2039radii\u203a.\n* /O:/ is spelled \u00abaw\u00bb at the end of words and before other vowels (instead\n  of \u00abau\u00bb), e.g. \u00ablaw, drawing\u00bb.\n* Final /E/ is spelled \u00abeh\u00bb (instead of \u00abe\u00bb), e.g. \u00abeh, Yaaweh\u00bb\n  \u2039...Yahweh\u203a.\n* Unstressed /i:/ is spelled \u00abi\u00bb at the end of words and before other\n  vowels (instead of \u00abee\u00bb), e.g. \u00abfansi, ne'ceciti, vidio, cri'aition\u00bb\n  \u2039fancy, necessity, video, creation\u203a. This means that Lytspel cannot\n  distinguish between unstressed /i:/ and unstressed /I/ (as in \u00abbig\u00bb) in\n  these positions, but that shouldn't hurt, as /I/ is rarely used in these\n  positions and dictionaries often disagree on which of these sounds to use\n  anyway.\n* This spelling is also used in the personal pronouns ending in /i:/ (as\n  these are often less stressed than other words in a sentence): \u00abhi, shi,\n  wi, mi\u00bb \u2039he, she, we, me\u203a. And it's used at the end of prefixes such as\n  \u00abanti, semi\u00bb (spoken with /i:/ by many speakers, with /aI/ by others) as\n  well as \u00abdi, pri, ri\u00bb \u2039de, pre, re\u203a (even if the prefix is stressed),\n  e.g. \u00abanti'aircraft, anti'soashel; semi'fynel, semiaute'matic; di'graid,\n  di'bug; prima'choor, pri'requisit; ri'act, ripro'duess\u00bb \u2039antiaircraft,\n  antisocial; semifinal, semiautomatic; degrade, debug; premature,\n  prerequisite; react, reproduce\u203a.\n* /oU/ is spelled \u00abo\u00bb at the end of words and before other vowels (instead\n  of \u00aboa\u00bb), e.g. \u00abyelo, zeero, co'operait, po'etic, sho\u00bb \u2039yellow, zero,\n  cooperate, poetic, show\u203a. This poses little risk of confusion, as /Q/ (as\n  in \u00abdog\u00bb) occurs rarely or never before other vowels. (Final /Q/ could be\n  written \u00aboh\u00bb, but in practice it never seems to occur.)\n* This spelling is also used at the end of prefixes such as \u00abastro, baio,\n  endo, ethno, ferro, fyto, galveno, hetero, hypo, imyuno, jio, keemo,\n  macro, mycro, nio, nuemo, nuero, palio, soacio, spectro, suudo, thurmo,\n  ysso\u00bb \u2039astro, bio, endo, ethno, ferro, phyto, galvano, hetero, hypo,\n  immuno, geo, chemo, macro, micro, neo, pneumo, neuro, paleo, socio,\n  spectro, pseudo, thermo, iso\u203a, e.g. \u00abbaio'kemistri, ethno'sentric,\n  hetero'secshual, imyunodi'fishenssi, jio'fisicl, keemo'therrepi,\n  mycrowaiv, nio'classic, nuero'surjeri, suudo'saienss, thurmody'namics\u00bb\n  \u2039biochemistry, ethnocentric, heterosexual, immunodeficiency, geophysical,\n  chemotherapy, microwave, neoclassic, neurosurgery, pseudoscience,\n  thermodynamics\u203a.\n* /OI/ is spelled \u00aboy\u00bb at the end of words and before other vowels (instead\n  of \u00aboi\u00bb), e.g. \u00abboy, en'joy, royel\u00bb \u2039...enjoy, royal\u203a.\n* /aU/ is spelled \u00abow\u00bb at the end of words and before other vowels (instead\n  of \u00abou\u00bb), e.g. \u00abnow, power, a'low\u00bb \u2039...allow\u203a.\n* Final /V/ is spelled \u00abuh\u00bb (instead of \u00abu\u00bb), e.g. \u00abhuh\u00bb.\n* /u:/ is spelled \u00abu\u00bb at the end of words and before other vowels (instead\n  of \u00abuu\u00bb), e.g. \u00abclu, ishu, sichu'aition\u00bb \u2039clue, issue, situation\u203a. This\n  poses little risk of confusion, as /V/ (as in \u00abbus\u00bb) occurs rarely or\n  never before other vowels.\n* Final schwa /@/ is spelled \u00aba\u00bb (instead of \u00abe\u00bb or \u00abu\u00bb), e.g. \u00abextra,\n  daita\u00bb \u2039...data\u203a. (Should unstressed /a/ (as in \u00abcat\u00bb) occur at the end\n  of words, it could be written \u00abah\u00bb, but in practice it never seems to\n  occur.)\n* Schwa /@/ before other vowels is always spelled \u00abe\u00bb (never \u00abu\u00bb) to\n  prevent confusion with /u:/ (spelled \u00abu\u00bb in this position). Schwa in this\n  position is very rare.\n\nSpellings involving several sounds:\n\n* The vowel combination /i:@/ or /I@/ is written \u00abia\u00bb, e.g. \u00abmi'steeriass,\n  ma'teerial, meediam, obviass, vairiabl, airia, i'meediat\u00bb \u2039mysterious,\n  material, medium, obvious, variable, area, immediate\u203a. In a few words,\n  \u00abia\u00bb instead represents /i:a/, e.g. \u00aben'thuesiasm, zoadiac\u00bb \u2039enthusiasm,\n  zodiac\u203a (this distinction is not represented in writing).\n* The r-colored vowel combination /i:@`/ is written \u00abier\u00bb, e.g. \u00abthieri\u00bb\n  \u2039theory\u203a.\n* The vowel combination /oU@/ is written \u00aboe\u00bb, e.g. \u00abboe, coe'lition,\n  ys'socroess\u00bb \u2039boa, coalition, isochroous\u203a. In a few words, \u00aboe\u00bb instead\n  represents /oUE/, e.g. \u00abfloem\u00bb \u2039phloem\u203a (this distinction is not\n  represented in writing).\n* The vowel combination /u:@/ or /U@/ is written \u00abua\u00bb, e.g. \u00abacchual,\n  indi'vijual, influanss, soo'purfluass, crual\u00bb \u2039actual, individual,\n  influence, superfluous, cruel\u203a. In a few words, \u00abua\u00bb instead represents\n  /u:a/, e.g. \u00abbivuac\u00bb \u2039bivouac\u203a (this distinction is not represented in\n  writing).\n* Likewise, /ju:@/ and /jU@/ are written \u00abiua\u00bb, e.g. \u00abam'bigiuass, maniual\u00bb\n  \u2039ambiguous, manual\u203a.\n* The consonant combination /kw/ is written \u00abqu\u00bb, e.g. \u00abquit, ri'quest\u00bb\n  \u2039...request\u203a; the letter \u00abq\u00bb only occurs in this combination.\n* The consonant combination /ks/ is written \u00abx\u00bb, e.g. \u00abmix, next,\n  ix'plicit, axident\u00bb \u2039...explicit, accident\u203a.\n* Since \u00abng\u00bb represents the single sound /N/ (as in \u00ablong\u00bb), the sound\n  combination /ng/ is written \u00abn'g\u00bb if a stress marker is needed in this\n  position (e.g. \u00aben'gaij, in'grain\u00bb \u2039engage, ingrain\u203a), \u00abnng\u00bb otherwise\n  (e.g. \u00abcairnngorm, martenngail\u00bb \u2039cairngorm, martingale\u203a).\n* Before /k/, \u00abn\u00bb is pronounced /N/ rather then /n/ (e.g. \u00abbank, tranquil,\n  dis'tinct, bron'kytiss\u00bb \u2039...distinct, bronchitis\u203a), except if \u00abn\u00bb and /k/\n  belong to different parts of a compound (e.g. \u00abmankynd, raincoat\u00bb\n  \u2039mankind...\u203a) or if a word starts with any of \u00abcon, en, in, non, un\u00bb\n  followed by a /k/ sound (e.g. \u00abcon'cluusion, en'counter, in'compitent,\n  increess *or* in'creess, noncon'formist, un'cleer\u00bb \u2039conclusion,\n  encounter, incompetent, increase, nonconformist, unclear\u203a).\n* If /Nk/ is spoken where the preceding rule suggests /nk/, the /N/ is\n  written \u00abng\u00bb, e.g. \u00abcongker, ingk, ingcling, ungcl, ungction\u00bb \u2039conker\n  *or* conquer, ink, inkling, uncle, unction\u203a. Some words starting with\n  \u00abcon\u00bb or \u00abin\u00bb are pronounced with /n/ by some speakers, with /N/ by\n  others; in such cases, Lytspel uses \u00abn\u00bb for simplicity, e.g. \u00abconquest,\n  increment, concreet, inqui'sition\u00bb \u2039...concrete, inquisition\u203a.\n* /n/ is written \u00abnn\u00bb if it occurs before /k/ in places where \u00abn\u00bb would be\n  spoken /N/, e.g. \u00abcanncan, melenncoli, noamennclaicher\u00bb \u2039cancan,\n  melancholy, nomenclature\u203a.\n\nSome sound combinations are written in a special way if they occur at the\nend of words:\n\n* Final /O:l/ is written \u00aball\u00bb, e.g. \u00abball, in'stall\u00bb \u2039...install\u203a. This\n  spelling is preserved in derived words, e.g. \u00abwalls, calling,\n  in'stallment\u00bb \u2039...installment\u203a.\n* Final /S@n/ is written \u00abtion\u00bb, e.g. \u00abrecog'nition, obzur'vaition,\n  section, per'mition, moation, oation, miu'sition\u00bb \u2039recognition,\n  observation, section, permission, motion, ocean, musician\u203a.\n* Final /Z@n/ is written \u00absion\u00bb, e.g. \u00abvision, con'fiusion, i'quaision\u00bb\n  \u2039...confusion, equation\u203a.\n* The \u00abtion\u00bb and \u00absion\u00bb spellings aren't used in words that are derived by\n  appending \u00abn\u00bb or \u00aben\u00bb to another word, e.g. \u00abashen, freshen, Rushan,\n  Mela'neezhan\u00bb \u2039ashen, freshen, Russian, Melanesian\u203a from \u00abash, fresh,\n  Rusha, Mela'neezha\u00bb \u2039ash, fresh, Russia, Melanesia\u203a.\n* The \u00abtion\u00bb and \u00absion\u00bb spellings are preserved in derived words (e.g.\n  \u00abri'laitionship, tra'ditionel, o'caisionel\u00bb \u2039relationship, traditional,\n  occasional\u203a), even if the derived form is irregular (e.g. \u00abnationel\u00bb\n  \u2039national\u203a from \u00abnaition\u00bb \u2039nation\u203a).\n\nDisambiguating multigraphs (sequences of multiple characters representing a\nsingle sound or an r-colored vowel):\n\n* Spellings involving digraphs (such as \u00abch, sh, ss, ai, oa, oy, ur\u00bb) and\n  trigraphs (such as \u00abarr, eer\u00bb) are generally read from left to right: the\n  first letter sequence that *can* be read as a multigraph *should* be read\n  as such; e.g. \u00abdueel\u00bb \u2039dual *or* duel\u203a is read as \u00abd-ue-e-l\u00bb (/dj'u:@l/\n  or /d'u:@l/), \u00ablayer\u00bb is read as \u00abl-ay-er\u00bb (/l'eI@`/).\n* But the trigraphs \u00abiai, uai\u00bb are read as \u00abi\u00bb /i:/ or \u00abu\u00bb /u:/ followed by\n  \u00abai\u00bb (spoken /aI/ at the end of words, /eI/ otherwise), e.g.\n  \u00aba'preeshiait, flucchuait, raidiai\u00bb \u2039appreciate, fluctuate, radii\u203a.\n* Since final /OI/ is spelled \u00aboy\u00bb, final \u00aboi\u00bb unambiguously represents the\n  two vowels /oUi:/. This combination occasionally occurs in derived words,\n  e.g. \u00abshoi\u00bb \u2039showy\u203a from \u00absho\u00bb \u2039show\u203a.\n* \u00aboic\u00bb at the end of words is always spoken /oUIk/ (two separate vowels),\n  e.g. \u00abhi'roic, stoic\u00bb \u2039heroic...\u203a.\n* Double \u00abrr\u00bb always forms a trigraph with the vowel to its left, e.g.\n  \u00abFebruerri\u00bb \u2039February\u203a is read as \u00abF-e-b-r-u-err-i\u00bb.\n* In cases where the previous rules would lead to a misreading, Lytspel\n  recommends inserting a hyphen to indicate the correct reading, e.g.\n  \u00abCro-at, po-it, co-in'syd, co-ope'raition, su-er, Lu-eesi'ana,\n  Aalts-hymer, sheeps-hed\u00bb \u2039Croat, poet, coincide, cooperation, sewer,\n  Louisiana, Alzheimer, sheepshead\u203a.\n* Those who prefer a more classical form may omit the hyphen between two\n  vowels and place a diaeresis over the second one, e.g. \u00abCro\u00e4t, po\u00eft,\n  co\u00efn'syd, co\u00f6pe'raition, Lu\u00ebesi'ana\u00bb.\n* Multigraphs ending in \u00abr\u00bb may be interrupted by a stress marker before\n  the final \u00abr\u00bb and are still read as multigraphs, e.g. \u00abco-ope'raition,\n  hor'rific\u00bb \u2039cooperation, horrific\u203a. The multigraph \u00abss\u00bb is broken in the\n  middle, e.g. \u00abas'sumption\u00bb \u2039assumption\u203a.\n* Other multigraphs are never interrupted by a stress marker, hence in such\n  cases a marker has the same effect as a hyphen: it indicates that the\n  letters to the left and to the right of it should be read in isolation,\n  e.g. \u00abco'operait\u00bb \u2039cooperate\u203a.\n* In particular, the vowel multigraphs \u00abaw, ay, ow, oy\u00bb /O:, eI, aU, OI/\n  are *not* broken in the rare cases where a stressed vowel follows, to\n  prevent misreadings. Contrast \u00abdraw'ee\u00bb \u2039drawee\u203a with \u00aba'waik\u00bb \u2039awake\u203a,\n  \u00abcay'otic\u00bb \u2039chaotic\u203a with  \u00abga'yaal\u00bb \u2039gayal\u203a.\n* Hyphens are generally not inserted between a base word and a suffix, e.g.\n  \u00abtruer\u00bb from \u00abtru\u00bb \u2039true\u203a.\n* After a prefix or the first part of a compound, a hyphen is only inserted\n  if the last letter of the first part and the first letter of the second\n  part would otherwise form one of the combinations \u00aboa, oi, oo, ou, iu\u00bb\n  (each of which represents a single vowel), e.g. \u00abthro-away, co-ig'zist,\n  blo-out, poli-un'sacheraited\u00bb \u2039throwaway, coexist, blowout,\n  polyunsaturated\u203a. In other cases, no hyphens are inserted, e.g.\n  \u00abshorthand\u00bb.\n* Writers may, of course, insert a hyphen (or a diaeresis) between the\n  parts of an affixed or compound word whenever they consider such a visual\n  separator helpful to prevent misreadings or confusion.\n\nRules for derived and related words:\n\n* In front of suffixes starting with \u00abe, i, y\u00bb, final \u00abc\u00bb is changed to\n  \u00abk\u00bb, e.g. \u00abtrafiking\u00bb \u2039trafficking\u203a from \u00abtrafic\u00bb \u2039traffic\u203a.\n* Final \u00abc\u00bb remains unchanged in front of such suffixes if its\n  pronunciation changes from /k/ to /s/, e.g. \u00abpublicist, publicys\u00bb\n  \u2039...publicize\u203a from \u00abpublic\u00bb.\n* In front of suffixes consisting in a single consonant (\u00abd, n, s\u00bb), final\n  \u00abi\u00bb (unstressed /i:/) becomes \u00abie\u00bb to mark it as long, e.g. \u00abstudied\u00bb\n  from \u00abstudi\u00bb \u2039study\u203a, \u00abvairies\u00bb \u2039varies\u203a from \u00abvairi\u00bb \u2039vary\u203a. Otherwise\n  forms such as \"studid\" would look like \u00absplendid\u00bb, but be spoken quite\n  differently.\n* To prevent misreadings, final \u00abo\u00bb /oU/ is changed back to \u00aboa\u00bb and final\n  \u00abu\u00bb /u:/ to \u00abuu\u00bb in front of the same suffixes, e.g. \u00abfoload\u00bb \u2039followed\u203a\n  from \u00abfolo\u00bb \u2039follow\u203a, \u00abchuud\u00bb \u2039chewed\u203a from \u00abchu\u00bb \u2039chew\u203a, \u00abthroan\u00bb\n  \u2039thrown\u203a from \u00abthro\u00bb \u2039throw\u203a, \u00abstruun\u00bb \u2039strewn\u203a from \u00abstru\u00bb \u2039strew\u203a,\n  \u00abpo'taitoas\u00bb \u2039potatoes\u203a from \u00abpo'taito\u00bb \u2039potato\u203a, \u00abshuus\u00bb \u2039shoes\u203a from\n  \u00abshu\u00bb \u2039shoe\u203a.\n* A schwa /@/ at the start of suffixes is written as \u00aba\u00bb if the base word\n  ends in /i:/ or /u:/, e.g. \u00abeesiast\u00bb \u2039easiest\u203a from \u00abeesi\u00bb \u2039easy\u203a,\n  \u00abvairiabl\u00bb \u2039variable\u203a from \u00abvairi\u00bb \u2039vary\u203a, \u00abduabl\u00bb \u2039doable\u203a from \u00abdu\u00bb\n  \u2039do\u203a, \u00aba'greeabl\u00bb \u2039agreeable\u203a from \u00aba'gree\u00bb \u2039agree\u203a. This ensures\n  consistency with the combined spellings \u00abia\u00bb and \u00abua\u00bb used elsewhere (see\n  above) and prevents confusion with \u00abie\u00bb in words such as \u00abstudied\u00bb.

The past tense of irregular verbs\n  is spelled as it's spoken, e.g. \u00abkept\u00bb from \u00abkeep\u00bb.\n* While in tradspell a noun and a related verb are often written the same\n  even if spoken differently, in Lytspel the spelling reflects the actual\n  pronunciation, e.g. \u00aba suspect, to su'spect; a record, to ri'cord; a\n  houss, to hous\u00bb \u2039a suspect, to suspect; a record, to record; a house, to\n  house\u203a.\n* Normally Lytspel doesn't use double consonants, except in those cases\n  where a double consonant is spoken differently than a single one (e.g.\n  \u00abss\u00bb spoken /s/ in certain contexts where \u00abs\u00bb is spoken /z/). However,\n  double consonants can also occur if they belong to different parts of a\n  compound or if one belongs to a prefix or suffix and the other to the\n  base word, e.g. \u00abtoatlli, suuper'reejenel, un'nececerri\u00bb \u2039totally,\n  superregional, unnecessary\u203a.\n* Unstressed final /Iks/ traditionally written \u2039ics\u203a is treated as if it is\n  a plural (and hence written \u00abics\u00bb) even if the corresponding singular\n  form (ending in /Ik/) is unknown or rarely used, e.g. \u00abastro'fisics,\n  daia'netics\u00bb \u2039astrophysics, dianetics\u203a. This is for consistency with the\n  many cases where \u00abics\u00bb /Iks/ indeed marks a plural or quasi-plural, e.g.\n  \u00abilec'tronics\u00bb \u2039electronics\u203a from \u00abilec'tronic\u00bb \u2039electronic\u203a.\n* For consistency with forms derived by appending \u00abli\u00bb \u2039ly\u203a to words ending\n  in \u00abcl\u00bb \u2039cal\u203a (e.g. \u00abpracticlli\u00bb \u2039practically\u203a from \u00abpracticl\u00bb\n  \u2039practical\u203a), all forms derived by appending \u2039ally\u203a (pronounced /@li:/ or\n  /li:/) to words ending in \u00abc\u00ab are written \u00abclli\u00bb, e.g. \u00abbaissiclli\u00bb\n  \u2039basically\u203a from \u00abbaissic\u00bb \u2039basic\u203a, \u00abspe'cificlli\u00bb \u2039specifically\u203a from\n  \u00abspe'cific\u00bb \u2039specific\u203a.\n\nIrregular words:\n\n* The vowels in the articles \u00abdhe, a, an\u00bb \u2039the...\u203a retain their traditional\n  spelling.\n* \u00abey\u00bb \u2039eye\u203a is written irregularly to distinguish it from \u00aby\u00bb \u2039I\u203a and for\n  easier recognition in compounds such as \u00abfishey\u00bb \u2039fisheye\u203a.\n* \u00abnoa\u00bb \u2039know\u203a is written somewhat irregularly to distinguish it from \u00abno\u00bb.\n* \u00aboa\u00bb \u2039owe\u203a is written somewhat irregularly since a verb with just one\n  letter could be confusing (and also to distinguish it from the\n  interjection \u00abo\u00bb \u2039oh\u203a).\n* \u00abtuu\u00bb \u2039too *or* two\u203a is written somewhat irregularly to distinguish it\n  from \u00abtu\u00bb \u2039to\u203a.\n\nUses of the apostrophe:\n\n* Lytspel uses an apostrophe to mark the syllable that carries the main\n  stress (provided it's not the first one). Additionally, as in tradspell,\n  apostrophes are used to mark genitives and contractions.\n* \u00ab's\u00bb is used for the genitive (as in tradspell) and for contractions with\n  \u00abis, has\u00bb, e.g. \u00abLinda's sister, dhair's\u00bb \u2039...there's\u203a.\n* \u00ab'd\u00bb is used for contractions with \u00abhad, wood, shood\u00bb \u2039...would, should\u203a,\n  e.g. \u00abit'd\u00bb.\n* \u00ab'l\u00bb \u2039'll\u203a is used for contractions with \u00abwil, shal\u00bb \u2039will, shall\u203a, e.g.\n  \u00abshi'l\u00bb \u2039she'll\u203a.\n* The contraction \u00aby'm\u00bb \u2039I'm\u203a is short for \u00aby am\u00bb \u2039I am\u203a.\n* \u00ab'r\u00bb \u2039're\u203a is used for contractions with \u00abar\u00bb \u2039are\u203a, e.g. \u00abdhay'r\u00bb\n  \u2039they're\u203a.\n* \u00ab'v\u00bb \u2039've\u203a is used for contractions with \u00abhav\u00bb \u2039have\u203a, e.g. \u00abiu'v\u00bb\n  \u2039you've\u203a.\n* \u00abn't\u00bb is used for contractions with \u00abnot\u00bb where the /Q/ is not spoken,\n  e.g. \u00abshoodn't\u00bb \u2039shouldn't\u203a. If the first word ends in \u00abn\u00bb, the second\n  \u00abn\u00bb is omitted: \u00abcan't\u00bb from \u00abcan not\u00bb. In a few cases, the first word\n  may be further contracted: \u00abain't\u00bb for one of \u00abam/is/ar/has/hav not\u00bb\n  \u2039am/is/are/has/have not\u203a, \u00abhan't\u00bb for \u00abhas/hav not\u00bb \u2039has/have not\u203a,\n  \u00abshan't\u00bb for \u00abshal not\u00bb \u2039shall not\u203a, \u00abwoan't\u00bb \u2039won't\u203a for \u00abwil not\u00bb. The\n  pronunciations of \u00abdoan't\u00bb \u2039don't\u203a and \u00abmusn't\u00bb \u2039mustn't\u203a differ from the\n  uncontracted forms, and the spelling reflects this.\n* In all these cases, the genitive or contraction marker is inserted after\n  the last vowel and hence cannot be confused with a stress marker.\n* In other cases, a traditional contraction marker doubles as a stress\n  marker in Lytspel, e.g. \u00abo'clok\u00bb \u2039o'clock\u203a for \u00abov dhe clok\u00bb \u2039of the\n  clock\u203a.\n* This also applies to Irish names starting with \u00abO'\u00bb, e.g. \u00abO'Coner,\n  O'Neel\u00bb \u2039O'Connor, O'Neil\u203a. The capitalized \u00abO'\u00bb is spoken /oU/ (as in\n  \u00abboat\u00bb). Of course, proper names can be spelled as their owners prefer\n  it, so many names won't be regularized according to the Lytspel rules.\n* In the nonstandard expression \u2039y'all\u203a, short for \u00abiu all\u00bb \u2039you all\u203a, the\n  contraction marker is placed in front of the stressed vowel, marking the\n  original word boundary.\n* In a few cases, words are contracted by eliminating a syllable or a sound\n  for brevity or for literary effect. In these cases, Lytspel recommends\n  placing a contraction marker before the final consonant in monosyllabic\n  words (\u00abai'r, nai'r, oa'r, ee'n, ma'm, bru'r\u00bb \u2039e'er, ne'er, o'er, e'en,\n  ma'am, br'er\u203a from \u00abever, never, oaver, eeven, madem, brudher\u00bb \u2039...,\n  over, even, madam, brother\u203a) and just using a regular stress marker\n  otherwise (\u00abwair'air, wairso'air, nor'eester\u00bb \u2039where'er, wheresoe'er,\n  nor'easter\u203a from \u00abwair'ever, wairso'ever, north'eester\u00bb \u2039wherever,\n  wheresoever, northeaster\u203a).\n\nInner capitalization instead of a stress marker:\n\n* Various Scottish and Irish names start with \u2039Mc\u203a or \u2039Mac\u203a /m@k/ followed\n  by a capitalized and stressed second syllable. Lytspel recommends writing\n  these names with \u00abMc\u00bb and omitting the stress marker, e.g. \u00abMcAdem,\n  McDonel\u00bb \u2039McAdam, McDonnell\u203a. If the stressed syllable starts with a /k/\n  sound, that letter is capitalized (and repeated after the initial \u00abMc\u00bb),\n  e.g. \u00abMcCarti, McKee, McQueen\u00bb \u2039McCarty...\u203a. If any other syllable is\n  stressed, Lytspel recommend writing the word regularly without inner\n  capitalization, e.g. \u00abMakintosh\u00bb \u2039Macintosh *or* McIntosh\u203a.\n\n\n## International Pronunciation Differences\n\nAs an international language, English is currently written and spoken\nsomewhat differently in various parts of the world.\n\nOn the one hand, by using a phonetic spelling, Lytspel eliminates most\ndifferences that traditionally exist between written British (BE) and\nAmerican English (AE), e.g. \u00abculer, senter, orgenys, anelys, lycenss,\ncatalog, aijing, program, chek, gray\u00bb \u2039colour/color, centre/center,\norganise/organize, analyse/analyze, licence/license, catalogue/catalog,\nageing/aging, programme/program, cheque/check, grey/gray\u203a.\n\nOn the other hand, tailoring Lytspel to faithfully represent just one\nregional variety would cause many deviations from the alphabetic principle\nfor everyone else. And creating different variants of Lytspel each fitting\njust one regional variety would introduce even larger differences between\ndifferent regional varieties of written English than traditionally exist\nbetween BE and AE.\n\nInstead of going down either of theses routes, Lytspel had been designed as\nsome kind of \"global compromise.\" It aims to keep the phonetic principle\nreasonably intact for all varieties of spoken English, and particularly for\nRP (since the English language originates in England) and GA (since the\nUnited States are the country with the highest number of native English\nspeakers).\n\nVarious details of the Lytspel spellings have already been motivated as\nrepresenting sound distinctions that exist either in RP or in GA, and the\n\u00abue\u00bb and \u00abuer\u00bb spellings are a compromise used in words spoken differently\nin RP and GA. But such compromises are not almost possible without making\nthe written language extremely complex and unwieldy. In other cases,\nLytspel therefore resolves differences between RP and GA by choosing one\nspelling -- often the one that keeps the written language more similar to\ntradspell or else the shorter one:\n\n* /a/ (\u00aba\u00bb) is preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /a/ or\n  /A/, e.g. \u00ablast, guulash\u00bb \u2039...goulash\u203a.\n* /a/ is also preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /a/ or\n  /eI/, e.g. \u00abpatent, patriat\u00bb \u2039...patriot\u203a.\n* /a/ is also preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /a/ or /Q/,\n  e.g. \u00abrath\u00bb \u2039wrath\u203a.\n* /A/ (\u00abaa)\u00bb is preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /A/ or\n  /eI/, e.g. \u00abto'maato, swaadh\u00bb \u2039tomato, swathe\u203a.\n* /aI/ (\u00aby\u00bb, \u00abai\u00bb before vowels) is preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken\n  as either /aI/ or /i:/, e.g. \u00abnydher, filistyn\u00bb \u2039neither, philistine\u203a.\n* /E/ (\u00abe)\u00bb is preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /E/ or\n  /eI/, e.g. \u00aba'gen\u00bb \u2039again\u203a.\n* /E/ is also preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /E/ or\n  /i:/, e.g. \u00ablezher, predececer\u00bb \u2039leisure, predecessor\u203a.\n* /I/ (\u00abi\u00bb) is preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /I/ or\n  /aI/, e.g. \u00abcristelin, di'rect, orgeni'saition\u00bb \u2039crystalline, direct,\n  organization\u203a.\n* /I/ is also preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /I/ or /i:/\n  (e.g. \u00abafro'disiac\u00bb \u2039aphrodisiac\u203a), unless its original representation is\n  \u2039ee\u203a (e.g. \u00abbeen\u00bb).\n* /i:/ (\u00abee\u00bb, \u00abi\u00bb before vowels) is preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken\n  as either /i:/ or /eI/, e.g. \u00abbeeta, ga'seebo, Izrial\u00bb \u2039beta, gazebo,\n  Israel\u203a.\n* /Q/ (\u00abo\u00bb) is preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /Q/ or\n  /O:/, e.g. \u00abalkehol, cloth\u00bb \u2039alcohol...\u203a.\n* /Q/ is also preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /Q/ or\n  /oU/, e.g. \u00abprocess, shon\u00bb \u2039...shone\u203a.\n* /Q/ is also preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /Q/ or /V/,\n  e.g. \u00abfrom, wot, a'complish\u00bb \u2039...what, accomplish\u203a.\n* /oU/ (\u00aboa\u00bb) is preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /oU/ or\n  /O:/, e.g. \u00absloath\u00bb \u2039sloth\u203a.\n* /U/ (\u00aboo\u00bb) is preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /U/ or\n  /u:/, e.g. \u00abcoocu, hoof\u00bb \u2039cuckoo...\u203a.\n* /Ir/ (\u00abir\u00bb) is preferred if an r-colored vowel is commonly spoken as\n  either /Ir/ or /3:/, e.g. \u00absquirel\u00bb \u2039squirrel\u203a.\n* /3:/ (\u00abur\u00bb) is preferred if an r-colored vowel is commonly spoken as\n  either /3:/ or /A(r)/, e.g. \u00abclurk, durbi\u00bb \u2039clerk, derby\u203a.\n* /w/ (\u00abw\u00bb) is preferred if a sound preceding a vowel is commonly spoken as\n  either /w/ or one of /ju:/ or /jU/, e.g. \u00abjagwar\u00bb \u2039jaguar\u203a.\n* If a vowel is spoken as a schwa or omitted altogether in some regions, as\n  /aI/ elsewhere, Lytspel generally uses \u00abi\u00bb /I/ as a compromise, e.g.\n  \u00abajil, vursetil\u00bb, \u2039agile, versatile\u203a.\n* Otherwise, if a vowel is spoken with a full vowel sound in some regions,\n  while reduced to a schwa or omitted altogether elsewhere, Lytspel tends\n  to write the full version, e.g. \u00abcategoari, inevaitiv, militerri,\n  poartrait, prymerri, python, roazmairi, testimoani\u00bb \u2039category,\n  innovative, military, portrait, primary, python, rosemary, testimony\u203a.\n* /z/ (\u00abs\u00bb or \u00abz\u00bb, depending on position) is preferred if a consonant is\n  commonly spoken as either /z/ or /s/, e.g. \u00abi'rais, venisen, talizmen\u00bb\n  \u2039erase, venison, talisman\u203a.\n* If a consonant is commonly spoken as either /Z/ or /S/, final \u00absion\u00bb\n  /Z@n/ is preserved if it's already the traditional ending (e.g.\n  \u00abcon'vursion\u00bb \u2039conversion\u203a), otherwise /S/ (usually \u00absh\u00bb) is preferred,\n  e.g. \u00abAisha, i'raisher\u00bb \u2039Asia, erasure\u203a.\n* /si:/ (depending on position, but often \u00abci\u00bb) is preferred if a sequence\n  is commonly spoken as either /si:/ or /S/, e.g. \u00abhecian, om'niciant\u00bb\n  \u2039hessian, omniscient\u203a.\n* /zi:/ (depending on position, but often \u00absi\u00bb) is preferred if a sequence\n  is commonly spoken as either /zi:/ or /Z/, e.g. \u00abhoasieri, Ma'laisia\u00bb\n  \u2039hosiery, Malaysia\u203a.\n* /ti:/ (\u00abti\u00bb before vowels) is preferred if a sequence is commonly spoken\n  as either /ti:/ or as one of /S, Si:, tS, tSi:/, e.g. \u00absentiant,\n  con'sortiam, bestial, bestierri\u00bb \u2039sentient, consortium, bestial,\n  bestiary\u203a.\n\nIf a letter is commonly either spoken or silent, Lytspel tends to preserve\nit, e.g. \u00abplatinum, trait\u00bb (not \"platnum, tray\").\n\nIf speakers in different regions tend to stress different syllables,\nLytspel usually places the stress early rather than late, e.g. \u00aban adress,\ndecaid, truncait, weekend\u00bb \u2039an address, decade, truncate...\u203a. But in the\ncase of originally foreign words where a late stress placement corresponds\nto the pronunciation in the original language, it is often preserved, e.g.\n\u00abca'feen, expoa'say\u00bb \u2039caffeine, expos\u00e9\u203a.\n\nOther differences are usually unique to just one or very few words. In such\ncases, Lytspel generally prefers the pronunciation that is more similar to\nthe traditional written form, e.g. \u00abcordial, figer, shediul\u00bb \u2039...figure,\nschedule\u203a (rather than \"corjel, figyer, skejuul\").\n\nIn a few cases, one pronunciation is preferred because it is more similar\nto that of a closely related word, e.g. \u00abpryveci\u00bb \u2039privacy\u203a from \u00abpryvet\u00bb\n\u2039private\u203a (rather than \"priveci\").\n\n\n## Limitations of the Current Dictionary\n\nThe Lytspel dictionary, as currently published, can distinguish between\nwords traditionally written the same but pronounced differently\n(heteronyms) as long as their grammatical role in a sentence is different\n-- one is a noun, while the other is a verb, for example. This allows\ndistinguishing the verb \u00abcloas\u00bb \u2039close\u203a from the adjective \u00abcloass\u00bb, the\nnoun \u00abobject\u00bb from the verb \u00abob'ject\u00bb, etc. (\u00abDhay wur tu cloass to dhe\ndoar to cloas it.\u00bb \u2039They were too close to the door to close it.\u203a / \u00abY did\nnot ob'ject to dhe object.\u00bb \u2039I did not object to the object.\u203a)\n\nHowever, heteronyms are currently only disambiguated by their grammatical\nrole (commonly known as *part of speech,* or *POS*), hence if two\nheteronyms share the same grammatical role, the dictionary will list only\none of them. The other one should, of course, nevertheless be used when\nappropriate. Words where this is the case include (the missing spelling is\nlisted in parentheses):\n\n* \u2039bass\u203a: \u00abbaiss\u00bb (or \u00abbass\u00bb for various fish species)\n* \u2039drawer\u203a: \u00abdror\u00bb (or \u00abdrawer\u00bb for a person who draws)\n* \u2039logos\u203a: \u00abloagoas\u00bb (plural of \u00abloago\u00bb \u2039logo\u203a; or \u00ablogoss\u00bb for the Greek\n  word)\n* \u2039micrometer\u203a: \u00abmy'cromiter\u00bb (a measuring device; or \u00abmycromeeter\u00bb for the\n  millionth part of a meter)\n* \u2039prayer\u203a: \u00abprair\u00bb (or \u00abprayer\u00bb for a person who prays)\n* \u2039read\u203a: \u00abreed\u00bb (or \u00abred\u00bb for the past tense)\n* \u2039routed, router, routing\u203a: \u00abruuted, ruuter, ruuting\u00bb (if derived from\n  \u00abruut\u00bb \u2039route\u203a; or \u00abrouted, router, routing\u00bb if derived from \u00abrout\u00bb)\n* \u2039subsequence\u203a: \u00absubsiquenss\u00bb (for some subsequent occurrence; or\n  \u00absubseequenss\u00bb for a sequence derived from another sequence)\n* \u2039taxis\u203a: \u00abtaxies\u00bb (multiple taxis, or taxicabs; or \u00abtaxiss\u00bb, a scientific\n  term)\n* \u2039tier\u203a: \u00abteer\u00bb (or \u00abtyer\u00bb for a person who ties)\n\n\n## Other Documentation\n\n**docs/lytspel-on-one-page.md|odt|pdf**: A compact, single-page description\nof the most important rules.

The traditional English\nspelling system is afflicted with exceptions and conflicting rules, making\nwriting and reading texts unnecessarily hard.</p>\n<p>Lytspel is a proposal for reforming the English spelling in order to make\nit strictly follow the alphabetic principle. The alphabetic principle means\nthat there is a predictable relationship between written letters and spoken\nsounds. When you see a written word, you know how to pronounce it (even if\nyou don't know the word itself), and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Traditional English spelling (tradspell) deviates from the alphabetic\nprinciple in many ways. The mapping between written and spoken words is\nvery complex and riddled with irregularities and exceptions. Lytspel (for\n\u00ablytwait speling\u00bb or \u2039lightweight spelling\u203a) is a proposal to change this,\nwhile keeping as much visual similarity to tradspell as reasonably\npossible.</p>\n<p>Lytspel not only creates an unambiguous mapping between the sounds used in\nEnglish and their written representations, it also indicates which syllable\nin each word is the stressed one.</p>\n<p>In addition to the reform proposal, there is a comprehensive dictionary and\na <a href=\"https://www.lytspel.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">converter</a> that translates traditional\nspelling into Lytspel.</p>\n<p>Here are two example paragraphs written in Lytspel. The first is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_North_Wind_and_the_Sun\" rel=\"nofollow\">The North\nWind and the\nSun</a>, one of\nAesop's fables that's frequently used as an example in phonetics, while the\nsecond is made up of two nonsense sentences that contain most of the sounds\nof English.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dhe North Wind and dhe Sun wur di'spiuting wich wos dhe strongger, wen a\ntraveler caim a'long rapd in a worm cloak.

Just try reading\nit out aloud and you'll soon get the hang of it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a\ntraveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the one who\nfirst succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be\nconsidered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as hard as\nhe could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his\ncloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then\nthe Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took off his\ncloak. And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the\nstronger of the two.</p>\n<p>That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog under a calm\nautumn moon.

The reason for this is that the vowel\npreceding the stressed syllable is often spoken so quickly that it's hard\nto decide whether a schwa or one of the short vowels is pronounced and\nnot all speakers will agree on which one to use.

This prevents confusion with\nthe consonant /j/ (as in \u00abyet\u00bb) which is also spelled \u00aby\u00bb but only occurs\nbefore vowels.

This means that Lytspel cannot\ndistinguish between unstressed /i:/ and unstressed /I/ (as in \u00abbig\u00bb) in\nthese positions, but that shouldn't hurt, as /I/ is rarely used in these\npositions and dictionaries often disagree on which of these sounds to use\nanyway.</li>\n<li>This spelling is also used in the personal pronouns ending in /i:/ (as\nthese are often less stressed than other words in a sentence): \u00abhi, shi,\nwi, mi\u00bb \u2039he, she, we, me\u203a.

If the first word ends in \u00abn\u00bb, the second\n\u00abn\u00bb is omitted: \u00abcan't\u00bb from \u00abcan not\u00bb.

The capitalized \u00abO'\u00bb is spoken /oU/ (as in\n\u00abboat\u00bb).

In these cases, Lytspel recommends\nplacing a contraction marker before the final consonant in monosyllabic\nwords (\u00abai'r, nai'r, oa'r, ee'n, ma'm, bru'r\u00bb \u2039e'er, ne'er, o'er, e'en,\nma'am, br'er\u203a from \u00abever, never, oaver, eeven, madem, brudher\u00bb \u2039...,\nover, even, madam, brother\u203a) and just using a regular stress marker\notherwise (\u00abwair'air, wairso'air, nor'eester\u00bb \u2039where'er, wheresoe'er,\nnor'easter\u203a from \u00abwair'ever, wairso'ever, north'eester\u00bb \u2039wherever,\nwheresoever, northeaster\u203a).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inner capitalization instead of a stress marker:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Various Scottish and Irish names start with \u2039Mc\u203a or \u2039Mac\u203a /m@k/ followed\nby a capitalized and stressed second syllable. Lytspel recommends writing\nthese names with \u00abMc\u00bb and omitting the stress marker, e.g. \u00abMcAdem,\nMcDonel\u00bb \u2039McAdam, McDonnell\u203a. If the stressed syllable starts with a /k/\nsound, that letter is capitalized (and repeated after the initial \u00abMc\u00bb),\ne.g. \u00abMcCarti, McKee, McQueen\u00bb \u2039McCarty...\u203a. If any other syllable is\nstressed, Lytspel recommend writing the word regularly without inner\ncapitalization, e.g. \u00abMakintosh\u00bb \u2039Macintosh <em>or</em> McIntosh\u203a.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>International Pronunciation Differences</h2>\n<p>As an international language, English is currently written and spoken\nsomewhat differently in various parts of the world.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, by using a phonetic spelling, Lytspel eliminates most\ndifferences that traditionally exist between written British (BE) and\nAmerican English (AE), e.g. \u00abculer, senter, orgenys, anelys, lycenss,\ncatalog, aijing, program, chek, gray\u00bb \u2039colour/color, centre/center,\norganise/organize, analyse/analyze, licence/license, catalogue/catalog,\nageing/aging, programme/program, cheque/check, grey/gray\u203a.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, tailoring Lytspel to faithfully represent just one\nregional variety would cause many deviations from the alphabetic principle\nfor everyone else. And creating different variants of Lytspel each fitting\njust one regional variety would introduce even larger differences between\ndifferent regional varieties of written English than traditionally exist\nbetween BE and AE.</p>\n<p>Instead of going down either of theses routes, Lytspel had been designed as\nsome kind of \"global compromise.\" It aims to keep the phonetic principle\nreasonably intact for all varieties of spoken English, and particularly for\nRP (since the English language originates in England) and GA (since the\nUnited States are the country with the highest number of native English\nspeakers).</p>\n<p>Various details of the Lytspel spellings have already been motivated as\nrepresenting sound distinctions that exist either in RP or in GA, and the\n\u00abue\u00bb and \u00abuer\u00bb spellings are a compromise used in words spoken differently\nin RP and GA. But such compromises are not almost possible without making\nthe written language extremely complex and unwieldy. In other cases,\nLytspel therefore resolves differences between RP and GA by choosing one\nspelling -- often the one that keeps the written language more similar to\ntradspell or else the shorter

is commonly spoken as either /E/ or\n/i:/, e.g. \u00ablezher, predececer\u00bb \u2039leisure, predecessor\u203a.</li>\n<li>/I/ (\u00abi\u00bb) is preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /I/ or\n/aI/, e.g. \u00abcristelin, di'rect, orgeni'saition\u00bb \u2039crystalline, direct,\norganization\u203a.</li>\n<li>/I/ is also preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /I/ or /i:/\n(e.g. \u00abafro'disiac\u00bb \u2039aphrodisiac\u203a), unless its original representation is\n\u2039ee\u203a (e.g. \u00abbeen\u00bb).</li>\n<li>/i:/ (\u00abee\u00bb, \u00abi\u00bb before vowels) is preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken\nas either /i:/ or /eI/, e.g. \u00abbeeta, ga'seebo, Izrial\u00bb \u2039beta, gazebo,\nIsrael\u203a.</li>\n<li>/Q/ (\u00abo\u00bb) is preferred if a vowel is

preferred if a vowel is commonly spoken as either /U/ or\n/u:/, e.g. \u00abcoocu, hoof\u00bb \u2039cuckoo...\u203a.</li>\n<li>/Ir/ (\u00abir\u00bb) is preferred if an r-colored vowel is commonly spoken as\neither /Ir/ or /3:/, e.g. \u00absquirel\u00bb \u2039squirrel\u203a.</li>\n<li>/3:/ (\u00abur\u00bb) is preferred if an r-colored vowel is commonly spoken as\neither /3:/ or /A(r)/, e.g. \u00abclurk, durbi\u00bb \u2039clerk, derby\u203a.</li>\n<li>/w/ (\u00abw\u00bb) is preferred if a sound preceding a vowel is commonly spoken as\neither /w/ or one of /ju:/ or /jU/, e.g. \u00abjagwar\u00bb \u2039jaguar\u203a.</li>\n<li>If a vowel is spoken as a schwa or omitted altogether in some regions, as\n/aI/ elsewhere, Lytspel generally uses \u00abi\u00bb /I/ as a compromise, e.g.\n\u00abajil, vursetil\u00bb, \u2039agile, versatile\u203a.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, if a vowel is spoken with a full vowel sound in some regions,\nwhile reduced to a schwa or omitted altogether elsewhere, Lytspel tends\nto write the full version, e.g. \u00abcategoari, inevaitiv, militerri,\npoartrait, prymerri, python, roazmairi, testimoani\u00bb \u2039category,\ninnovative, military, portrait, primary, python, rosemary, testimony\u203a.</li>\n<li>/z/ (\u00abs\u00bb or \u00abz\u00bb, depending on position) is preferred if a consonant is\ncommonly spoken as either /z/ or /s/, e.g. \u00abi'rais, venisen, talizmen\u00bb\n\u2039erase, venison, talisman\u203a.</li>\n<li>If a consonant is commonly spoken as either /Z/ or /S/, final \u00absion\u00bb\n/Z@n/ is preserved if it's already the traditional ending (e.g.\n\u00abcon'vursion\u00bb \u2039conversion\u203a), otherwise /S/ (usually \u00absh\u00bb) is preferred,\ne.g. \u00abAisha, i'raisher\u00bb \u2039Asia, erasure\u203a.</li>\n<li>/si:/ (depending on position, but often \u00abci\u00bb) is preferred if a sequence\nis commonly spoken as either /si:/ or /S/, e.g. \u00abhecian, om'niciant\u00bb\n\u2039hessian, omniscient\u203a.</li>\n<li>/zi:/ (depending on position, but often \u00absi\u00bb) is preferred if a sequence\nis commonly spoken as either /zi:/ or /Z/, e.g. \u00abhoasieri, Ma'laisia\u00bb\n\u2039hosiery, Malaysia\u203a.</li>\n<li>/ti:/ (\u00abti\u00bb before vowels) is preferred if a sequence is commonly spoken\nas either /ti:/ or as one of /S, Si:, tS, tSi:/, e.g. \u00absentiant,\ncon'sortiam, bestial, bestierri\u00bb \u2039sentient, consortium, bestial,\nbestiary\u203a.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a letter is commonly either spoken or silent, Lytspel tends to preserve\nit, e.g. \u00abplatinum, trait\u00bb (not \"platnum, tray\").</p>\n<p>If speakers in different regions tend to stress different syllables,\nLytspel usually places the stress early rather than late, e.g. \u00aban adress,\ndecaid, truncait, weekend\u00bb \u2039an address, decade, truncate...\u203a. But in the\ncase of originally foreign words where a late stress placement corresponds\nto the pronunciation in the original language, it is often preserved, e.g.\n\u00abca'feen, expoa'say\u00bb \u2039caffeine, expos\u00e9\u203a.</p>\n<p>Other differences are usually unique to just one or very few words. In such\ncases, Lytspel generally prefers the pronunciation that is more similar to\nthe traditional written form, e.g. \u00abcordial, figer, shediul\u00bb \u2039...figure,\nschedule\u203a (rather than \"corjel, figyer, skejuul\").</p>\n<p>In a few cases, one pronunciation is preferred because it is more similar\nto that of a closely related word, e.g. \u00abpryveci\u00bb \u2039privacy\u203a from \u00abpryvet\u00bb\n\u2039private\u203a (rather than \"priveci\").</p>\n<h2>Limitations of the Current Dictionary</h2>\n<p>The Lytspel dictionary, as currently published, can distinguish between\nwords traditionally written the same but pronounced differently\n(heteronyms) as long as their grammatical role in a sentence is different\n-- one is a noun, while the other is a verb, for example. This allows\ndistinguishing the verb \u00abcloas\u00bb \u2039close\u203a from the adjective \u00abcloass\u00bb, the\nnoun \u00abobject\u00bb from the verb \u00abob'ject\u00bb, etc. (\u00abDhay wur tu cloass to dhe\ndoar to cloas it.\u00bb \u2039They were too close to the door to close it.\u203a / \u00abY did\nnot ob'ject to dhe object.\u00bb \u2039I did not object to the object.\u203a)</p>\n<p>However, heteronyms are currently only disambiguated by their grammatical\nrole (commonly known as <em>part of speech,</em> or <em>POS</em>), hence if two\nheteronyms share the same grammatical role, the dictionary will list only\none of them. The other one should, of course, nevertheless be used when\nappropriate. Words where this is the case include (the missing spelling is\nlisted in parentheses):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2039bass\u203a: \u00abbaiss\u00bb (or \u00abbass\u00bb for various fish species)</li>\n<li>\u2039drawer\u203a: \u00abdror\u00bb (or \u00abdrawer\u00bb for a person who draws)</li>\n<li>\u2039logos\u203a: \u00abloagoas\u00bb (plural of \u00abloago\u00bb \u2039logo\u203a; or \u00ablogoss\u00bb for the Greek\nword)</li>\n<li>\u2039micrometer\u203a: \u00abmy'cromiter\u00bb (a measuring device; or \u00abmycromeeter\u00bb for the\nmillionth part of a meter)</li>\n<li>\u2039prayer\u203a: \u00abprair\u00bb (or \u00abprayer\u00bb for a person who prays)</li>\n<li>\u2039read\u203a: \u00abreed\u00bb (or \u00abred\u00bb for the past tense)</li>\n<li>\u2039routed, router, routing\u203a: \u00abruuted, ruuter, ruuting\u00bb (if derived from\n\u00abruut\u00bb \u2039route\u203a; or \u00abrouted, router, routing\u00bb if derived from \u00abrout\u00bb)</li>\n<li>\u2039subsequence\u203a: \u00absubsiquenss\u00bb (for some subsequent occurrence; or\n\u00absubseequenss\u00bb for a sequence derived from another sequence)</li>\n<li>\u2039taxis\u203a: \u00abtaxies\u00bb (multiple taxis, or taxicabs; or \u00abtaxiss\u00bb, a scientific\nterm)</li>\n<li>\u2039tier\u203a: \u00abteer\u00bb (or \u00abtyer\u00bb for a person who ties)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other Documentation</h2>\n<p><strong>docs/lytspel-on-one-page.md|odt|pdf</strong>: A compact, single-page description\nof the most important rules.

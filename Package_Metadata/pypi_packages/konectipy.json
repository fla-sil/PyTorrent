In particular, a power law is often assumed, stating that the number of nodes with \\(n\\) neighbors is proportional to \\(n^{-\\gamma}\\), for a constant \\(\\gamma\\) [1]. This assumption can be inspected visually by plotting the degree distribution on a doubly logarithmic scale, on which a power law renders as a straight line.\n\nThe degree distribution shows the number of nodes with degree \\(n\\), in function of \\(n\\).\n\nThis plot uses a doubly logarithmic scale.\n\n## Cumulative Degree Distribution\nThe cumulative degree distribution shows the probability that the degree of a node picked at random is larger than \\(n\\), in function of \\(n\\).\n## Assortativity\nIn some networks, nodes with high degree are more often connected with other nodes of high degree, while nodes of low degree are more often connected with other nodes of low degree. This property is called assortativity, i.e., such networks are said to be assortativity. On the other hand, some networks, are dissortative, i.e., in them nodes of high degree are more often connected to nodes of low degree and vice versa. In addition to the assortativity \\(\\rho\\) defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the degrees of connected nodes, the assortativity or dissortativity of networks may be analyse by plotting all nodes of a network by their degree and the average degree of their neighbors. Thus, the assortativity plot of a network shows all nodes of a network with the degree on the X axis, and the average degree of their neighbors on the Y axis.\n## Lorenz Curve\nThe Lorenz curve is a tool originally from economics that visualizes statements of the form \u201cX% of nodes with smallest degree account for Y% of edges\u201d. The set of values \\((X,Y)\\) thus defined is the Lorenz curve. In a network the Lorenz curve is a straight diagonal line when all nodes have the same degree, and curved otherwise [1]. The area between the Lorenz curve and the diagonal is half the Gini coefficient.\n## Spectral Plot\nThe spectral distribution refers to the distribution of the eigenvalues of a characteristic matrix of the network. In KONECT, we show the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix A, of the normalized adjacency matrix N = D\u22121/2 A D\u22121/2, and of the Laplacian matrix L = D \u2212 A.\n\nAll matrices are of size |V| \u00d7 |V|, where |V| is the number of nodes in the graph.\n\nThe adjacency matrix A contains the edge weights of all edges, or 1 for unweighted networks. A contains 0 for all nodes pairs that are unconnected. For networks with multiple edges, A contains the number of edges connecting any two nodes. The matrix A has both positive and negative eigenvalues in the general case.\n\nThe matrix D is the degree matrix of the graph. It is diagonal, and contains the degree of the nodes on the diagonal entries. For weighted networks, the entries are the sum of absolute values of adjacent edge weights.\n\nThe matrix N = D\u22121/2 A D\u22121/2 is the normalized adjacency matrix. Its eigenvalues are restricted to the range [\u22121, +1].\n\nThe Laplacian matrix L = D \u2212 A has only nonnegative eigenvalues, i.e., it is positive-semidefinite.\n\nNote that the bars representing the number of eigenvalues equal to zero is cut off in most plots, since the number of such eigenvalues is usually very high.\n\n### Installation\n\nkonectipy requires Python >=3.6 to run.\n\nTo install\n\n```sh\n$ pip install konectipy\n```\n\n#### Sample Code\nUsing the package is as simple as that. All you need is a networkx graph object stored as a .gexf file.\n\n```py\nimport konectipy.konectipy as kpy\n\nplot = kpy.plot()\n\n# enter the .gexf file with the correct path\n\nplot.degree_distribution('file_path.gexf') \nplot.cumulative_dd('file_path.gexf')\nplot.assortativity('file_path.gexf')\nplot.lorenz_curve('file_path.gexf')\nplot.spectral_plot('file_path.gexf')\n```\n\n### Development\n\nWant to contribute?

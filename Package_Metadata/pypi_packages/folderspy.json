Watch folders for file/directory events with a simple API.\n\n## Supports\n* Linux, Windows, Mac\n* Python 2.7 & 3.4-3.7\n\n## Installation\n\n### pipenv\n```sh\npipenv install folderspy\n```\n\n### pip\n```sh\npip install folderspy\n```\n\n## Example\n\nCreate a ```WatchableFolder``` class for each of folders you want to watch then simply start watching them with ```FolderSpy```:\n```python\nimport pyinotify  # Linux Only\nfrom folderspy import WatchableFolder, FolderSpy\n\n\nclass SaveFolder(WatchableFolder):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n

self.listen_to = pyinotify.IN_CREATE\n\n    def process_IN_CREATE(self, event):\n        print('An item was created in this folder!')\n\n\nFolderSpy.watch(SaveFolder())\n```\n\n## Available Folder

I solve problems\"\n===========================================\n\nSummary\n-------\nMr.Wolfe is a tracker for support issues written on the Django\nframework. It is not a tracker for software issues specifically, like\nBugzilla, Jira, etc. In the latter type of tracker, issues are related\nto software, and are tracked in terms of a life cycle from incoming to\nresolving in a specific software release (or closing without a\nrelease). Mr.Wolfe on the other hand tracks support issues, that may\nbe questions, performance problems, software failures, etc. in terms\nof a life cycle from perceived problem to solved problem. An issue in\nMr.Wolfe may or may not result in a software issue.\n\nIf this summary is gibberish to you, you don't need Mr. Wolfe...\n\nPrinciples\n----------\nIssues in Mr.Wolfe are related to a Service Level Agreement, and are\nhandled according to the services agreed in the SLA. Several services\nmay be added to a SLA, like 'high priority, solve within 8 hours' or\n'low priority, solve at your leisure'. The operator dashboard will use\nthese services to determine the status of the issue, like 'critical'\n(deadline is soon) or 'normal' (sit back and relax).\n\nIssues are read from one or more mail queues (let's face it, customers\nwill just keep sending those issues per mail anyway; POP and IMAP are\nsupported) and dispatched to the proper SLA if one can be\nfound. Otherwise, it is orphaned and shown on the operator dashboard.\nThe tracker is not intended for web access by customers; their only\ninterface to issues is email. Best to keep it that way, lest your\ncustomers see the 'notification off' button...\n\nThe intended target audience of Mr.Wolfe is support teams and help\ndesks; it is an alternative to the well known OTRS, although it is\nmuch simpler, offers less features and therefore also lacks the\nincomprehensible admin interface.\n\nSee the docs directory in the package for further reading.\n\nIf you like this application, you may donate us a beer as per the\nbeer-ware licence. If you don't like it that much or find things that\ndon't work, let us know and we may fix it. Otherwise, fork us on\nGitHub. If you think it totally and utterly sucks, tough luck! We\ndon't care!

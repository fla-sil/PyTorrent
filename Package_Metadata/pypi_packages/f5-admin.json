This is a simple python API built for F5 security administrators.\n\nI implemented the Python package in order to better understand and help manage my employer F5 infrastructure. Which has a whopping 32 nodes in total, and over half million running configuration lines when combined together as of this writing.\n\n### Release Notes\nCheck out [Releases](Releases.md) document for complete information.\n\n---\n\n## How Does It Work?\nThe package provides a direct hook to the <a href=\"https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-concepts-11-2-0.html\" target=\"_blank\">F5 TMOS</a> command line interface from your local workstation, by establishing a TTY connection via SSH as the privileged user. Once hooked, the security admin will be able to\nmanipulate F5 running configuration by using the standard TMOS commands.\n\nFurthermore, the security admin can go to the next level of the playing field, by custom buildout the  automation procedures in the full-stack capable, object-oriented Python programming language from there.\n\n### Running Requirement?\nAs of November 11 2019, you'll need Python 3 environment to run the package.\n\nThe package is originally developed in Python 2.7 environment of my Macbooks Pro. Since Python 2 is depreciated end of 2019, the package is converted into [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) from version 1.1.16 onward. Note I have no plan to backward supporting 2.7.\n\nChecking your Python version with the command below:\n```bash\n$ python -V\n```\n\n### Working Examples?\nPlease refer to the [utility examples](/START.md) documents for the working examples.\n\n### API Documents\nPlease refer to [API](/API.md), for complete information on how to use this API.\n\n### Unit Testing ###\n[Unit tests](/tests) are written to ensure the quality of the code. It provides the assurance and sustainability of the project. Use the following command to run the tests:\n\n```bash\n$ cd f5-admin/\n$ python -m unittest discover tests/\n```\n\n---\n\n## Installations\nThere are several ways you can install the Python package in your favorite system.\n\n### Build the Python Package from Source\nOnce you [download and unzip](https://github.com/yangsec888/f5-admin/repository/master/archive.zip) the source code, find and run the rebuild.sh script under the source root directory:\n\n```bash\n$ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n```\n\n### Install from Python Package\nAfter the successful build, you'll also have the .gz package under 'dist' sub-folder.  You have the option to distribute it to other systems. And you can then install the software by using the Python standard package management tool [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).\n\nFor example:\n```bash\n$ sudo pip install dist/f5_admin-1.1.2.tar.gz\nPassword:\n...\nSuccessfully installed f5-admin-1.1.2\n```\n\n### Verify the Installation\nOnce installed, you'll be able to list it under your Python environment:\n```bash\n$ pip list | grep f5\nf5-admin                               1.2.0\n```\n\n---\n\n## To Do\nRefer to [TODO](/TODO.md) document for complete list of expectations / project roadmap.\n## Who is this guy?\nSam (Yang) Li serves as the IT Security Architect in the infrastructure team. He is an information security veteran with 20 years hand-on experiences in the fields.

This value will be used to calculate the potential\n  amount of money you could earn if you were fully booked out (one can be\n  allowed to dream).\n* **Work hours per day**: The number of hours you will definitely work on each\n  work day.\n* **Sick leave days**: The number of sick leave days that you estimate (this is\n  per person, not the total for all employees) \n* **Vacation days**: The number of vacation days that each employee may take\n  during this year.\n\nThese values will be used to calculate the total number of hours that your team\ncan possibly work during any month.\n\nAdd months\n++++++++++\n\nOnce you have added a year, you need to add twelve months for that year via the\nDjango admin:\n\n* **Year**: The year this month belongs to.\n* **Month**: The month number (i.e. 1 for January)\n* **Number of employees**: The number of employees that you will have during\n  this month.\n* **Public holidays**: The number of public holidays that this month has in\n  this year.\n\nAgain, these values are mainly needed to calculate the total number of hours\nthat your team can work during this month.\n\nAdd projects\n++++++++++++\n\nAfter adding a year and it's months, you need to add a few projects via the\nDjango admin:\n\n* **Name**: The display name for this project.\n* **Freckle project ID**: The project ID of this project in your freckle\n  account.\n* **Color**: A CSS color code for this project (i.e. ``#C7B06F``)\n* **Is investment**: If you are working on this project for free (i.e. for\n  internal projects), enable this checkbox.\n\nAdd project budgets to months\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFor each of your projects, add as many ``ProjectMonth`` objects as needed. For\nexample, if you have a long running project that has budgets for the whole\nyear, you would have to add twelve objects:\n\n* **Project**: The project you want to plan for.\n* **Month**: The month you want to plan for.\n* **Budget**: The budget that you can burn on this project during this month.\n* **Rate**: The hourly rate that you can bill for this project.\n\nAdd employees\n+++++++++++++\n\nBy now, your budget planning should look pretty good. It is time to add some\nemployees. You can do that via the Django admin:\n\n* **Name**: The name of your employee\n* **Freckle ID**: The user id of that employee in Letsfreckle.\n\nAdd employee project months\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFor each ``ProjectMonth`` you can define responsibilities for your employees:\n\n* **ProjectMonth**: Foreign key to the ``ProjectMonth`` you are referring to.\n* **Employee**: Foreign key to the ``Employee`` you are referring to.\n* **Responsibility**: Amount in percent (1-100). For example, 50 would mean\n  that this employee is responsible of working off 50% of the total budget\n  for this project in this month.\n\nAdd free time\n+++++++++++++\n\nIf your employees know that they will have vacation days, or there are public\nholidays, you can track those as well. This will raise the hours per day, since\nthe same amount of hours will have to be spread over lesser days available in\nthe month:\n\n* **Employee**: Foreign key to the ``Employee`` who will be absent.\n* **Day**: The day when the employee will be absent.\n* **Is public holiday**: If ``True``, we will assume that this is a public\n  holiday. This could be interesting in the future to track, public holidays,\n  sick-leave and vacation days.\n* **Is sick leave**: If ``True``, we will assume that this is a sick-leave day.\n  This could be interesting in the future to track, public holidays, sick-leave\n  and vacation days.\n\nContribute\n----------\n\nIf you want to contribute to this project, please perform the following steps\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    # Fork this repository\n    # Clone your fork\n    mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 django-freckle-budgets\n    make develop\n\n    git co -b feature_branch master\n    # Implement your feature and tests\n    git add . && git commit\n    git push -u origin feature_branch\n    # Send us a pull request for your feature branch\n\nIn order to run the tests, simply execute ``tox``.

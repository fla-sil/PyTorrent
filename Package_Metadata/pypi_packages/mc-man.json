It is created with simplicity in mind, and aims to be the difinitive\ntool to use for server maintaince, for example when updating a server. mc-man\ncan download and update spigot, craftbukkit, mcpc+, bungeecord and the mojang\nserver. It can also download and update plugins, with regards to dependencies.\nWith *one* command you can update *all* your plugins. There is also features to\nexport and import servers. They work by saving references to all plugins and\nserver jars in a json-file, which can later be used to recreate the server.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Update all plugins with one command\n* Download plugins with dependency resolution\n* All downloads are checked with checksum\n* Download and update server jars.\n\nInstalling\n----------\nmc-man is programmed in Python for Linux. It can **only** run on Python 3.3 or\nnewer. This might be a problem on some Linux distributions, but it should\nalways be possible to build Python from source, if it is not present in your\npackage manager. Together with python you need the python header files, which\nyou normally can get through a package called something like ``python3-dev``.\nIn addition to python you are recommended to have pip - the Python package\nmanager. Once you have Python 3.3 or newer, and pip for your version of Python,\nyou can run this command to install mc-man::\n\n    sudo pip3.3 install mc-man\n\nIf you are running Python 3.4, ``pip3.3`` should be replaced with ``pip3.4``.\nIf neither of those commands exists, you can try ``pip3``, but you have to\nverify that it leads to a pip version for Python 3.3 or newer.\n\nmc-man has some dependencies which will be installed automatically when\ninstalling using pip:\n\n* ``PyYaml`` - For parsing the yaml files in plugins\n* ``pyBukGet`` - For access to the BukGet API\n* ``pySpaceGDN`` - For access to the SpaceGDN API\n\nIf you install mc-man without pip, you will have to install these dependencies\nmanually.\n\nUsage\n-----\nThe base command for mc-man is ``mcman``, all of mc-man's functionality is\naccessable through that command. The command is expected to be run from the\nroot folder of the server. The functionality is divided into four sub commands:\n\nserver\n    The server command is used for managing server jars. It can be used to find\n    versions and builds, identify jars existing locally and downloading new\n    jars.\n\nplugin\n    The plugin command is used for managing plugins. It can be used to search\n    for plugins, display info about them and their versions, list downloaded\n    plugins and check which of them are out of date, update the plugins and, of\n    course, download new plugins.\n\nexport\n    The export command is used for exporting the servers state. It will find\n    all downloaded servers and plugins and save their placement, relative to\n    the server root, and their versions to a json file. This file can later be\n    used by the ``import`` command to create a new server with the same server\n    version and plugins.\n\nimport\n    The import command is used for importing a previously exported server\n    state. It will recreate a server with the info from the json file it is\n    passed.\n\nThese commands can be called with ``mcman <command>``, to manage plugins for\nexample: ``mcman plugin``. The commands can also be shortened to the first\nletter: ``mcman p``. In addition to this comprehensive documentation, a lighter\ndocumentation is included in the program, it can be accessed by adding\n``--help`` at the end of any command or subcommand, for example:\n``mcman p --help``, to get quick help for the ``plugin`` command.'\n\nOften used commands\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere are some commands that are used often:\n\n``mcman p download <plugin> [<plugin> ...]``\n    Download the plugins.\n\n``mcman p update``\n    To update all the plugins\n\n``mcman p list``\n    To list the installed plugins, and check if any are out of date.\n\n``mcman s identify <server.jar>``\n    To check what version and build a server jar is, and see if there are any\n    updates to it.\n\n``mcman s download <server> [<channel>] [<version>] [<build>]``\n    To download a server, optionally a version from the specified channel, the\n    specified version, or even a specific build.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/CubeEngineDev/mc-man", "keywords": null, "license": "GPLv3+", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "mc-man", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/mc-man/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/mc-man/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/CubeEngineDev/mc-man"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/mc-man/0.9-1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "The Minecraft server jar and plugin manager, downloader and updater", "version": "0.9-1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <blockquote>\n<em>The Minecraft server jar and plugin manager, downloader and updater</em></blockquote>\n<p>mc-man is a terminal program for managing server jars and plugins for Minecraft\nservers.

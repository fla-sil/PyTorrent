Also, as amazing as PySNMP is, it isn't exactly known for its ease of use.\r\n\r\nSome, like the net-snmp bindings and easysnmp, are built as extensions to C libraries like Net-SNMP. This makes them incredibly fast and performant, but requires them to be compiled on each platform they're distributed on, and compiled against specific versions of the Net-SNMP libraries. Not very portable at all.\r\n\r\nIn writing this library, I set out to find a middle ground. A library which could leverage the power and speed of the Net-SNMP project, while being portable pure-python and not being tied to any particular version of Net-SNMP. I accomplished this by making a library that calls the Net-SNMP binaries as subprocesses.\r\n\r\nAlthough this library should work on Windows platform that have Net-SNMP installed, it has not yet been tested on Windows.

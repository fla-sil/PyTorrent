(Note that it uses some\nMicroPython shortcuts and doesn't work with CPython).\n\nDesign requirements\n-------------------\n\n* Memory efficiency.\n* Avoid infamous design anti-patterns like \"callback hell\".\n* Support for both publishing and subscription via a single client\n  object (another alternative would be to have separate client classes\n  for publishing and subscription).\n\nAPI design\n----------\n\nBased on the requirements above, there are following API traits:\n\n* All data related to MQTT messages is encoded as bytes. This includes\n  both message content AND topic names (even though MQTT spec states\n  that topic name is UTF-8 encoded). The reason for this is simple:\n  what is received over network socket is binary data (bytes) and\n  it would require extra step to convert that to a string, spending\n  memory on that. Note that this applies only to topic names (because\n  they can be both sent and received). Other parameters specified by\n  MQTT as UTF-8 encoded (e.g. ClientID) are accepted as strings.\n* Subscribed messages are delivered via a callback. This is to avoid\n  using a queue for subscribed messages, as otherwise they may be\n  received at any time (including when client expects other type\n  of server response, so there're 2 choices: either deliver them\n  immediately via a callback or queue up until an \"expected\" response\n  arrives). Note that lack of need for a queue is delusive: the\n  runtime call stack forms an implicit queue in this case. And unlike\n  explicit queue, it's much harder to control. This design was chosen\n  because in a common case of processing subscribed messages it's\n  the most efficient. However, if in subscription callback, new\n  messages of QoS>0 are published, this may lead to deep, or\n  infinite recursion (the latter means an application will terminate\n  with ``RuntimeException``).\n\nAPI reference\n-------------\n\nTaking into account API traits described above, umqtt pretty closely\nfollows MQTT control operations, and maps them to class methods:\n\n* ``connect(...)`` - Connect to a server. Returns True if this connection\n  uses persisten session stored on a server (this will be always False if\n  clean_session=True argument is used (default)).\n* ``disconnect()`` - Disconnect from a server, release resources.\n* ``ping()`` - Ping server (response is processed automatically by wait_msg()).\n* ``publish()`` - Publish a message.\n* ``subscribe()`` - Subscribe to a topic.\n* ``set_callback()`` - Set callback for received subscription messages.\n* ``set_last_will()`` - Set MQTT \"last will\" message. Should be called\n  *before* connect().\n* ``wait_msg()`` - Wait for a server message. A subscription message will be\n  delivered to a callback set with set_callback(), any other messages\n  will be processed internally.\n* ``check_msg()`` - Check if there's pending message from server. If yes,\n  process the same way as wait_msg(), if not, return immediately.\n\n``wait_msg()`` and ``check_msg()`` are \"main loop iteration\" methods, blocking\nand non-blocking version. They should be called periodically in a loop,\n``wait_msg()`` if you don't have any other foreground tasks to perform\n(i.e. your app just reacts to subscribed MQTT messages), ``check_msg()``\nif you process other foreground tasks too.\n\nNote that you don't need to call ``wait_msg()``/``check_msg()`` if you only\npublish messages, never subscribe to them.\n\nFor more detailed information about API please see the source code\n(which is quite short and easy to review) and provided examples.\n\n\nSupported MQTT features\n-----------------------\n\nQoS 0 and 1 are supported for both publish and subscribe. QoS2 isn't\nsupported to keep code size small. Besides ClientID, only \"clean\nsession\" parameter is supported for connect as of now.\n\n\nMQTT client with automatic reconnect\n------------------------------------\n\nThere's a separate `umqtt.robust` module which builds on `umqtt.simple`\nand adds automatic reconnect support in case of network errors.\nPlease see its documentation for further details.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib", "keywords": null, "license": "MIT", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "micropython-umqtt.simple", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/micropython-umqtt.simple/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/micropython-umqtt.simple/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/micropython-umqtt.simple/1.3.4/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Lightweight MQTT client for MicroPython.", "version": "1.3.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>umqtt is a simple MQTT client for MicroPython.

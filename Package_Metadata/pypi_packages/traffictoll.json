Additionally it also allows you to\nmake use of QoS traffic prioritization for different processes.\n\nThe configuration can be easily adjusted and new limits and priorities applied at any\npoint, as opposed to similar tools which either can only apply fixed global limits to\nthe interface, certain ports, or require you to start the process through them (and thus\nrestart the target process to change the limits).\n\n# Usage\n`# tt device config`\n\nWhere `device` is the interface you want to limit (usually the one you\nconnect to the internet with). For example:\n\n* `# tt enp3s0 night.yaml --delay 0.5` (regular interface, check every\nhalf second for change in networked processes)\n* `# tt tun0 day.yaml --logging-level DEBUG` (VPN interface, adjust\nlogging level to DEBUG)\n\nCurrently TrafficToll works based on a YAML configuration file. The configuration file\nis best explained by example:\n\n```YAML\n# The rate limits for the specified interface. Specifying these values is useful for two\n# things: 1) you want to limit the used bandwidth for the entire interface or 2) you\n# want to make use of traffic prioritization.\n\n# If you want to 1) limit the used bandwidth for the entire interface, simply specify\n# values below your actual speed: the traffic will be shaped in such a way, that it does\n# not exceed the specified numbers.\n\n# If you want to 2) make use of the traffic prioritization feature, these values must be\n# as close as possible to your real speed: if they are too low, traffic prioritization\n# will work, but you are losing part of your bandwidth; if they are too high, traffic\n# prioritization won't work as well as it could. I recommend you use some internet speed\n# test you can find online to get an approximation for the correct values.\n\n# If you don't want to do 1) or 2), you can omit these values. Bandwidth limiting per\n# application will still work, just traffic prioritization won't work as well or\n# entirely.\ndownload: 5mbps\nupload: 1mbps\n\n# Guaranteed download and upload rates for all global traffic that is not shaped as part\n# of a matched process by TrafficToll. The idea here is to leave enough \"guaranteed\"\n# bandwidth to all applications not defined in \"processes\", so that they are not starved\n# to a bandwidth, by processes with higher priority, that would cause the other IP to\n# drop the connection. These are the default values, if omitted.

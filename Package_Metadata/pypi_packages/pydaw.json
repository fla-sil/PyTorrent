The\r\nrecommendations we make here follow the standards and conventions of much of\r\nthe scientific Python eco-system. Following these standards and recommendations\r\nwill make it easier for others to use your code, and can make it easier for you\r\nto port your code into other projects and collaborate with other users of this\r\neco-system.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Organization of the  project\r\n\r\nThe project has the following structure:\r\n\r\n    pythoncli/\r\n      |- README.md\r\n      |- pythoncli/\r\n         |- __init__.py\r\n         |- __main__.py\r\n         |- classmodule.py\r\n         |- effectsmodule.py\r\n         |- funcmodule.py\r\n         |- loadingmodule.py\r\n         |- resamplemodule.py\r\n         |- supereffectmodule.py\r\n      |- pythoncli.egg-info/\r\n         |- dependency_links.txt\r\n         |- entry_points.txt\r\n         |- PKG-INFO\r\n         |- SOURCES.txt\r\n         |- top_level.txt\r\n      |- setup.py\r\n      |- install.sh\r\n      |- LICENSE\r\n      |- .gitignore\r\n\r\nIn the following sections we will examine these elements one by one. First,\r\nlet's consider the core of the project. This is the code inside of\r\n`pythoncli/__main__.py`. The code provided in this file is intentionally rather\r\nsimple. It implements some simple command routing each to its specific file from the input string taken thought the terminal.\r\n\r\n### Module code\r\n\r\nWe place the module code in a file called `__main__.py` in directory called\r\n`pythoncli`. This structure  is a simple way to create a structure for the project ,\r\nwe also need to also create a file in `__init__.py` which contains code that imports\r\neverything in that file into the namespace of the project:\r\n\r\n    from .effectsmodule import *\r\n\r\nIn the module code, we follow the convention that all functions are either\r\nimported from other places, or are defined in lines that precede the lines that\r\nuse that function. This helps readability of the code, because you know that if\r\nyou see some name, the definition of that name will appear earlier in the file,\r\neither as a function/variable definition, or as an import from some other module\r\nor package.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nFor installation and distribution we will use the python standard\r\nlibrary `distutils` module. This module uses a `setup.py` file to\r\nfigure out how to install your software on a particular system. For a\r\nsmall project such as this one, managing installation of the software\r\nmodules and the data is rather simple.\r\n\r\nThis also makes it possible to install your software with using `pip` and\r\n`easy_install`, which are package managers for Python software. The\r\n`setup.py` file reads this information from there and passes it to the\r\n`setup` function which takes care of the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Continuous integration\r\n\r\nStill have not chosen a Continous Intregration / Deployment methods.\r\n\r\n### Distribution\r\n\r\nThe main venue for distribution of Python software is the [Python\r\nPackage Index](https://pypi.python.org/), or PyPI, also lovingly known\r\nas \"the cheese-shop\".\r\n\r\nTo distribute your software on PyPI, you will need to create a user account on\r\n[PyPI](http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/distributing/#register-your-project).\r\nIt is recommended that you upload your software using\r\n[twine](http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/distributing/#upload-your-distributions).\r\n\r\nUsing Travis, you can automatically upload your software to PyPI,\r\nevery time you push a tag of your software to github. The instructions\r\non setting this up can be found\r\n[here](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pypi/). You will need\r\nto install the travis command-line interface\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\nMIT License .\r\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Peter Hassaballah\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

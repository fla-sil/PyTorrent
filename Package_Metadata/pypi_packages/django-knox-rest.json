This does not facilitate\n    securely signing in from multiple devices, as the token is shared.\n    It also requires *all* devices to be logged out if a server-side\n    logout is required (i.e. the token is deleted).\n\n    Knox provides one token per call to the login view - allowing each\n    client to have its own token which is deleted on the server side\n    when the client logs out.\n\n    Knox also provides an option for a logged in client to remove *all*\n    tokens that the server has - forcing all clients to re-authenticate.\n\n-   DRF tokens are stored unencrypted in the database.

Checkout the latest django-file-upload-to release and copy or symlink the\n   ``uuid_upload_path`` directory into your ``PYTHONPATH``.  If using pip, run \n   ``pip install django-file-upload-to``.\n\n\nGenerating short UUIDs\n----------------------\n\nGenerate a short, URL-safe UUID as follows:\n\n::\n\n    from uuid_upload_path import uuid\n\n    uuid()  // -> \"hCdLEjlQQJW25-sXB3T_Gw\"\n\n\n\nGenerating upload paths\n-----------------------\n\nTo upload media files to short UUID filenames, just set `upload_to` to `uuid_upload_path.upload_to`.\n\n::\n\n    from uuid_upload_path import upload_to\n\n    class YourModel(models.Model):\n\n        file = models.FileField(\n            upload_to = upload_to,\n        )\n\n\nWhy use UUIDs as upload paths?\n------------------------------\n\nDjango tries to ensure that all your uploaded files are given unique names on the filesystem. It does this by checking if a file with the same name exists before saving a new one, and adding a suffix if the new file would otherwise conflict with the existing one.\n\nIf you're saving files to disk using the built-in ``django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage``, this isn't much of a problem. However, if you're using a cloud file storage, such as ``storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage``, this uniqueness check can have a noticeable effect on the performance of file uploads. Worse, the default configuration of `S3BotoStorage` is to overwrite existing files with the same name when uploading a new file!\n\nBy generating a unique filename for each uploaded file, django-file-upload-to removes the need for a costly uniqueness check, and avoids accidentally overwriting existing files on remote cloud storages.\n\n\nSupport and announcements\n-------------------------\n\nDownloads and bug tracking can be found at the `main project\nwebsite <https://github.com/panttojo/django-file-upload-to>`_.\n\n\nMore information\n----------------\n\nThe django-uuid-upload-path project was developed by Dave Hall and forked for make a little customizations.\nYou can get the code from the `django-uuid-upload-path project\nsite <https://github.com/etianen/django-uuid-upload-path>`_.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/panttojo/django-file-upload-to", "keywords": "", "license": "BSD", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "django-file-upload-to", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-file-upload-to/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-file-upload-to/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/panttojo/django-file-upload-to"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-file-upload-to/2.0.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.4", "summary": "Generate short UUIDs and use them as paths for uploaded media files in Django.", "version": "2.0.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>django-file-upload-to</h1>\n<p><strong>django-file-upload-to</strong> generates short UUIDs to use as paths for uploaded media files in Django.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Generate short (22 character), URL-safe base64-encoded UUIDs.</li>\n<li>Upload media files to short UUID filenames.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the latest django-file-upload-to release and copy or symlink the\n<code>uuid_upload_path</code> directory into your <code>PYTHONPATH</code>.

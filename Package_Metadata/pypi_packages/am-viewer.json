Once running the viewer can detect real-time changes in the metadata and display them in real-time. The purpose of the viewer is to be able to demonstrate the real-time capabilities of the various formats by allowing the dynamic behaviour to be viewed. The viewer also supports static display of the underlying XML representation.\n\nThe User interface has three main sections:\n- Audio Beds\n- Audio Objects\n- Presentations\n\nThe audio beds section provides a list of the main audio scenes available. These will normally be channel based and will have a configuration such as 5.1 or 5.1.4 for 5.1 with 4 overhead channels. Normally there will only be a single bed but certain use-cases make use of two beds such as home and away crowd sounds for a live sports broadcast.\n\nIf the audio bed does not contain the complete audio program and only contains music and effects then additional objects will be required and will be listed in the middle section of the user interface. This will normally include dialogue objects. This is very common where multiple language support is required. Objects that specify divergence signal to the downstream renderer that the object should be rendered as two discrete sound sources left and right of the intended position. This effect is sometimes used for dialogue objects.\n\nThe list of presentations represent a set configurations that could be made available to use. Each presentation specifies a bed and selection of objects or elements to be included. Each presentation has a name and the language used for the name is specified as well as the language of the audio itself which is specified as the presentation language. Each presentation can be monitored by pressing the buttons on the left hand side. If the buttons are not enabled then GStreamer has not been detected as being installed. Pressing a button twice switches the audio off. The audio playback will react to changes in gain and object X position. Changes in object Y and Z position can not be detected as only stereo playback is supported.\n\n## General System Requirements\n\nMacOS, Windows and Linux supported.\n\nPython 3 (Tested with Python v3.8.1 from python.org)\n\nPython Modules (install using PIP)\nscapy, zeroconf, netifaces\n\nNote: Scapy v2.4.1 and v2.4.2 has a bug that affects Windows. Windows users should revert to 2.4.0 or use 2.4.3 or later when available.\n\n## Windows Requirements\n\nNPcap (https://nmap.org/npcap/)\n\n## Mac OS Requirements\n\nSee https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html\nUse python from python.org, not Homebrew.\n\n## Linux Requirements\n\nAs well as Python, some distros may require Tkinter to be installed e.g. on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`\n\nBefore running allow python and tcpdump to open raw sockets. Failure to do this will result in permission problems when packet reception is attempted.\n\n`setcap cap_net_raw=eip <python executable>`\n\n`setcap cap_net_raw=eip <tcpdump executable> (normally /usr/sbin/tcpdump)`\n\n## Audio Playback Support System Requirements\n\nTo enable the audio playback feature, GStreamer must be installed. This will be detected on startup and the presentation selection buttons will be enabled. Make sure that gst-launch-1.0 is in the path.\n\n### Windows GStreamer installation\n\nSee https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-windows.html and https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/. Any package type should work although msvs was used for testing\n\n### Mac OS GStreamer installation\n\nThe easiest way is to install Homebrew and then use `brew install gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good`\n\n### Linux (Ubuntu) installation\n\nUbuntu generally comes with GStreamer preinstalled. If not then `sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-tools`\n\n## Installation\n\n`pip3 install am_viewer`\n\n## Instructions\n\nIf installed type `am_viewer`. If not installed, execute the run script.\n\nThe viewer can use either an XML or a IP stream as input. To use a file as input use the -xml option to specify the filename. If a stream is used as input then there are two possible ways for the viewer to obtain RTP session information. Either an SDP file can be provided using the -sdp option or the stream can be discovered using the Ravenna discovery protocol (Bonjour & RTSP).\n\nIf XML file mode is used the display will immediately update its display based on the XML file. The only control at this point is to quit the application. This is essentially a debug mode.\n\nThe stream mode is used then a list of interfaces and a list of available services will be provided on the bottom option bar. Once the appropriate interface and service has been selected then the 'Run' button can be pressed to start the monitoring of the stream. If more than one service is available then the service list can be used to switch between services. If the '-sdp' option was used then one option in the service list should correspond to the sdp file.\n\nWhen receiving a stream the 'XML' can be pressed at anytime to yield a static XMl snapshot. The XML tree can be explored by expand the various levels of the tree in the XML viewer windows.\n\nSeveral indicators on the bottom bar show status. The PMD indicator will be green when receiving PMD and grey when not. If an error is received the PMD indicator will flash or stay red for continuous errors. The SADM and AES-X242 indicators work in the same way. The subframe-mode / frame mode indicators indicate whether the received stream is using the frame mode or subframe mode of the SMPTE ST 337 container format inside the SMPTE 2110-31 stream. This indicator is not applicable for AES-X242 streams which do not use SMPTE frames.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\nOnly a bit depth of 20 bits is supported for ST 2110-31 based streams. As it is known that 24 bit is being used for sADM, this is planned to be added in the next release.  \n\nOnly sADM full frame mode is supported. Both gzip and plain XML sADM modes are supported but only gzip has been thoroughly tested.\n\nWhen playing back presentations that include VDS (Audio Description) dialogue objects. The main audio is not ducked as it should be but rather everything is statically mixed. To add the ducking requires a new custom gstreamer plug-in so this is unlikely to fixed in the next version.\n\n\n## License\n\n AM Viewer\n Copyright (c) 2020, Dolby Laboratories Inc.\n All rights reserved.\n\n Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted\n provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n 1.

As\n  long as you have the appropriate command line tools, you can install\n  ``MOOG`` and ``MOOGSILENT`` using ``pip``:\n\n    ``sudo pip install moog``\n\n  (If you don't have ``pip`` installed, you can install it with\n  ``easy_install pip`` and then use ``easy_install`` any time you would\n  have used ``pip``, `see here why\n  <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220404/why-use-pip-over-easy-install>`_.)\n\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe best way to download the code is to use ``git``.

If you are asked for a \npassword when trying to use the ``sudo`` command, then you should enter \nyour administrator password for your machine, not your GitHub\naccount password. Once ``git`` is set up, use the following command in a \nterminal:\n\n    ``git clone git@github.com:andycasey/smh.git smh``\n\nThat will clone the entire repository into a fresh folder called ``smh``.\nWhenever there is a new version of the code or a bug-fix, you can download\nthe latest copy by ``cd``'ing to your ``smh`` directory then using:\n\n    ``git pull``\n\nAnd that's it!

They'd rather put new content and new\nversions of content on *another* copy of the EDRN_ Public Portal, and then\nsomehow migrate that content when we do a new release of the portal software\nto the *official* public portal.\n\nHence, this package.\n\nThis package was developed by the Informatics Center (IC_), operated by JPL_.\n\n..

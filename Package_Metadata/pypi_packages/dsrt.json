The simplest type of model is the [`Sequential`](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide) model, a linear stack of layers. For more complex architectures, you should use the [Keras functional API](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide), which allows to build arbitrary graphs of layers.\n\nHere is the `Sequential` model:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\n\nmodel = Sequential()\n```\n\nStacking layers is as easy as `.add()`:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\n\nmodel.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))\nmodel.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))\n```\n\nOnce your model looks good, configure its learning process with `.compile()`:\n\n```python\nmodel.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n              optimizer='sgd',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n```\n\nIf you need to, you can further configure your optimizer. A core principle of Keras is to make things reasonably simple, while allowing the user to be fully in control when they need to (the ultimate control being the easy extensibility of the source code).\n```python\nmodel.compile(loss=keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy,\n              optimizer=keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True))\n```\n\nYou can now iterate on your training data in batches:\n\n```python\n# x_train and y_train are Numpy arrays --just like in the Scikit-Learn API.\nmodel.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can feed batches to your model manually:\n\n```python\nmodel.train_on_batch(x_batch, y_batch)\n```\n\nEvaluate your performance in one line:\n\n```python\nloss_and_metrics = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=128)\n```\n\nOr generate predictions on new data:\n\n```python\nclasses = model.predict(x_test, batch_size=128)\n```\n\nBuilding a question answering system, an image classification model, a Neural Turing Machine, or any other model is just as fast. The ideas behind deep learning are simple, so why should their implementation be painful?\n\nFor a more in-depth tutorial about Keras, you can check out:\n\n- [Getting started with the Sequential model](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide)\n- [Getting started with the functional API](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide)\n\nIn the [examples folder](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples) of the repository, you will find more advanced models: question-answering with memory networks, text generation with stacked LSTMs, etc.\n-->\n\n\n## How can I install it?\n\nBefore attempting to install Neural DSRT, you'll need to install Keras (which it's built on):\n\n- [Keras installation instructions](https://keras.io/#installation)\n\nIn installing Keras, you'll of course need to install a neural-network backend. We recommend TensorFlow:\n\n- [TensorFlow installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).\n\nOnce you've done this, you're ready to install DSRT. Currently, the only way to do this is from the GitHub source. Thankfully, this is pretty easy, so long as you have `pip` installed on your machine (did we mention you'll need Python? you'll need Python -- we recommend the latest version of Python 3). \n\nJust in case, instructions for installing `pip` may be found here:\n\n- [pip installation instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)\n\nAssuming you've followed up until this point, proceed to __clone DSRT__ using `git`:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/sbarham/dsrt.git\n```\n\n Now, `cd` to the Neural DSRT folder and install using `pip`:\n```sh\ncd dsrt\nsudo pip install .\n```\n\nIt's as easy as that. Now you're ready to use Neural DSRT!\n\n\n# How can I help?\n\nAs we mentioned above, DSRT is very young -- in fact, it's only a few weeks old at the moment. If you're a developer (and especially if you're confident with deep learning, machine learning, or neural dialogue systems) and you'd like to help, please contact the original authors directly at `sbarham@cs.umd.edu`.

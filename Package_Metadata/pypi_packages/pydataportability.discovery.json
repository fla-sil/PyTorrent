These are `XRD documents <http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/wiki/XrdFiles>`_ describing \na resource and optionally pointing to related resources. One use case is the \n`webfinger project <http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/>`_ where XRD is used to store\ninformation about a user. The URI identifying the user is e.g. ``acct:user@example.com``\nand this discovery component is able to retrieve information about the user via\n`LRDD <http://hueniverse.com/2009/03/the-discovery-protocol-stack/>`_.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe easiest way to install it is via ``easy_install``::\n\n    easy_install pydataportability.discovery\n\nIt is recommended to do this inside a `virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/1.3.4>`_\n\n\nSimple usage\n------------\n\nAfter installing you will have 2 new commands in your path (or virtualenv's ``bin/`` directory):\n``discover`` and ``webfinger``. These are just example scripts though. Both do discovery\non the URI you feed in but the latter will check for webfinger-relationships only and will\nadditionally check if you passed in a user identifier starting with ``acct:`` which is the\nproposed scheme of the webfinger protocol. If you didn't, it's adding it for you.\n\nHere is an example::\n\n    $ webfinger someuser@googlemail.com\n\n    Subject:  acct:someuser@googlemail.com\n\n    Rels:  ['http://portablecontacts.net/spec/1.0']\n    URIs: ['http://www-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/api/people/']\n    Media Types: []\n    Prio: 0\n    Templates: []\n\nSo this mainly prints the contents of the discovered XRD document. Note that the\nuser you are testing it with needs to enable this at Google. Check out the \n`webfinger homepage <http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/>`_ and \n`mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/webfinger/>`_ for more information.\n\n\nDocumentation \n-------------\n\nYou can find the documentation for this component at http://dataportability.net\n\n.. warning:: Note that the XRD specification and the webfinger protocol are under heavy\n   development and likely to change. \n\nLicense\n=======\n\nThis project is released under a BSD license:\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2009, Christian Scholz\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the\nfollowing conditions are met:\n\n * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n   disclaimer.\n * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n   disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n * Neither the name of the author nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\n   this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.

A single instance of the tool can handle as many\nprojects or tasks as required, with no need to deploy separate project\nor process specific environments that cannot share data.\n\nThe tool freely mixes documentation, activity management and data\naccess in ways that are appropriate to the project, process or task\nin hand. There is no constraint on how this might be done, and\ndifferent tasks or projects may use different arrangements within the\nsame environment.\n\nAccess management allows people to see and manipulate data in ways\nthat are appropriate to their role and work. Team members may work on\nmore than one task or project. Managers may manage more than one\nproject. A person can be a team member on one project and a manager on\nanother.\n\nThe key to this flexibility is a hierarchical data model with\ninterlinking between sub-trees. The structure and the links are fully\nuser controlled.\n\nLokai is a web served application, written in Python.\n\nThe code itself is written in an extendable manner that allows a\ngreat deal of flexibility in the type of data represented, and in the\npresentation of that data. Each node in the hierarchy can be\ndifferent. At its simplest, this allows for activities and\ndocumentation to be held in the same structure, so that everything\nrelevant to the project or process is to hand. Whatever data is being\nhandled, the user is presented with a consistent interface where\naccess rules and navigation are given.\n\nRequirements\n--------------------\n\nLokai requires Python 2.5 or higher. Python 3.0 is not yet supported.\n\nOther dependencies:\n\n  Posgtgresql\n\n  SqlAlchemy (version 0.6)\n\n  Werkzeug\n\n  PyUtilib\n\n  Docutils\n\n  Reportlab\n\nLokai is developed under Linux and is currently being run under\nUbuntu. Lokai itself does not use C extensions and the intention is\nthat the development is independent of operating system. However, no\ntests have been done on other operating systems, or on other\ndistributions.\n\nInstall\n--------------------\n\nDownload the package tarball and unpack it. Go into the distribution\ndirectory and run::\n\n  python setup.py install\n\nor, more simply, don't bother with the download and just type::\n\n  pip install lokai\n\nTo build a workable instance:\n\n  Create a working directory for your new instance. And change into it.\n\n  Copy ``lk_config.ini`` from the ``config`` folder of\n  the installation.\n\n  Review the content of the ``.ini`` file. It should work out of the\n  box. However, you might want to change the default database name to\n  something other than ``lokai_soft``.\n\n  Create the database::\n\n    tb_migrate.py login.login_db=max\n\n    tb_migrate.py lk_worker.nodes_db=max\n\n  Copy ``initial_data.yml`` from the ``doc/initial_settings`` folder\n  of the installation. This contains a basic administrator login and a\n  starting node for the database.\n\n  Use the initial data::\n\n    lk_initial_data -f initial_data.yml\n\n  For a quick hit, start the publisher stand alone::\n  \n    python -mlokai.lk_ui.publisher\n\n  Now browse to localhost:8080.\n\n  To configure and use the fcgi interface, please go to `our main site\n  <http://lokai.redholm.com>`_.\n\nUpgrade from version 0.2.0\n--------------------------\n\nIf you have an existing installation you will need to upgrade the\ndatabase. This is simply a matter of going to the working directory\nand running ::\n\n    tb_migrate.py login.login_db=max\n\n    tb_migrate.py lk_worker.nodes_db=max\n\n\nHelp\n--------------------\n\nDocumentation is `available <http://lokai.redholm.com>`_.

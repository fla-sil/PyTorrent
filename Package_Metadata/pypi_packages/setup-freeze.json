Touch any of the other arguments that specify requirements, like ``setup_requires`` or ``extras_require`` (yet).\r\n\r\n**How to use it**: ``pip install setup-freeze``, then ``cd`` to a directory with a ``setup.py`` in it and run ``setup-freeze``.\r\n\r\n**What you need to know**: Your ``setup.py`` needs to contain a call to ``setup()``, with an ``install_requires`` argument set to a list, tuple, or set literal that contains string literals. It also needs to be UTF-8 encoded, and parseable by the version of Python that ``setup-freeze`` is installed in (so, if you install ``setup-freeze`` globally in Python 2, your ``setup.py`` needs to be Python-2-friendly even if you're in a Python 3 virtualenv, or vice versa).\r\n\r\n**What you can do with the source code**: Whatever you like, provided that you comply with the conditions of the MIT License.\r\n\r\n**What you shouldn't blame me for**: This is beta software, and as such comes with no guarantee that it won't completely mess up your setup.py, delete your entire project, or set your computer on fire.

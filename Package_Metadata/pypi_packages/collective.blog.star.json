It is primarily designed for integrators. Most people who\nuse Plone for blogging also uses Plone as a customized content management\nsystem, and they have specific requirements and their own skin, custom content\ntypes and other integrations. It turned out that other Plone blogging products\nmake a lot of assumption about how you are to use it, what you want from a\nblog, and how your site is set up.\n\nblog.star follows a set of principles to avoid these problems:\n\n* Be modular. Not everyone wants everything your blogging software has to\n  offer.\n  \n* Be flexible. Don't assume that people want to use your software in one\n  particular way.\n  \n* Be simplistic. If there is a simple way of doing it, do it that way.\n\n* Be Ploneish. Plone already has 90% of what a blog needs built in. Use it.\n\nModular\n-------\n\nblog.star is made up of several separate modules, that each do one thing only.\nThe modules so far is:\n\n* **collective.blog.view**: Provides a blog-style view for Plone folders and\n  collections, with support for use in monthly archives.\n\n* **collective.blog.feeds**: Uses basesyndication and fatsyndication to provide\n  several types of XML/RDF feeds for folders/collections.\n\n* **collective.blog.portlets**: Portlets useful for blogging, such as a monthly\n  archive and a last posts portlet.\n  \n* **collective.blog.star**: A module that uses all of the above plus some extra\n  modules like qi.portlet.tagClouds useful for blogging. Use this is if you\n  just want simple blogging support in Plone.\n  The development of collective.blog.star was sponsored by **Jarn AS** -\n  http://www.jarn.com\n\n\n  \nFlexible\n--------\n\nIf a portlet would work great in a normal folder, why shouldn't it? There is\nno need to add the arbitrary requirement that your portlets only works in\nfolders that have a specific marker interface, for example. Marker interfaces\nare there to mark an object as being something special, even though that\n\"special\" doesn't need a separate interface. Now a blog is just a container of\nblog entries with a blog view and archives etc. There is no reason any of your\n\"blog\" portlets would only work with a folder that is marked as being a blog.\nThe portlets I'm writing for blog.star will work in any folder or collection.\n\n\nSimplistic\n----------\n\nThe blog view doesn't require anything particular from the blog entries, as\nlong at they are archetypes objects. If they aren't, well, then you need to\nmake your own blog entry view, something you might want to do anyway, to\ncontrol how they look in detail. Doing it is easy, you just create a view\ncalled blog_item_view for your content type.\n\n\nPloneish\n--------\n\nYes, you can configure Plone so that an objects default view becomes a special\nblog view when you set a marker interface on that object. But you can also\njust add the view to the list of allowed views in the portal type, and select\nthe view from the view drop down. It's simpler, more easily configurable,\nbecause you can now add that view even to custom folder types that you may\nhave without digging into the code and figuring out what marker interface to\nput where. This is how the blog view of collective.blog.view works.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nblog.star requires Plone 4.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install blog.star you simply add \"collective.blog.star\" to the list of\neggs in your buildout, run buildout and restart the Plone server. In Plone's\nportal_quickinstaller you select \"blog.star\" and install it.\n\nNow you can create a normal folder, and in the Display menu you can select\n\"Blog view\" to make the folder into a blog. You add blog entries with the\nstandard Page type, and you can even create podcast entries with the \nstandard File type.\n\nYou also have a set of new portlets available, like a Monthly Archive, a\nLast Entries and a Tag Cloud portlet.\n\n\nCommenting\n----------\n\nIf you need commenting, we recommend plone.app.discussion. The reason it's\nnot installed by blog.star is because under Plone 3 it's not trivial to\ninstall, and in Plone 4 it's included.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.2.1 (2013-10-19)\n------------------\n\n- Various bugfixes, and some more translations.\n\nThis version tested with Plone 4.1.6, 4.2.6 and 4.3.2.\n\n\n1.2 (2013-05-27)\n----------------\n\nThis version tested with Plone 4.0.10, 4.1.6, 4.2.5 and 4.3.\n\nThis will be the last major release to support Plone 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2.\nPlone 3 may work, but it is untested and unsupported.\n\nblog.star 1.2 installs:\n\n    collective.blog.view 1.5\n    collective.blog.portlets 1.4\n    collective.blog.feeds 2.1\n\nUnder Plone 4.3 it now uses the new Plone syndication support instead of\nFatsyndication. Fatsyndication is still a dependency, and will be installed,\nbut will not be active under Plone 4.3. When upgrading to Plone 4.3,\nsyndication will as a result stop working, and you must reconfigure it.\n\nI plan to improve to Plone 4.4 with the small improvements to syndication\nthat collective.blog.feeds implement under so that blog.star need not depend\non collective.blog.feeds at all in future releases.\n\nChanges to collective.blog.star:\n\n  - Added Spanish translation [macagua]\n  \n  - Added i18n support [macagua]\n\n\n\n1.1 (2012-04-17)\n----------------\n\nThis version tested with Plone 4.0.10, 4.1.4 and 4.2b2.\n\nIt installs:\n\n    collective.blog.view 1.4\n    collective.blog.portlets 1.3\n    collective.blog.feeds 1.3\n\n**Note:** When upgrading from Plone 4.0 to Plone 4.1, you need to import the\n\"Plone Discussions\" profile in portal_setup before the Blog View will work.\n\n- Starting with 1.1, collective.blog.star will now pin the versions of\n  collective.blog.view, collective.blog.portlets arnbd collective.blog.feeds.\n  The main reason for this is to make a sort of \"Known Good Set\" of these\n  modules without forcing you to use specific versions of other modules\n  that change much more often.\n\n  It also forces updates of collective.blog.star, which otherwise looks\n  like it is unmaintained, when it is not.\n\n\n1.0 (2010-06-05)\n----------------\n\n- Initial release\n\nTested with Plone 3.3.4 and 4.0b3", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/collective/collective.blog.star", "keywords": "plone blog", "license": "GPL", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "collective.blog.star", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/collective.blog.star/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/collective.blog.star/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/collective/collective.blog.star"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/collective.blog.star/1.2.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Blog suite for Plone", "version": "1.2.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"introduction\">\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>collective.blog.*, or just blog.star, for short, is a suite of blogging\nmodules for Plone.

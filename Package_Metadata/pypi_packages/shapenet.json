It supports mixed precision training and inference via [NVIDIA/APEX](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) (must be installed separately). The data-handling is outsourced to [shapedata](https://github.com/justusschock/shapedata).\n        \n        The following gives a short overview about the packages and classes.\n        \n        #### `shapenet.networks` \n        The `networks` subpackage contains the actual implementation of the shapenet with bindings to integrate the `ShapeLayer` and other feature extractors (currently the ones registered in `torchvision.models`).\n        \n        #### `shapenet.layer`\n        The `layer` subpackage contains the Python and C++ Implementations of the ShapeLayer and the Affine Transformations. It is supposed to use these Layers as layers in `shapenet.networks`\n        \n        #### `shapenet.jit`\n        The `jit` subpackage is a less flexible reimplementation of the subpackages `shapenet.networks` and `shapenet.layer` to export trained weights as jit-ScriptModule\n        \n        #### `shapenet.utils`\n        The `utils` subpackage contains everything that did not suit into the scope of any other package. Currently it is mainly responsible for parsing of configuration files.\n        \n        #### `shapenet.scripts`\n        The `scripts` subpackage contains all scipts described in [Scripts](#by-scripts) and their helper functions.\n        \n        ### Pretrained Weights\n        Currently Pretrained Weights are available for [grayscale faces](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QS2GUZK9xKWvpbDYgUCc-m0qI60TMnLj/view?usp=sharing) and [cats](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13S-4vLmmUBNy2XKJl_yR1u7Z283Iu1zB/view?usp=sharing).\n        \n        For these Networks the image size is fixed to 224 and the pretrained weights can be loaded via `torch.jit.load(\"PATH/TO/NETWORK/FILE.ptj\")`. The inputs have to be of type `torch.Tensor` with dtype `torch.float` in shape `(BATCH_SIZE, 1, 224, 224)` and normalized in a range between (0, 1).\n        \n        \n        ## Our Paper\n        If you use our Code for your own research, please cite our paper:\n        ```\n        @article{Kopaczka2019,\n        title = {Super-Realtime Facial Landmark Detection and Shape Fitting by Deep Regression of Shape Model Parameters},\n        author = {Marcin Kopaczka and Justus Schock and Dorit Merhof},\n        year = {2019},\n        journal = {arXiV preprint}\n        }\n        ```\n        A link to the PDF will be given as soon, as the preprint is online available.\n        \nPlatform: UNKNOWN\nClassifier: Development Status :: 4 - Beta\nClassifier: Intended Audience :: Developers\nClassifier: Intended Audience :: Education\nClassifier: Intended Audience :: Science/Research\nClassifier: Natural Language :: English\nClassifier: Programming Language :: Python :: 3\nClassifier: Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence\nClassifier: Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Medical Science Apps.\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/justussschock/shapenet", "keywords": "", "license": "BSD 2-Clause License", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "shapenet", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/shapenet/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/shapenet/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/justussschock/shapenet"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/shapenet/0.1.0/", "requires_dist": ["delira[torch]", "shapedata", "ninja", "kaggle", "pandas"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "", "version": "0.1.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            Copyright (c) 2019, Justus Schock<br>All rights reserved.<br><br>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without<br>modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:<br><br>* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this<br>  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.<br><br>* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,<br>  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation<br>  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.<br><br>THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"<br>AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE<br>DISCLAIMED.

The pyflation\npackage can be installed as a normal Python package to the site-packages \ndirectory or each run of the code can be self-contained with code, results and \nlogs all contained in a run directory.\n\nThe \"pyflation_newrun.py\" script creates a new run directory and populates it with the \ncode and sub-directories which are required.\nIn particular the file \"provenence.log\" in the \"applogs\" directory contains \ninformation about the version of the code and system libraries at the time of \nthe creation of the run.\n\nMore information about Pyflation is available at the website \nhttp://pyflation.ianhuston.net.

one defining parameters (arguments) being passed to the service and one defining the return value.\nService requests are tied directly to reply messages, so when multiple clients are connected to a single *service server* only the calling client will receive the corresponding reply message.\n\n#### Services Over Topics\nServices are implemented using MiniBus topics.\nThe service name is used to specify a topic namespace under which three well-known topics are automatically created.\nOne topic (``__request__``) is used for *calling* the service and sending parameters to be used for execution.\nIf the service finishes executing normally and returns a value, this is passed back to the calling client on the ``__reply__`` topic.\nOtherwise, if an exception occurs while executing the service, the error message is returned to the calling client on the ``__error__`` topic.\nThis implementation is abstracted by the client interface.\n\n## Python API\n\nThere are currently two Python implementations of the MiniBusClientAPI - a threaded socket version and a Twisted version.\n\n```\nclass MiniBusClientAPI(object):\n    \"\"\" Defines the public API for interacting with the minibus \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, name, cryptokey=None):\n\n    def publisher(self, topic_name, data_format):\n\n    def subscribe(self, name_pattern, data_format, callback, headers=False):\n\n    def unsubscribe(self, name_pattern, callback):\n\n    def service_client(self, name, reqst_schema, reply_schema, reply_cb, err_cb):\n\n    def service_func_client(self, name, reqst_schema, reply_schema):\n        \"\"\" Returns a function that behaves like a local function.\n        retval = proxyfunc(params)\n        \"\"\"\n\n    def service_func_server(self, name, reqst_schema, reply_schema, func):\n        \"\"\" Provides a named network service linked to a local function.\n        my_func(params...)\n        Client receives the value returned by the function.\n        This is a convenience function that wraps the functionality of service_server()\n        around a single function which returns a value to be sent back to the client.\n        \"\"\"\n\n    def service_server(self, name, reqst_schema, reply_schema, func):\n        \"\"\" Provides a named network service. Service work is received by the\n        func parameter, including an srvid value and received parameters.\n        The srvid value is used to identify the client's \"work order\" information\n        and must be passed to one of the two reply functions.\n        Service returns value to client when a value is passed to either\n        service_server_return() or service_server_error().\n        \"\"\"\n\n    def service_server_return(self, srvid, value):\n        \"\"\" Used by a service server to send a return value to a service client \"\"\"\n\n    def service_server_error(self, srvid, value):\n        \"\"\" Used by a service server to send an error value to a service client \"\"\"\n```\n\n## Bus Protocol\nThe current version of MiniBus sends all messages over Multicast UDP at address ``228.0.0.5:8005``.\nFuture versions of the protocol are planned to use a combination of Multicast UDP, TCP, and IPC. \n\n### Message format\nMessages are passed between clients formatted in serialized JSON *packets* defined by a *bus schema*.\nThe bus schema defines a *packet* to contain a *header* object and a *data* field. \nThe *header* is a JSON object consisting of the topic name as a string.\nThe *data* field contains a string with the message as a serialized JSON object inside it. \n\n## Dependencies\nThese python dependencies are all available in pip, apt, and macports repositories (although they may be under different names)\n\n* ``python 2.7``\n* ``jsonschema``\n* ``netifaces``\n* ``Twisted`` (optional: for Twisted client)\n* ``gnupg`` (optional: for encryption)",

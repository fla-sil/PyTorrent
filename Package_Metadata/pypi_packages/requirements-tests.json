Aborting installation.\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nIf we had no such package on PyPI, you could accidentally install a\npackage installed with the name of your requirements file. A malicious\nuser could register a package that would mimic proper installation\nprocess and also launch anny arbitrary code.\n\nPyPI (fortunately) does not allow ``requirements.txt`` as a package\nname, so that case is handled already. All forbidden package names that\nare `hardcoded in PyPI source\ncode <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/pypi/src/76e6e7117e388fa6748d2410576c12e09d875318/webui.py?fileviewer=file-view-default#webui.py-2297>`__\nare:\n\n-  ``requirements.txt``\n-  ``rrequirements.txt``\n-  ``requirements-txt``\n-  ``rrequirements-txt``\n\nBut it obviously does not cover all popular cases.

Typo squatting happens on PyPI from time to time. This project is\nthe best example of that. Previous version of ``requirements.txt``\nactually did something more than aborting its installation. It provided\na specially crafted ``setup.py`` script that could:\n\n-  look on your filesystem to find a requirements file you intended to\n   install\n-  install all packages in another pip subprocess\n-  display output that would mimick normal installation process\n\nNewer versions of pip completely swallow all output of package\ninstallation script but thih behavior can be easily bypassed - at least\non OS X and Linux. Also runtime version switch (to ``0.0.0``) allowed to\ninstall this package over and over becasue there was always newer\nversion available on PyPI. If something went wrong (especially on\nWindows) it resulted in crypting and rude error message.\n\nNothing harmful. Actually useful sometimes. At least in my personal\nopinion. Anyway my sense of usability and humour `was contested by some\npeople <https://github.com/pylola/requirements.txt/issues/1>`__. This is\nwhy ``requirements.txt`` will longer install other packages and always\nexit with error code during installation. This is mostly thanks to\npull-request from @aanand and `his\npoints <https://github.com/pylola/requirements.txt/pull/2>`__.

(Sorry Pocket guys) )\n\n```bash\nUsage: pypocketexplore batch [OPTIONS]\n\n  Download items for all topics recursively.  USE WITH CAUTION!\n\nOptions:\n  --n INTEGER      Max number of total items to download\n  --limit INTEGER  Limit items to download per topic\n  --out TEXT       JSON output filepath\n  --nlp            If set, also downloads the page and applies NLP (through\n                   NLTK)\n  --mongo TEXT     Mongo DB URI to save items\n  --help           Show this message and exit.\n```\n\n**CAUTION**\nThis mode with all goodies enabled will take few days to run and then collect around 300k unique items\nthrough 8k topics.\nI have tried to space the requests to Pocket's servers and handle rate limit errors, \nbut one can never be sure with such things.\n\n## Web API\n\nTo have access to a standalone web API you need to clone the repo locally first.\n```shell\n$ git clone git@github.com:Florents-Tselai/PyPocketExplore.git\n$ cd PyPocketExplore\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nTo run this API application, use the `flask` command as same as [Flask Quickstart](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/)\n\n```shell\n$ cd PyPocketExplore\n$ export FLASK_APP=./PyPocketExplore/pypocketexplore/api/api.py\n$ export FLASK_DEBUG=1 ## if you run in debug mode.\n$ flask run\n * Running on http://localhost:5000/\n```\n\n## Web API Documentation\n\n### Topic\n\n* `GET /api/topic/{topic}` - Get topic data\n\nExample topics: `python, finance, business` and more\n\nExample `GET /api/topic/python`\n\n#### Response\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"excerpt\": \"For part 1, see here.

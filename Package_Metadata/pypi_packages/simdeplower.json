From those products simdeplower will use\nvmrun and ovftool. simdeplower uses ovftool to deploy (extract) an ova onto the filesystem then uses vmrun to launch\nthe extracted VMX. Once the VM is up and running simdeplower uses paramiko to ssh in using the default username and\npassword of \"root\" and \"vmware\" and executes a shell script you provide, or a bundled script that will configure the\nappliance as a simulator. This only works on VCSA 5.x products because simulator no longer works on 6.x\n\n\nInstalling\n==========\nTo install it is best to create a new virtualenv and install using pip\nFor detailed instructions see the `wiki <https://github.com/virtdevninja/simdeplower/wiki>`_ on GitHub\n\n\nContributing\n============\nTo contribute to simdeplower please follow the fork, branch, pull request work flow.

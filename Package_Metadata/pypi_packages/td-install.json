This does not contain any assets from\n[Tokyo Dark](http://www.tokyodark.com/) and requires a Steam login which has\npurchased [Tokyo Dark](http://www.tokyodark.com/) to build.\n\n## Installation\nTo install, run `pip install td_install` in Terminal. This application was\ndeveloped in Python 3.6.4, but will likely work in any modern version of Python\n(either of version 2 or 3).\n\n## Usage\nThere are two modes that you can run `td_install` in: *Installation Mode* and\n*Debugging Mode*. *Installation Mode* is the intended, default installation\nmethod for the macOS version of [Tokyo Dark](http://www.tokyodark.com/).\nHowever, there are some bugs in SteamCMD that makes it that if you suspect\nsomething is wrong, perhaps *Debugging Mode* will be better.\n\n**To install Tokyo Dark via *Installation Mode***\n\nIn Terminal, run `td_install`. The installer will will ask for your Steam\ncredentials as well as a installation directory at the end, so it is a\nsemi-interactive procedure.\n\n**To install Tokyo Dark via *Debugging Mode***\n\nDebugging mode will show the output of all internal commands run by `td_install`.\nIn order to install Tokyo Dark in this manner, run `td_debug` in Terminal.\n\n## Notes\n1. Steam typically will open a Finder window. This is completely normal,\nand the window can be closed immediately if wanted. Not quite sure why this\nhappens.\n2. Steam will sometimes crash or hang when logging in and updating. If \nSteam **crashes**, you will get notified through the Terminal immediately as\n`td_install` will crash. If Steam **hangs**, then it is harder to detect \noutside of debugging mode since it will appear to just be downloading Tokyo\nDark. If you suspect that Steam is hanging (i.e. the download is taking longer\nthen you would expect given your internet conditions), you can check by going \ninto the network tab in Activity Monitor and seeing if there is significant network\nactivity from `steamcmd`, which would indicate that Steam is working as expected.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/FrederickGeek8/td_install", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT License", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "td-install", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/td-install/", "platform": "MacOS X", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/td-install/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/FrederickGeek8/td_install"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/td-install/0.0.2/", "requires_dist": ["future", "patch (==1.*)", "progressbar2"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Tokyo Dark macOS port creation tool.", "version": "0.0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Tokyo Dark macOS Port</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitter.im/td_install/Lobby?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge&amp;utm_content=badge\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Join the chat at https://gitter.im/td_install/Lobby\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/d658d148630844d051c17e7b736fa5f63d850e86/68747470733a2f2f6261646765732e6769747465722e696d2f46726564657269636b4765656b382f74645f696e7374616c6c2e737667\"></a></p>\n<p>Automated <a href=\"http://www.tokyodark.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tokyo Dark</a> macOS port creation tool.\nBuilt to run on macOS.

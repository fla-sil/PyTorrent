For the purpose of this tutorial, the only required information is ``aws_access_key_id`` and ``aws_secret_access_key``. You can find these by logging into the AWS management console.\n\nNext let's open ``service.py``, in here you'll find the following function:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    def handler(event, context):\n        # Your code goes here!\n        e = event.get('e')\n        pi = event.get('pi')\n        return e + pi\n\n\nThis is the handler function; this is the function AWS Lambda will invoke in response to an event. You will notice that in the sample code ``e`` and ``pi`` are values in a ``dict``. AWS Lambda uses the ``event`` parameter to pass in event data to the handler.\n\nSo if, for example, your function is responding to an http request, ``event`` will be the ``POST`` JSON data and if your function returns something, the contents will be in your http response payload.\n\nNext let's open the ``event.json`` file:\n\n.. code:: json\n\n    {\n      \"pi\": 3.14,\n      \"e\": 2.718\n    }\n\nHere you'll find the values of ``e`` and ``pi`` that are being referenced in the sample code.\n\nIf you now try and run:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    (pylambda) $ lambda invoke -v\n\nYou will get:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    # 5.858\n\n    # execution time: 0.00000310s\n    # function execution timeout: 15s\n\nAs you probably put together, the ``lambda invoke`` command grabs the values stored in the ``event.json`` file and passes them to your function.\n\nThe ``event.json`` file should help you develop your Lambda service locally. You can specify an alternate ``event.json`` file by passing the ``--event-file=<filename>.json`` argument to ``lambda invoke``.\n\nWhen you're ready to deploy your code to Lambda simply run:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    (pylambda) $ lambda deploy [--preserve-vpc] [--preserve-variables]\n\nThe deploy script will evaluate your virtualenv and identify your project dependencies. It will package these up along with your handler function to a zip file that it then uploads to AWS Lambda.\n\nYou can now log into the `AWS Lambda management console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`_ to verify the code deployed successfully.\n\nWiring to an API endpoint\n=========================\n\nIf you're looking to develop a simple microservice you can easily wire your function up to an http endpoint.\n\nBegin by navigating to your `AWS Lambda management console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`_ and clicking on your function. Click the API Endpoints tab and click \"Add API endpoint\".\n\nUnder API endpoint type select \"API Gateway\".\n\nNext change Method to ``POST`` and Security to \"Open\" and click submit (NOTE: you should secure this for use in production, open security is used for demo purposes).\n\nAt last you need to change the return value of the function to comply with the standard defined for the API Gateway endpoint, the function should now look like this:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    def handler(event, context):\n        # Your code goes here!\n        e = event.get('e')\n        pi = event.get('pi')\n        return {\n            \"statusCode\": 200,\n            \"headers\": { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"},\n            \"body\": e + pi\n        }\n\nNow try and run:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ curl --header \"Content-Type:application/json\" \\\n           --request POST \\\n           --data '{\"pi\": 3.14, \"e\": 2.718}' \\\n           https://<API endpoint URL>\n    # 5.8580000000000005\n\nEnvironment Variables\n=====================\nLambda functions support environment variables. In order to set environment variables for your deployed code to use, you can configure them in ``config.yaml``.  To load the\nvalue for the environment variable at the time of deployment (instead of hard coding them in your configuration file), you can use local environment values (see 'env3' in example code below).\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n  environment_variables:\n    env1: foo\n    env2: baz\n    env3: ${LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME}\n\nThis would create environment variables in the lambda instance upon deploy. If your functions don't need environment variables, simply leave this section out of your config.\n\nUploading to S3\n===============\nYou may find that you do not need the toolkit to fully deploy your Lambda or that your code bundle is too large to upload via the API.  You can use the ``upload`` command to send the bundle to an S3 bucket of your choosing.\nBefore doing this, you will need to set the following variables in ``config.yaml``:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    role: basic_s3_upload\n    bucket_name: 'example-bucket'\n    s3_key_prefix: 'path/to/file/'\n\nYour role must have ``s3:PutObject`` permission on the bucket/key that you specify for the upload to work properly. Once you have that set, you can execute ``lambda upload`` to initiate the transfer.\n\nDeploying via S3\n=================\nYou can also choose to use S3 as your source for Lambda deployments.  This can be done by issuing ``lambda deploy_s3`` with the same variables/AWS permissions you'd set for executing the ``upload`` command.\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nDevelopment of \"python-lambda2\" is facilitated exclusively on GitHub. Contributions in the form of patches, tests and feature creation and/or requests are very welcome and highly encouraged. Please open an issue if this tool does not function as you'd expect.\n\n\nHow to release updates\n----------------------\n\nIf this is the first time you're releasing to pypi, you'll need to run: ``pip install -r tests/dev_requirements.txt``.\n\nOnce complete, execute the following commands:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    git checkout master\n\n    # Increment the version number and tag the release.\n    bumpversion [major|minor|patch]\n\n    # Upload the distribution to PyPi\n    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload\n\n    # Since master often contains work-in-progress changes, increment the version\n    # to a patch release to prevent inaccurate attribution.\n    bumpversion --no-tag patch\n\n    git push origin master --tags", "description_content_type": "text/x-rst", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/wassimsalib/python-lambda2", "keywords": "python-lambda2", "license": "ISCL", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "python-lambda2", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/python-lambda2/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/python-lambda2/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/wassimsalib/python-lambda2"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/python-lambda2/3.3.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "The bare minimum for a Python app running on Amazon Lambda.", "version": "3.3.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-lambda2/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Pypi\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/84647aca721bca9bdda136f14ae9fdba6903b755/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f707970692f762f707974686f6e2d6c616d6264612e737667\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-lambda2/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Python Versions\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/a1f2e771dbee273b41905e31a85efc383e85fc9d/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f707970692f707976657273696f6e732f707974686f6e2d6c616d6264612e737667\"></a>\n<p>Python-lambda is a toolset for developing and deploying <em>serverless</em> Python code in AWS Lambda.</p>\n<div id=\"description\">\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>AWS Lambda is a service that allows you to write Python, Java, or Node.js code that gets executed in response to events like http requests or files uploaded to S3.</p>\n<p>Working with Lambda is relatively easy, but the process of bundling and deploying your code is not as simple as it could be.</p>\n<p>The <em>Python-Lambda2</em> library takes away the guess work of developing your Python-Lambda services by providing you a toolset to streamline the annoying parts.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"requirements\">\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Python 2.7 &amp; 3.6 (At the time of writing this, AWS Lambda only supports Python 2.7/3.6).</li>\n<li>Pip (~8.1.1)</li>\n<li>Virtualenv (~15.0.0)</li>\n<li>Virtualenvwrapper (~4.7.1)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"getting-started\">\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>First, you must create an IAM Role on your AWS account called <cite>lambda_basic_execution</cite> with the <cite>LambdaBasicExecution</cite> policy attached.</p>\n<p>On your computer, create a new virtualenv and project folder.</p>\n<pre>$ mkvirtualenv pylambda\n<span class=\"o\">(</span>pylambda<span class=\"o\">)</span> $ mkdir pylambda\n</pre>\n<p>Next, download <em>Python-Lambda</em> using pip via pypi.</p>\n<pre><span class=\"o\">(</span>pylambda<span class=\"o\">)</span> $ pip install python-lambda2\n</pre>\n<p>From your <tt>pylambda</tt> directory, run the following to bootstrap your project.</p>\n<pre><span class=\"o\">(</span>pylambda<span class=\"o\">)</span> $ lambda init\n</pre>\n<p>This will create the following files: <tt>event.json</tt>, <tt>__init__.py</tt>, <tt>service.py</tt>, and <tt>config.yaml</tt>.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s begin by opening <tt>config.yaml</tt> in the text editor of your choice.

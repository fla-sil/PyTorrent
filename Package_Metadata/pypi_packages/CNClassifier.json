In general , the patient looked acutely and chronically ill . Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat examination revealed the oropharynx was clear . Sclerae were anicteric . Mucous membranes were moist . Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardic first heart sound and second heart sound . No murmurs , rubs , or gallops .

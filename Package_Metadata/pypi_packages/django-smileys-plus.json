It can replace whatever pattern you want with an\nimage of your choosing.  There's gotta be something useful in that, right?\n\nThis application can make your blog, forums, photo galleries, user comments,\netc a little more interesting, and it's very simple to install.  Free icon sets\nplague the Internet, and you can choose whatever icons you'd like to use!\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n* Strict pattern matching: you can specify very strict patterns for your\n  smileys\n* Regular expression pattern matching: if you need a little more power in your\n  pattern matching capabilities, you can specify that your patterns are regular\n  expressions (on a per-smiley basis) and the filter should know what to do.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nThis application was built on Django 1.0.2, and it should work with any version\nof Django that uses the ``admin.site.register`` method for telling the Django\nadmin that a model should appear in the admin (as opposed to the ``class\nAdmin:`` method).\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nDownload ``django-smileys`` using *one* of the following methods:\n\neasy_install or pip\n-------------------\n\nYou can download the package from the `CheeseShop\n<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-smileys/>`_ or use one of the following\ncommands::\n\n    easy_install django-smileys\n    pip install -U django-smileys\n\nto download and install ``django-smileys``.\n\nClone From Version Control\n--------------------------\n\nYou can grab the latest copy of the source code by cloning the project from one\nof these official repositories::\n\n    hg clone http://bitbucket.org/codekoala/django-smileys\n    git clone http://github.com/codekoala/django-smileys.git\n    hg clone http://django-smileys.googlecode.com/hg django-smileys\n\nPackage Download\n----------------\n\nDownload the latest ``.tar.gz`` file from the downloads section and extract it\nsomewhere you'll remember.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nFirst of all, you must add this project to your list of ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in\n``settings.py``::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        'django.contrib.admin',\n        'django.contrib.auth',\n        'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n        'django.contrib.sessions',\n        'django.contrib.sites',\n        ...\n        'smileys',\n        ...\n    )\n\nYou can also define a path to upload smileys, instead of the default one.\n\n    SMILEYS_PATH = 'your_path' # defaults to 'smiley' is not set\n\nRun ``manage.py syncdb``.  This creates a the table in your database that is\nnecessary for operation.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nOpen the template file that you want to have your smileys appear in and make\nsure it has something like this in it::\n\n    {% load smiley_tags %}\n\n    {% block content %}\n    {{ some_content_var|smileys }}\n    {% endblock %}\n\nThe ``smiley_tags`` library provides you with a ``smileys`` filter, which will\nexamine your database for all active smileys.  It then runs though\n``some_content_var`` (in this example) and replaces the patterns it finds with\nthe respective smileys.  More recent versions also contain a\n``textile_smileys`` tag for users of Textile formatting.

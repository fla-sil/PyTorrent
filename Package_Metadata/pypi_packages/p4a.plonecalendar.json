As a result\nupgrading to p4a.plonecalendar can be a bit of work.\n\nStep 1:\n-------\n\nFirstly you need to add p4a.subtyper to your buildout.cfg.\n\nUnder [instance] add \"4a.subtyper\" to the eggs property, remove\np4a.plonecalendars zcml entries and replace them with p4a.subtypers zcml\nentries. The result should look something like this:\n\n    [instance]\n    ...\n    \n    eggs = \n        Plone\n        p4a.plonecalendar\n        p4a.subtyper\n        ${buildout:eggs}\n\n    zcml = \n        p4a.subtyper\n        p4a.subtyper-meta\n\nRun buildout and restart the server.\n\nStep 2:\n-------\n\nGo to the ZMI and open the Upgrades tab of portal_setup: \n   http://yourplonesite/portal_setup/manage_upgrades\n   \nChoose the p4a.plonecalendar:default profile, and the upgrade named\n\"Upgrade to 2.1: Remove all marker interfaces\" should be visible.\nSelect it and press \"Upgrade.\"\n\nStep 3:\n-------\n\nThen go to the quickinstaller: \n   http://yourplonesite/portal_quickinstaller/manage_installProductsForm\n   \nHere, reinstall P4A Plone Calendar. You will after this have to go to all\ncalendars and select a Calendar View as default view again.\n\nStep 4 (optional):\n------------------\n\nIf you have no other parts of Plone4Artists installed you can also uninstall\nPlone4Artists Subtyper, and remove it from the buildout.cfg.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n1. Add p4a.plonecalendar as a dependency either to your buildout:\n      [buildout]\n      eggs = p4a.plonecalendar\n\n2. Include p4a.plonecalendar ZCML:\n      [instance]\n      zcml = p4a.plonecalendar\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nImporting an iCalendar file via http\n------------------------------------\n\nPlone4Artists calendar can import an iCalendar file over http into a Plone\ncalendar. This is useful for example if another site presents a schedule\nthat you also want to present or integrate into your site.\n\nAn example url for importing an icalendar file over http is::\n\n  http://path/to/calendar/import_from_url?url=http://url/to/icalendarfile.ics\n\nThis will open up a connection to the other site, get the icalendar file\ncalled \"icalendarfile.ics\" and import it into the folder located at \n/path/to/calendar/\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\n  * Maintainer, Lennart Regebro - regebro (at) gmail.com\n  * Rocky Burt - rocky (at) serverzen.com\n  * Nate Aune - natea (at) jazkarta.com\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n\n2.1 (2013-05-21)\n----------------\n\nThis version was tested with Plone 4.0.10, 4.1.6, 4.2.5,\nPlone 3 is no longer supported, but may still work.\n\n- Don't depend on p4a.calendar [tomgross]\n\n- Use jQuery instead of KSS. [regebro]\n\n- New buildouts for development on various Plone versions. [regebro]\n\n\n2.1b1 (2012-08-04)\n------------------\n\nThis version was tested with Plone 3.3.5, Plone 4.1.6 and Plone 4.2.\n\n- ignore cases where ICalendarSupport is already properly uninstalled on uninstall step. [iElectric] \n\n- Added support for i18n. [macagua]\n\n- Added support for Spanisn translation. [macagua]\n\n- make views subclass Products.Five.browser.BrowserView so that their templates\n  can be customized through portal_view_customizations. [swampmonkey]\n  \n- Removed tests for p4a.ploneevent. It hasn't had any new users since 2009, afaik. [regebro]\n\n- No longer uses p4a.subtyper. The calendar views are just normal views. [regebro]\n\n- Added upgrade step to get rid of all marker interfaces, etc. \n  This also means we no longer need an uninstall, and therefore also no Extensions/Install.py\n  so they have also been removed. [regebro]\n\n- Now uses the z3c.autoinclude.plugin. [regebro]\n\n- Added Plone 4.1 and 4.2 support. [regebro]\n\n2.0a7 (2010-08-01)\n------------------\n\n- Update profile installation to work with GenericSetup 1.6.x. [davisagli]\n\n- Made IObjectModifiedEvent import location conditional for compatibility with\n  Zope 2.12. [tom_gross]\n\n2.0a6 (2009-08-07)\n------------------\n\n- The import link is no longer shown in Topics. [regebro]\n\n\n2.0a5 (2009-07-05)\n------------------\n\n- Removed p4a.ploneevent as a dependency. It's not required. [regebro]\n\n\n2.0a3 (2009-05-17)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed issue where a TopicEventProvider died on topics with no criteria. This\n  fixes #152 [claytron]\n\n- Fixed an issue where a recurring event would show up in TopicEventProvider\n  results no matter what the criteria on the topic were. [claytron]\n\n- Added uninstalling support, which fixes #168. [regebro]\n\n- Updated wording to be consistent with other iCal/vCal actions. [aaronvanderlip]\n\n- Fixed an issue where a recurring event would show up in TopicEventProvider\n  results no matter what the criteria on the topic were. [lucielejard]\n\n- Fixed Trac #138 (fixing daily 'Add...' link so it defaults start/end dates\n  to the proper day) by building a portal_factory link with startDate and \n  endDate query string parameters for each day. [brianfive]\n\n- Re-enabled the import UI by adding beforecontent viewlet that shows\n  icon and link. [aaronvanderlip]\n\n\n2.0a2 (2008-10-04)\n------------------\n\n- Implemented the canCreate method for the ATEventCreator so that the 'Add...'\n  does not show for anonymous. [claytron]\n\n- Updated the way we get all the events in the exportCalendar method and\n  added parameters for restricting the export. [lucielejard]\n\n- Various fixes in the recurring event support.\n\n\n2.0a1 (2008-07-09)\n------------------\n\n- Reworked to use dateables views and interfaces instead of p4a.calendar.\n\n- Package is now installable via CMFQuickInstaller.\n\n- Dependentent package slugs are now included (meta and regular).\n\n\n1.1 (2008-04-12)\n----------------\n\n- Updated documentation\n\n- Fixed some install bugs under Plone 2.5.\n\n\n1.1b1 (2008-02-20)\n------------------\n\n- Plone 3 support\n\n- Now uses p4a.subtyper\n\n- Various timezone fixes, and some minor fixes.\n\n\n1.0 (2007-10-14)\n----------------\n\n- Fixed issue #24 where folders created by uploading ICS files via\n  webdav were not becoming calendar enhanced [Rocky Burt]\n\n- Fixed issue #41 where regular users couldn't activate their\n  own folders to be calendars [Rocky Burt]\n\n\n1.0rc1 (2007-07-31)\n-------------------\n\n- Many bug fixes resulting from the Boston 2007 P4A sprint\n\n- #40 - Events not displayed in Month View on Windows IE6. Default install would\n  not display events in IE 6.  Rob Baker supplied fix.\n\n- #39 - Timezone issue when exporting to iCal. Issue is resolved. It was an old\n  version of DateTime.py that caused the trouble. Replacing the file with the new\n  version (available at zope.org) solved the problem.\n\n- #38 - Time formatting for internationalization. P4A Calendar now uses the i18n\n  library to convert the hour/minute format to the locale based on the language\n  of the incoming browser request.  This change removed several methods on the\n  Month class that were formally handling this formatting chore.\n  However, this new code does not have any tests written against it.\n\n- #36 - Event starting in the past, ending in the future is not listed.\n  The submitter of the original bug supplied a patch. The patch was applied to the\n  code base and tested. We concluded that the patch solves this issue.\n\n- #35 - KeyError causes month view to crash\n\n- #34 and #37 - Bug deals with a site breakage when the P4A product is removed\n  from the file system. This occurs after marker interfaces are set on containerish\n  objects. Rocky Burt concluded that this is a core Zope issue and provided a\n  workaround is to remove all marker interfaces for P4A when uninstalling the\n  product via the QuickInstaller. Reinstall does not affect the marker interface\n  settings. The drawback is that if the product is uninstalled all site setting\n  dealing with the calendar will be lost. But it was considered worse to have a\n  product that breaks a site with its removal from the files system. The long term\n  solution will have to come from Zope core.\n\n- #30 - Changing folder back to normal causes error.\n\n- #28 - Events with future month don't show up\n\n\n1.0beta1 (2007-04-29)\n---------------------\n\n- Various bugfixes\n\n\n1.0alpha2 (2007-01-14)\n----------------------\n\n- Fixed bug where URL retrieval was getting the brain's incorrect URL\n  [Lennart Regebro]\n\n- Now has support for setting up a site/portal which means calendaring\n  functionality is only available after this has been performed on the\n  site/portal [Rocky Burt]\n\n- Added support to import iCalendar from a remote URL [Lennart Regebro]\n\n- Added support for add links [Lennart Regebro]\n\n\n1.0alpha1 (2006-10-21)\n----------------------\n\n- First release with unrecorded set of functionality [Rocky Burt]", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/collective/p4a.plonecalendar", "keywords": "Plone4Artists events event calendar calendaring", "license": "GPL", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "p4a.plonecalendar", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/p4a.plonecalendar/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/p4a.plonecalendar/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/collective/p4a.plonecalendar"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/p4a.plonecalendar/2.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Plone4Artists calendar add-on for Plone", "version": "2.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"overview\">\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>p4a.plonecalendar provides nice calendaring views for Plone, specifically\na Month, Week and Day view, and also nice lists of past and previous\nevents.</p>\n<p>There are today better calendaring views for Plone, specifcally solgema.fullcalendar.\nHowever, that\u2019s a JavaScript calendar, so if you need a calendar that you can use\nwithout JavaScript, for example for accessibility reasons, then p4a.plonecalendar\nis a good choice.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"upgrading-from-version-2-0\">\n<h2>Upgrading from version 2.0</h2>\n<p>p4a.plonecalendar 2.1 removes the dependency on p4a.subtyper.

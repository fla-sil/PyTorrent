In the data you need service_name, version and a location. Version is not required and when not passe keyard assumes 1.0\n\n## PUT ##\nThis method is intended for health_check calls. Health check calls are made to inform keyard that a location is still up. \n\nIt uses the same data as post.\n\n## DELETE ##\nA delete will remove a location from keyard. Uses the same data as post\n\n\n# Example #\n\nThere is a example app for you to check. Start an etcd application localhost and\n```\ngunicorn example.keyard_app:app -b 0.0.0.0:8000\ngunicorn example.app2:app -b 0.0.0.0:8002\ngunicorn example.app1:app -b 0.0.0.0:8001\n\ncurl 0.0.0.0:8001/app1\n```\n\nThat curl should return you \"Hello World\"\n\n\n# License #\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015, Raphael Bernardi Zanluchi\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

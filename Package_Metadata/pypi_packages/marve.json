CoreNLP is then used to link measurements to related words in the sentence using word dependencies and POS tags from CoreNLP. Common dependency/POS patterns relating measurements to other words/entities are specified in `/marve/dependency_patterns.json` and can be adjusted without modifying code. \n\n## Installation\n\nRunning Marve requires grobid-quantities and CoreNLP to be running:\n\nDownload and unzip [CoreNLP](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html):\n```shell\ncurl -LOk \"http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-full-2016-10-31.zip\" | unzip <path to CoreNLP>/stanford-corenlp-full-2016-10-31.zip\n```\n\nRun (requires Java 8):\n```shell\ncd <path to CoreNLP>/stanford-corenlp-full-2016-10-31 | java -mx4g -cp \"*\" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer 9000\n```\n\nInstall grobid by following instructions [here](http://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install-Grobid/) </br></br>\nThen follow [grobid-quantities instructions](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid-quantities) to install, build, train, and run\n\nInstall Marve:</br>\n`pip install marve`\n\n## Usage\nOnce both CoreNLP and grobid-quantities are running, Marve can be used as such:\n\n```shell\n# coding: utf-8\n\nfrom marve import Measurements as m\n\n# Strings longer than a paragraph should be split before passing to Marve\n_test = \"The patient returned to Europe at 28 weeks of gestation.\"\n\ncoreNLP = \"http://localhost:9000\"\ngrobid = \"http://localhost:8080\"\npatterns = \"dependency_patterns.json\"\nwrite_to = \"sample_output.txt\"\n\nm.extract(_test, coreNLP, grobid, patterns, write_to, show_graph=False, pretty=True, simplify=False)\n````\n\n(This example can be found in `sample.py`)\n\n<b>IMPORTANT</b>: Text should be in sentence or paragraph chunks before passing to Marve.\n\n<b> Note </b>: The first time Marve is run, a timeout error might be thrown due to longer CoreNLP model loading times. If this happens, run again and CorenLP should run properly.\n\n## Dependency and Part-of-Speech Patterns\nMarve will only return words related to measurements if they meet criteria laid out in the dependency pattern file `/marve/dependency_patterns.json`.\n\nTake the phrase `\"a spatial resolution of 10m\"`. Marve uses a graph to represent each sentence, where edges are the dependencies between words (represented in green ovals below) and nodes are words and their part-of-speech (POS) labels (represented in blue). \n\n![example](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/hundman/marve/blob/master/blob/example.png)\n\nThere are a handful of general patterns that relate measurement units, values, and other related words or entities in a sentence. For instance, units are generally connected to values via the numerical modifier (`\"nummod\"`) dependency (see above). Nominal modifiers (`\"nmod\"`) is then a common dependency linking units to the thing being quantified. Common patterns linking values, units, and related words have been defined in `/marve/dependency_patterns.json`, and the bit of JSON that would match `\"m\"` to `\"resolution\"` in our above example is:\n\n\n```shell\n\"nmod\": {\n    \"enhanced\": true,\n    \"of\":{\n        \"measurement_types\": [\"space_between\", \"attached\"],\n        \"pos_in\":{\n            \"NN\": null\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere's how this example matches:</br></br>\n1. `nmod` is the dependency type between `m` and `resolution`</br></br>\n2. Since we utilized CoreNLP's enhanced dependency parser, we also see `:of` attached on the end of `nmod`. Since enhanced is set to `true`, the `of` must be attached to the dependency</br></br>\n3. Because the measurement is `10m` we identify it as being an `attached` `measurement_type`</br></br>\n4. `\"pos_in\"` forces the part of speech of the attached node to contain at least one of its keys. In this case, \"NN\" means the part of speech must be a noun (valid POS tags could be: `NN`, `NNS`, `NNP`, `NNPS`). Since `NN`'s value is null, we are finished and can return resolution as a related word and add it to the output. For some POS tags such as `VB`, we might need to continue traversing edges in the graph, in which case the value could specify a function to be called (e.g. `get_cousin()`)</br>\n\nAll such dependency patterns listed in the JSON will be evaluated and if there are any matching patters, they will be added as related words for a measurement.\n\n## API\n\n```shell\nextract(content, corenlp, grobid, dependency_patterns_file, output_file=None, show_graph=False, pretty=False, simplify=False)\n\nReturns extracted measurements from a sentence or paragraph.\n\nParameters: \tcontent: string\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSentence or paragraph to extract measurements from.\n\n\t\t\t\tcorenlp: string\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCoreNLP server endpoint (e.g. \"http://localhost:9200\"). \n\n\t\t\t\tgrobid: string\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGrobid server endpoint (e.g. \"http://localhost:8080\").\n\n\t\t\t\tdependency_patterns_file: string\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFilepath to JSON file containing valid dependency/POS patterns for \n\t\t\t\t\t\textracting words and entities related to measurements.\n\n\t\t\t\toutput_file: string, optional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFile to write extracted measurement output to.\n\n\t\t\t\tshow_graph: boolean, optional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf True, a visualization of the dependency and POS network graph \n\t\t\t\t\t\twill be displayed for each sentence parsed.\n\n\t\t\t\tpretty: boolean, optional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf True, JSON written to file will be indented.

In this case, \"NN\" means the part of speech must be a noun (valid POS tags could be: `NN`, `NNS`, `NNP`, `NNPS`). Since `NN`'s value is null, we are finished and can return resolution as a related word and add it to the output. For some POS tags such as `VB`, we might need to continue traversing edges in the graph, in which case the value could specify a function to be called (e.g. `get_cousin()`)&lt;/br&gt;<br><br>All such dependency patterns listed in the JSON will be evaluated and if there are any matching patters, they will be added as related words for a measurement.<br><br>## API<br><br>```shell<br>extract(content, corenlp, grobid, dependency_patterns_file, output_file=None, show_graph=False, pretty=False, simplify=False)<br><br>Returns extracted measurements from a sentence or paragraph.<br><br>Parameters: \tcontent: string<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tSentence or paragraph to extract measurements from.<br><br>\t\t\t\tcorenlp: string<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tCoreNLP server endpoint (e.g. \"http://localhost:9200\"). <br><br>\t\t\t\tgrobid: string<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tGrobid server endpoint (e.g. \"http://localhost:8080\").<br><br>\t\t\t\tdependency_patterns_file: string<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tFilepath to JSON file containing valid dependency/POS patterns for <br>\t\t\t\t\t\textracting words and entities related to measurements.<br><br>\t\t\t\toutput_file: string, optional<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tFile to write extracted measurement output to.<br><br>\t\t\t\tshow_graph: boolean, optional<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tIf True, a visualization of the dependency and POS network graph <br>\t\t\t\t\t\twill be displayed for each sentence parsed.<br><br>\t\t\t\tpretty: boolean, optional<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tIf True, JSON written to file will be indented.

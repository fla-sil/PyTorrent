It assumes that you already have ZFS running\nand vaults on both the machine you're going to back up and the machine that\nwill be receiving the backup.\n\n### On the machine to back up\n\n- Install the zfs-shell command   \n  `cp zfs-shell /usr/local/sbin`  \n  `chmod 755 /usr/local/sbin/zfs-shell`  \n  `chown root.root /usr/local/sbin/zfs-shell`  \n\n- Create a user with a home directory and shell `zfs-shell`  \n  `useradd -rUm -b /var/lib -s /usr/local/sbin/zfs-shell zfs`\n\n- Let `sudo` know that the new user can run the zfs command  \n  `zfs ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/sbin/zfs`  \n  (ensure you remove the `requiretty` default on `/etc/sudoers`)\n  (check `sudoers.zfs-tools` in `contrib/` for an example)\n\n- Set up a cron job to run `zsnap` as frequently as you want to,\n  snapshotting the dataset you intend to replicate.\n\n### On the backup machine\n\n- Set up public key authentication for SSH so the backup machine\n  may log as the user `zfs` (as laid out above) in the machine to\n  be backed up.\n\n- Create a dataset to receive the backup stream.\n\n- Set up a cron job to fetch the dataset snapshotted by zsnap\n  from the remote machine into the newly created dataset.  You\n  will use `zreplicate` for that (see below for examples).\n\n- After the first replication, you may want to set the `mountpoint`\n  attributes on the received datasets so they do not automount\n  on the backup machine.\n\n### Test\n\nIf all went well, you should be able to do this without issue:\n\n(on the machine to back up)\n\n    [root@peter]\n    zsnap senderpool\n\n(on the machine to receive)\n\n    [root@paul]\n    zfs create receiverpool/senderpool # <--- run this ONLY ONCE\n    zreplicate -o zfs@paul:senderpool receiverpool/senderpool\n    # this should send the entire senderpool with all snapshots\n    # over from peter to paul, placing it in receiverpool/senderpool\n\n(on the machine to back up)\n\n    [root@peter]\n    zsnap senderpool\n\n(on the machine to receive)\n\n    [root@paul]\n    zreplicate -o zfs@paul:senderpool receiverpool/senderpool\n    # this should send an incremental stream of senderpool\n    # into receiverpool/senderpool\n\nAnd that's it, really.", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/Rudd-O/zfs-tools", "keywords": "ZFS filesystems backup synchronization snapshot", "license": "GPL", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "zfs-tools", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zfs-tools/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zfs-tools/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://github.com/Rudd-O/zfs-tools"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zfs-tools/0.5.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "ZFS synchronization and snapshotting tools", "version": "0.5.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>ZFS tools</h1>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">Donate to support this free software</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"164\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/ea06563789cef4838dae64166f05b9b47f613910/646f632f626974636f696e2e706e67\" width=\"164\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><a>1Cw9nZu9ygknussPofMWCzmSMveusTbQvN</a></td>\n</tr></tbody></table>\n<p>The ZFS backup tools will help you graft an entire ZFS pool as a filesystem\ninto a backup machine, without having to screw around snapshot names or\ncomplicated shell commands or crontabs.</p>\n<p>The utilities let you do this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>zfs-shell:<br>\na shell that allows remote ZFS administration and nothing more</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>zsnap:<br>\na command that snapshots a dataset or pool, then deletes old snapshots</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>zreplicate<br>\na command that replicates an entire dataset tree using ZFS replication\nstreams.

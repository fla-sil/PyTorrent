However, a method needs to declare parameter in order to receive a signal.\n\nFinally, to build and run an entire program, use the program class:\n\n>   ```buildoutcfg\n>     acq = MyAcquisitionClass()\n>     vis = MyVisualizationClass()\n>     program = Program(acquire=acq, visualize=vis)\n>     program.build()\n>   ```\n\nAny number of primary modules can be instantiated and passed to the \"program\" builder:\nprogram = Program(acquire=<acquisition_module>, analyze=<analysis_module>, visualize=<visualization_module>)\nUpon calling \"program.build()\", signals will be connected and the program is run.\n\n\n##\nFor computational microscopy workflows, there are additionally four datastructures and some microscope control utilities:\n\nFour datastructures:\n- Intensity\n- Stokes\n- Physical\n- Background\n\n## LICENSE\n\nChan Zuckerberg Biohub Software License\n\nThis software license is the 2-clause BSD license plus clause a third clause\nthat prohibits redistribution and use for commercial purposes without further\npermission.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019.

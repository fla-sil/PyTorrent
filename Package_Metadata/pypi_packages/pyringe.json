With pyringe, you can list threads, get tracebacks, inspect locals/globals/builtins of running functions, all without having to prepare your program for it.\n\nWhat this is not\n----------------\n\nA \"Google project\". It's my internship project that got open-sourced. Sorry for the confusion.\n\nWhat do I need?\n---------------\n\nPyringe internally uses gdb to do a lot of its heavy lifting, so you will need a fairly recent build of gdb (version 7.4 onwards, and only if gdb was configured with `--with-python`). You will also need the symbols for whatever build of python you're running.  \nOn Fedora, the package you're looking for is `python-debuginfo`, on Debian it's called `python2.7-dbg` (adjust according to version). Arch Linux users: see [issue #5][].  \nHaving [Colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama) will get you output in boldface, but it's optional.\n\n[issue #5]: https://github.com/google/pyringe/issues/5\n\nHow do I get it?\n----------------\n\nGet it from the [Github repo][], [PyPI][], or via pip (`pip install pyringe`).\n\n[Github repo]: https://github.com/google/pyringe\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyringe\n\nIs this Python3-friendly?\n-------------------------\n\nShort answer: **No, sorry.** Long answer:  \nThere's three potentially different versions of python in play here:  \n1. The version running pyringe  \n2. The version being debugged  \n3. The version of `libpythonXX.so` your build of gdb was linked against  \n\n`2` Is currently the dealbreaker here. Cpython has changed a bit in the meantime[1], and making all features work while debugging python3 will have to take a back seat for now until the more glaring issues have been taken care of.    \nAs for `1` and `3`, the `2to3` tool may be able to handle it automatically. But then, as long as `2` hasn't been taken care of, this isn't really a use case in the first place.\n\n[1] - For example, `pendingbusy` (which is used for injection) has been renamed to `busy` and been given a function-local scope, making it harder to interact with via gdb.\n\nWill this work with PyPy?\n-------------------------\n\nUnfortunately, no. Since this makes use of some CPython internals and implementation details, only CPython is supported. If you don't know what PyPy or CPython are, you'll probably be fine.\n\nWhy not PDB?\n------------\n\nPDB is great. Use it where applicable! But sometimes it isn't.  \nLike when python itself crashes, gets stuck in some C extension, or you want to inspect data without stopping a program. In such cases, PDB (and all other debuggers that run within the interpreter itself) are next to useless, and without pyringe you'd be left with having to debug using `print` statements. Pyringe is just quite convenient in these cases.\n\n\nI injected a change to a local var into a function and it's not showing up!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a known limitation. Things like `inject('var = 2')` won't work, but `inject('var[1] = 1337')` should. This is because most of the time, python internally uses a fast path for looking up local variables that doesn't actually perform the dictionary lookup in `locals()`. In general, code you inject into processes with pyringe is very different from a normal python function call.\n\nHow do I use it?\n----------------\n\nYou can start the debugger by executing `python -m pyringe`. Alternatively:\n\n\n```python\nimport pyringe\npyringe.interact()\n```\n\nIf that reminds you of the code module, good; this is intentional.  \nAfter starting the debugger, you'll be greeted by what behaves almost like a regular python REPL.  \nTry the following:\n\n\n```python\n==> pid:[None] #threads:[0] current thread:[None]\n>>> help()\nAvailable commands:\n attach: Attach to the process with the given pid.\n bt: Get a backtrace of the current position.\n [...]\n==> pid:[None] #threads:[0] current thread:[None]\n>>> attach(12679)\n==> pid:[12679] #threads:[11] current thread:[140108099462912]\n>>> threads()\n[140108099462912, 140108107855616, 140108116248323, 140108124641024, 140108133033728, 140108224739072, 140108233131776, 140108141426432, 140108241524480, 140108249917184, 140108269324032]\n```\n\nThe IDs you see here correspond to what `threading.current_thread().ident` would tell you.  \nAll debugger functions are just regular python functions that have been exposed to the REPL, so you can do things like the following.\n\n```python\n==> pid:[12679] #threads:[11] current thread:[140108099462912]\n>>> for tid in threads():\n...   if not tid % 10:\n...     thread(tid)\n...     bt()\n... \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py\", line 524, in __bootstrap\n    self.__bootstrap_inner()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py\", line 551, in __bootstrap_inner\n    self.run()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py\", line 504, in run\n    self.__target(*self.__args, **self.__kwargs)\n  File \"./test.py\", line 46, in Idle\n    Thread_2_Func(1)\n  File \"./test.py\", line 40, in Wait\n    time.sleep(n)\n==> pid:[12679] #threads:[11] current thread:[140108241524480]\n>>> \n```\n\nYou can access the inferior's locals and inspect them like so:\n\n```python\n==> pid:[12679] #threads:[11] current thread:[140108241524480]\n>>> inflocals()\n{'a': <proxy of A object at remote 0x1d9b290>, 'LOL': 'success!', 'b': <proxy of B object at remote 0x1d988c0>, 'n': 1}\n==> pid:[12679] #threads:[11] current thread:[140108241524480]\n>>> p('a')\n<proxy of A object at remote 0x1d9b290>\n==> pid:[12679] #threads:[11] current thread:[140108241524480]\n>>> p('a').attr\n'Some_magic_string'\n==> pid:[12679] #threads:[11] current thread:[140108241524480]\n>>> \n```\n\nAnd sure enough, the definition of `a`'s class reads:\n\n```python\nclass Example(object):\n  cl_attr = False\n  def __init__(self):\n    self.attr = 'Some_magic_string'\n```\n\nThere's limits to how far this proxying of objects goes, and everything that isn't trivial data will show up as strings (like `'<function at remote 0x1d957d0>'`).  \nYou can inject python code into running programs. Of course, there are caveats but... see for yourself:\n\n```python\n==> pid:[12679] #threads:[11] current thread:[140108241524480]\n>>> inject('import threading')\n==> pid:[12679] #threads:[11] current thread:[140108241524480]\n>>> inject('print threading.current_thread().ident')\n==> pid:[12679] #threads:[11] current thread:[140108241524480]\n>>> \n```\n\nThe output of my program in this case reads:\n\n```\n140108241524480\n```\n\nIf you need additional pointers, just try using python's help (`pyhelp()` in the debugger) on debugger commands.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/google/pyringe", "keywords": null, "license": "Apache License, Version 2.0", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "pyringe", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyringe/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyringe/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/google/pyringe"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyringe/1.0.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Python debugger capable of attaching to processes", "version": "1.0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            **DISCLAIMER: This is not an official google project, this is just something I wrote while at Google.**<br><br>Pyringe<br>=======<br><br>What this is<br>------------<br><br>Pyringe is a python debugger capable of attaching to running processes,  inspecting their state and even of injecting python code into them while they're running.

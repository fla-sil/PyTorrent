The simulation environment is included with\nany purchased source level RTL core. It is being released under the BSD license\nfor use by anyone who would like an easy way to set up and run Verilog\nsimulations.\n\nAt RTLCores_, we wanted a way to run simulations on Mac OSX, Linux and Windows\nthrough a consistent interface. Normally we would just use Make, but using Make\non Windows requires the installation of Cigwin which, while it's a wonderful\ntool, is a pain for some people to deal with. Python, on the other hand, is\nvery easy to install and use on all platforms. There are other reasons to favor\nPython over Make for creating a Verilog simulation environment, but that's a\nmuch longer conversation.\n\nSimShop is a work in progress, as all software is, with new features being\nadded all the time. We at RTLCores_ use it every day with excellent results and\nhope that you will too.\n\nWhy command line\n================\nYou may be wondering why we would choose to run simulations via the command\nline. The answer is that more often than not GUIs are a hindrance.  Running\nsimulations from the command line keeps your environment agnostic, allows the\nuse of simulation grids and makes it much easier to automate various processes.\n\nDocumentation\n=============\nFor information on how to install and use SimShop check out the pretty\ndocumentation_.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/SimShop", "keywords": null, "license": "LICENSE.txt", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "SimShop", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/SimShop/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/SimShop/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/SimShop"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/SimShop/0.15.4/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Easy Verilog simulation", "version": "0.15.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>SimShop is a tool that makes running command line based Verilog simulations\nsimple.</p>\n<p>SimShop is part of the simulation environment used to run baseline simulations\nof cores purchased from <a href=\"http://rtlcores.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">RTLCores</a>.

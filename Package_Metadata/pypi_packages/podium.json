And when they do, they need slide decks.\n\nUnfortunately, while presentation tools like Keynote_ and PowerPoint_\nare great for business presentations, they aren't well suited to the\nneeds of developers. The mainstay of developer presentations -- code\nsamples -- are generally painful to add to a Keynote presentation.\n\nThese presentation tools also come from a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You\nGet) tradition. This can be powerful, because it makes it easy to put\nanything you want onto a slide. But it can also be painful, because you\nend up spending all your time pushing pixels into the right place, instead\nof focussing on the content of your talk. And if you want to make a style\nchange, you may need to apply that change manually to every slide. The lessons\nof separating content from markup can't be applied to a WYSIWYG world.\n\nOn top of all that, the document formats for Keynote and Powerpoint are\nbinary blobs -- they don't lend themselves to version control, collaborative\nediting, and so on.\n\nThe developer response to this has been to use HTML5. Recent years have seen\nthe development of a number of HTML-based presentation tools, like prezi_,\n`deck.js`_, `keydown`_ and `showoff`_. These tools exploit the power of HTML5\nto make full screen presentations.\n\nHowever, by using browser technology as the basis for these tools, they miss one\nvery important feature of WYSIWYG presentation tools: presenter mode.\n\nOne of the big features of Keynote and Powerpoint is that they aren't just\ndecks of slides -- they have presenter notes and timing tools, and the\ndisplay shown to the audience isn't the same as the display shown to the\npresenter.\n\nMany of these tools also assume that you have a good WiFi connection, and will\nbe able to display your content live off the internet... which if you've ever\nbeen to a developer conference, you'll know is a risky proposition.\n\nPodium attempts to bridge the gap between these two poles. It is comprised of:\n\n* A simple, text-based markup format, focussed on the needs of developer\n  presentations.\n* A graphical presentation tool that has a presenter display independent of\n  the slide display.\n\n..

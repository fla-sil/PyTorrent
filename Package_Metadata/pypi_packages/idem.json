It exposes stateful\nprogramming constructs that makes things like enforcing the state\nof an application, configuration, SaaS system, or others very\nsimple.\n\nSince Idem is a programming language, it can also be used for data\nprocessing and pipelining. Idem can be used not only to manage\nthe configuration of interfaces, but also for complex rule engines\nand processing files or workflows.\n\nIdem is a language to glue together management of all sorts of\ninterfaces. You can think of it like having idempotent\nscripts. Automation that can be run over and over again that\nenforces a specific state or process.\n\nIdem is unique in that it is built purely as a language. It\ncan be added to any type of management system out there and can\nbe applied in a cross platform way easily.\n\nIdem's functionality can also be expanded easily. Instead of storing\nall of the language components in a single place, the libraries\nused by Idem can be written independently and seamlessly merged\ninto Idem, just like a normal programming language!\n\nWhat does Idempotent mean?\n==========================\n\nThe concept of Idempotent is simple! It just means that every time\nsomething is run, it always has the same end result regardless of the state\nof a system when the run starts!\n\nAt first glance this might seem useless, but think more deeply. Have you\never needed to make sure that something was set up in a consistent way? It\ncan be very nice to be able to enforce that setup without worrying about\nbreaking it. Or think about data pipelines, have you ever had input data\nthat needed to be processed? Idempotent systems allow for data to be\neasily processed in a consistent way, over and over again!\n\nHow Does This Language Work?\n============================\n\nIdem is built using two critical technologies, `Python` and `POP`. Since Idem\nis built on Python it should be easy to extend for most software developers.\nExtending Idem can be very easy because simple Python modules are all you need\nto add capabilities!\n\nThe other technology, `POP`, may be new to you. This is the truly secret sauce\nbehind Idem as well as a number of emerging exciting technologies. `POP` stands\nfor Plugin Oriented Programming. It is the brainchild of `the creator of\nSalt <https://github.com/thatch45>`_ and a new way to write software. The `POP`\nsystem makes the creation of higher level paradigms like Idem possible, but also\nprovides the needed components to make Idem extensible and flexible. If `POP`\nis a new concept to you,\n`check it out <https://pop.readthedocs.io>`_!\n\nIdem works by taking language files called `sls` files and compiling them\ndown to data instructions. These data instructions are then run through the\nIdem runtime. These instructions inform Idem what routines to call to\nenforce state or process data. It allows you to take a high level dataset\nas your input, making the use of the system very easy.\n\nParadigms and Languages, This Sounds Complicated!\n=================================================\n\nUnder the hood, it is complicated! The guts of a programming language are\ncomplicated, but it is all there to make your life easier! You don't need to\nunderstand complex computer science theory to benefit from Idem. You just need\nto learn a few simple things and you can start making your life easier today!\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/x-rst", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://idem.readthedocs.io", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "idem", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/idem/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/idem/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://idem.readthedocs.io"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/idem/6/", "requires_dist": ["PyYaml", "wheel", "jinja2", "pop (>=12)", "rend (>=4.2)", "toml", "takara"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Transform configuration into idempotent action.", "version": "6", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>Idem is an idempotent dataflow programming language.

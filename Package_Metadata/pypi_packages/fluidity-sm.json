These params can be method names (as strings),\ncallables, or lists of method names or callables.\n\n\nTransitions\n-----------\n\nTransitions lead the machine from a state to another. Transitions must have\n*from\\_*, *to*, and *action* parameters. *from\\_* is one or more (as list) states\nfrom which the transition can be started. *to* is the state to which the\ntransition will lead the machine. *event* is the method that have to be called\nto launch the transition. This method is automatically created by the Fluidity\nengine.\n\nA transition can have optional *action* and *guard* parameters. *action* is a\nmethod (or callable) that will be called when transition is launched. If\nparameters are passed to the event method, they are passed to the *action*\nmethod, if it accepts these parameters. *guard* is a method (or callable) that\nis called to allow or deny the transition, depending on the result of its\nexecution. Both \"action\" and *guard* can be lists.\n\nThe same event can be in multiple transitions, going to different states, having\ntheir respective guards as selectors. For the transitions having the same event,\nonly one guard should return a true value at a time.\n\n\nIndividuation\n-------------\n\nStates and transitions are defined in a class-wide mode. However, one can define\nstates and transitions for individual objects. For example, having \"door\" as a\nstate machine::\n\n    door.add_state('broken')\n    door.add_transition(from_='closed', event='crack', to='broken')\n\n\nThese additions only affect the target object.\n\n\nHow to install\n--------------\n\nJust run::\n\n    pip install fluidity-sm\n\n\n**Note**: the Pypi package is called *fluidity-sm*, not *fluidity*.\n\n\nHow to run tests\n----------------\n\nJust run::\n\n    make test\n\nfor install all test dependencies (`Should-DSL <http://www.should-dsl.info>`_\nand `Specloud <https://github.com/hugobr/specloud>`_, at the moment) and\nrun the tests.

It makes integration testing with Plone much faster.\r\n\r\nCurrently it is focused around preloading a Plone environment but it could\r\nalso work for other frameworks as well.\r\n\r\nIt works by pre-loading Python code, setup of test layers and a default Plone\r\nsite. This is called the resident test environment.\r\n\r\nYour tests are run in a child process which gets a copy-on-write memory space.\r\n\r\nOther than that it pretty much works like the regular Zope testrunner.\r\n\r\nHow much faster is it?\r\n======================\r\n\r\nHere's an example. You are writing integration or functional tests for a Plone\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nOn this fairly current laptop it takes 25s to load Zope, Plone and setup a\r\nsample Plone site.\r\n\r\nAdd 5 seconds for the application load and test run for a total of 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nIf you are iterating on a functional test and want to quickly check your\r\nchanges that is too long to wait.\r\n\r\nUsing roadrunner you load the environment the first time.  Subsequent times\r\nyou run your test your total time will be only 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nYes, you can save 25 seconds every time you run your test.\r\n\r\nHow to use it?\r\n==============\r\n\r\nRoadrunner only currently works as part of a zc.buildout environment.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to try it is to add it to an existing Plone 3 buildout.\r\n\r\nNow for a sample part.\r\n\r\nThis will create a new directory in parts named by the part containing a copy\r\nof your Zope instance environment but with the packages-under-test excluded\r\nfrom being loaded via ZCML by default.\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n  [roadrunner]\r\n  recipe = roadrunner:plone\r\n  packages-under-test = my.package\r\n  \r\nYou can also match several packages using simple globbing, eg: my.packages.*\r\n\r\nThe parameter 'zope2-instance' allows you to specify the name of the part\r\nwhich corresponds to the zope instance roadrunner will work against.  The\r\ndefault is 'instance'.\r\n\r\nBy default resident Plone site will be created. This should work in most\r\nsituations where you are installing add-on products that use install methods\r\nor GenericSetup profiles.\r\n\r\nsetup-plone=0 allows you to disable the Plone site setup optimization. You\r\nmight need to do this in certain situations where you are using the profile_id\r\nparameter.\r\n\r\nThen you can run roadrunner::\r\n\r\n  $ bin/roadrunner -s my.package\r\n  \r\nIt will preload Zope & Plone, then fork off the first testrunner. Once the\r\nfirst testrunner is complete you will receive the roadrunner prompt where\r\nyou launch additional tests.\r\n\r\nRecipe Options\r\n==============\r\n\r\nzope2-instance:\r\n\r\nThe zope2 instance to use for basing the installation on. Defaults \r\nto 'instance'.\r\n\r\nGotchas\r\n=======\r\n\r\n- roadrunner is still a bit experimental. If in doubt, check it with the\r\n  regular testrunner. If you find a difference please send some details\r\n  including traceback, product versions, buildout.cfg and your tests.\r\n\r\n- It may require you to change your test setup slightly if you haven't yet\r\n  already.\r\n\r\n  You'll be fine as long as you follow the standard sequence of importing your\r\n  product, loading its ZCML and then calling ztc.installProduct within an\r\n  @onsetup deferred method.\r\n  \r\n   This allows the loading of your product to occur in the child testrunner\r\n  process which critical that roadrunner does what its supposed to do.\r\n\r\n  For more details see an example here:\r\n\r\n    http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/testing/writing-a-plonetestcase-unit-integration-test\r\n  \r\n- Because it preloads the Plone environment you won't be able to see changes\r\n  to the Core Plone components.  However, it should see all changes in your\r\n  application code which is what you will most likely be changing anyways.\r\n\r\nOther options to speed up Plone testing\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nplone.reload is excellent to do exploratory testing and development.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n============\r\n\r\n- ZCML registrations lost.  This can occur if you run unit tests which employ\r\nPlacelessSetup.  A simple workaround is to avoid running unit tests and\r\nintegration tests together with roadrunner.  You can run them separately\r\nwithout issue.\r\n\r\nSource & Bug Tracker\r\n====================\r\n\r\nSource Code:\r\n\r\n  http://github.com/hexsprite/roadrunner\r\n\r\nTracker:\r\n\r\n  http://hexsprite.lighthouseapp.com/projects/21973-roadrunner\r\n\r\nTested With\r\n===========\r\n\r\nPlone 3.1.x Let me know if you get it working on anything else.\r\n\r\nHave also had reports of success with Plone 2.5.x\r\n\r\nAlso there are reports of success with Zope 2.9.8 and Plone 2.5.5.\r\n\r\nWindows is untested and probably does not work currently.

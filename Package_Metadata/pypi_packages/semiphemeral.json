It also lets you manually select tweets you'd like to exclude from deleting.\n\n~~It can also automatically delete your old direct messages.~~ (DM support is [coming soon](https://github.com/micahflee/semiphemeral/issues/29).)\n\n_Read more in the blog post: [Semiphemeral: Automatically delete your old tweets, except for the ones you want to keep](https://micahflee.com/2019/06/semiphemeral-automatically-delete-your-old-tweets-except-for-the-ones-you-want-to-keep/)_\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```\npip3 install semiphemeral\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nSemiphemeral is a command line tool that you run locally on your computer, or on a server.\n\n```\n$ semiphemeral\nUsage: semiphemeral [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n  Automatically delete your old tweets, except for the ones you want to keep\n\nOptions:\n  --help  Show this message and exit.\n\nCommands:\n  configure  Start the web server to configure semiphemeral\n  delete     Delete tweets that aren't automatically or manually excluded\n  fetch      Download all tweets\n  stats      Show stats about tweets in the database\n```\n\nStart by running `semiphemeral configure`, which starts a local web server at http://127.0.0.1:8080/. Load that website in a browser.\n\nYou must supply Twitter API credentials here, which you can get by following [this guide](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html). Basically, you need to login to https://developer.twitter.com/ and create a new \"Twitter app\" that only you will be using (when creating an app, you're welcome to use https://github.com/micahflee/semiphemeral as the website URL for your app).\n\nFrom the settings page you also tell semiphemeral which tweets to exclude from deletion:\n\n![Settings](/img/settings.png)\n\nOnce you have configured semiphemeral, fetch all of the tweets from your account by running `semiphemeral fetch`. (It may take a long time if you have a lot of tweets -- when semiphemeral hits a Twitter rate limit, it just waits the shortest amount of time allowed until it can continue fetching.)\n\nThen go back to the configuration web app and look at the tweets page. From here, you can look at all of the tweets that are going to get deleted the next time you run `semiphemeral delete`, and choose to manually exclude some of them from deletion. This interface paginates all of the tweets that are staged for deletion, and allows you to filter them by searching for phrases in the text of your tweets.\n\nOnce you have chosen all tweets you want to exclude, you may want to [download your Twitter archive](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive) for your records.\n\nThen run `semiphemeral delete` (this also fetches latest tweets before deleting). The first time it might take a long time. Like with fetching, it will wait when it hits a Twitter rate limit. Let it run once first before automating it.\n\nAfter you have manually deleted once, you can automatically delete your old tweets by running `semiphemeral delete` once a day in a cron job.\n\nSettings are stored in `~/.semiphemeral/settings.json`. All tweets (including exceptions, and deleted tweets) are stored in a sqlite database `~/.semiphemeral/tweets.db`.\n\n## Deleting old likes\n\nThe Twitter API is only willing to tell you about your last 4000 likes. If you've already tried to fetch and delete your likes, but still have a lot of old likes, you can use semiphemeral to automate unliking them.\n\n_**WARNING: One does not simply unlike old tweets.** Twitter works in mysterious ways. For some reason, even though these old tweets are listed in your like history, the API doesn't believe that you actually liked them. The only way to remove them from your like history is to LIKE THEM AGAIN, and then you can unlike them, and they actually get removed from your like history, and your like count goes down. But this is VERY NOISY. Every time you re-like a tweet, the user will get a notification. If you need to unlike many thousands of old likes, expect messages from friends thinking your Twitter account was hacked or something._\n\n_**WARNING: Prepare to spend WEEKS running this command.** Twitter only allows users to like up to 1000 tweets per day. This means that if you need to unlike 15,000 old tweets, then this script will take 15 days to run! After the first 1000 like/unlikes, the script will pause for 24 hours. If possible, I recommend you run this on a server in a screen or tmux session, so that it doesn't get interrupted when you suspend your laptop. And if you're running semiphemeral on a cron job, I recommend that you disable it first, and then start it up again when it's finished._\n\nIn order to get a list of all of your old likes (since the Twitter API won't give it to you), you must go to https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data and download your Twitter data (note that this is different than your \"Twitter archive\", which doesn't include information about your likes). Twitter will email you a link to a zip file. When you unzip it there will be many files, including a file called `like.js`. Run this command, with the path to your `like.js`, for example:\n\n```sh\nsemiphemeral unlike --filename ~/Downloads/twitter-2019-06-07-8195574bc935602c0056aee12fb11de78553835ace755eb782c895283f7fa14e/like.js\n```\n\nYour filename will be different than this one, so make sure you update the command to match it.\n\nThis will fetch all of the old tweets you liked a long time ago, and then relike and unlike each one of them. Every relike will cause a notification, but at the end of the process your likes will have actually been deleted. If the command crashes or you cancel in the middle for any reason, it's safe to run it again to continue where you left off.\n\nNew likes don't have this problem, so as long as you regularly run `semiphemeral delete`, your new likes will automatically get deleted.\n\n## Development\n\nMake sure you have [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Then install dependencies:\n\n```sh\npipenv install --dev\n```\n\nAnd run the program like this:\n\n```sh\npipenv run python ./app.py --help\n```\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/micahflee/semiphemeral", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "semiphemeral", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/semiphemeral/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/semiphemeral/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/micahflee/semiphemeral"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/semiphemeral/0.5/", "requires_dist": ["click", "colorama", "tweepy", "flask", "sqlalchemy"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Automatically delete your old tweets, except for the ones you want to keep", "version": "0.5", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p><img alt=\"Logo\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/3e6267c4f94a92828421349006cdd529f265575e/2f696d672f6c6f676f2d736d616c6c2e706e67\"></p>\n<h1>Semiphemeral</h1>\n<p>There are plenty of tools that let you make your Twitter feed ephemeral, automatically deleting tweets older than some threshold, like one month.</p>\n<p>Semiphemeral does this, but also lets you automatically exclude tweets based on criteria: how many RTs or likes they have, and if they're part of a thread where one of your tweets has that many RTs or likes.

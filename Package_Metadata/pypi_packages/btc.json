(Powered by [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/).)\n\n\n## Why Coinbase?\n\n[Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/) is a great bitcoin exchange because:\n\n- They allow you to immediately add and verify a US bank account (this allows\n  you to easily purchase and sell bitcoin without the hassle that other\n  providers make you go through).\n- They have a clean, simple website that makes using bitcoin a nice experience.\n- They are backed by an incredible team of investors (see:\n  https://coinbase.com/about).\n\n**NOTE**: I am in no way affiliated with Coinbase.  I don't know anyone that\nworks there, have no relationship with the investing companies -- nothing.\n\n\n## Why btc?\n\nI spend a lot of my time at the terminal, and I greatly prefer using the command\nline to buy, sell, and transfer bitcoin as it's a lot quicker than opening web\npages, navigating around, etc.\n\nUsing [Coinbase's API](https://coinbase.com/api/doc) was a logical next step for\nme, as I could do everything I'd normally do through coinbase through a simple\nCLI tool, `btc`.\n\nWhy should you use `btc`?  You should use `btc` if:\n\n- You frequently buy / sell / transfer bitcoin.\n- You use Coinbase.\n- You prefer to use open source software to ensure your bitcoin are safe (anyone\n  can view this project code).\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore using `btc`, there are a few things you should already have setup.\n\n1. You should be familiar with bitcoin...  *Duh!*\n2. You should have a coinbase account.  If you don't, you can create one here:\n   https://coinbase.com/\n3. You should add a valid US bank account to your coinbase account if you plan\n   on purchasing or selling bitcoin.  If you only plan on using `btc` to\n   transfer bitcoin from one account to another, this is not necessary.\n4. You should create a coinbase API key.  This is what you will need below so\n   that the `btc` program knows how to access your account.  You can do this\n   here: https://coinbase.com/account/integrations\n\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `btc` via [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/):\n\n```bash\n$ sudo pip install btc\n```\n\nOnce `btc` has been installed, you'll need to give it your coinbase API key so\nit knows how to make requests.  You can find your coinbase API key here:\nhttps://coinbase.com/account/integrations (make sure your API key is\n*enabled*).\n\n```bash\n$ btc init\n```\n\nThe `init` command will ask you for input, and walk you through the making sure\nthat `btc` is working properly.  Your API key will be stored in a file named\n`~/.btc` in your home directory.  To remove your API key from `btc`, simply\ndelete that file.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you simply run `btc` on the command line, you'll get a list of help.\n\n```bash\n$ btc init      # activate btc by supplying your coinbase API key\n$ btc address   # list your active bitcoin address for receiving money\n$ btc balance   # list your account balance\n$ btc request <btc> <email> [<note>]\n                # send a payment request to the specified email address\n$ btc send <btc> (<email> | <address>) [<note>]\n                # send bitcoin to a person by email address or bitcoin address\n$ btc test      # test your API key\n$ btc logs      # display a list of recent transaction logs\n$ btc rates     # show current exchange rates\n$ btc buy 1.5   # purchase 1.5 bitcoin using your bank account on file\n$ btc sell 1.5  # sell 1.5 bitcoin\n$ btc -h        # display help information\n```\n\nAll commands that have side effects will prompt you for confirmation before\ndoing anything for added security (so you don't accidentally spend tons of\nmoney, or something).\n\n\n## Changelog\n\nv0.3: 04-18-2013\n\n    - Setting ~/.btc to mode 0600 for additional security.\n\nv0.2: 04-17-2013\n\n    - Fixing some small documentation issues.\n\nv0.1: 04-17-2013\n\n    - First release!\n\n\n## Like This?\n\nIf you've enjoyed using `btc`, feel free to send me some bitcoin!

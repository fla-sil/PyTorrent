This  assumption,  known  as  the Distributional  Hypothesis, suggests that a corpus is often constituted bys everal  discursive  contexts;  each  one  being  a  set  of  extended  linguistic environments,  conveying  similar/related  concepts  and  topics.   Although this  theory  emerged  in  linguistics  in  1954,  it  received  recently  an  in-creasing attention in many other fields such as in cognitive sciences (e.g.,[McDonald and Ramscar, 2001]),  and  natural  language  processing  (e.g.,[Mikolov et al., 2013a]).  This hypothesis is the founding principle of our approach. Our method aims at modeling a large corpus, as a set of so-called DP-discourses, and then studying them as prototypical speeches.  To do so, the core step,  consists in building clusters of words sharing similar dis-cursive contexts.  This was achieved using word-embedding and subspace clustering, but other data-mining techniques could be used.  Then, intra-cluster  words  were  represented  asDendrogram  Prototypical  Discourses(DP-discourses), using a hierarchical clustering algorithm.  Finally, DP-discourses revealed to be comprehensible enough, to be studied using Charaudeau\u2019s methodology, and they could possibly be analyzed using other discourse analysis approaches.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe easiest way to install the generator is using `pip` the package installer for Python.\nTyping the command:\n\n`pip install DPD`\n\n## Tutorial\n\nCheck the jupyter notebook tutorial `tutorials/tutorial1.ipynb` for a basic usage illustration\n\n## License\n\nThis project is under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (Version 3, 29 June 2007)\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "DPD", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/DPD/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/DPD/", "project_urls": null, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/DPD/0.0.3/", "requires_dist": ["pandas", "numpy", "nltk", "gensim", "sklearn", "scipy", "matplotlib"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Dendrogram Prototypical Discourse generator", "version": "0.0.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Dendrogram Prototypical Discourse Analysis</h1>\n<p>According to [Harris, 1954] and [Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965], words in natural languages are structured within linguistic environments (e.g.,sentences, paragraphs), and in this context, words having similar meanings,  tend  to  share  similar  contexts.

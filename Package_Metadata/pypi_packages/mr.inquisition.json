Other projects start with a Plone site already in place.\n\nIn these situations it is often a big surprise what you are going to\nhave to deal with. Especially when migrating a site from one Plone\nversion to another. Typical questions are:\n\n* What type of objects can I expect?\n\n* What is the number of objects for type X?\n\n* Where does most of the content live?\n\n* Are there objects left of products that were once installed?\n\nMr.inquisition helps to get answers to these questions. This package has been\ntested on Plone versions 2.5 and 3.x.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nWhen you are using zc.buildout, the installation is quite simple. All you\nneed to do is make sure the ``mr.inquisition`` package is listed in the\n``eggs`` option of your Zope 2 instance or zeoclient, e.g.::\n\n  [instance]\n  ...\n  eggs =\n      ...\n      mr.inquisition\n\nOn Plone 3.2 you will need to add it to the ``zcml`` option too, on\nlater Plone versions this is automated::\n\n  [instance]\n  ...\n  zcml =\n      mr.inquisition\n\nThat's it.\n\nIf you want to use mr.inquisition on a site that doesn't use buildout or eggs,\nyou can also copy the ``inquisition`` folder from the mr.inquisition egg to the\n``Products`` directory op your instance.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThe mr.inquisition package offers a number of views which allow you to\ngain insight in the ZODB at hand. Your best bet is to start with the\n``@@inquisition`` view. This view lists all the options you've got.\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\n* `Mark van Lent <https://www.vlent.nl/about>`_\n  (Zest Software) initiated this package.\n\n* `Fred van Dijk <http://zestsoftware.nl/about-us/our-team/fred>`_ and `Maurits\n  van Rees <http://zestsoftware.nl/about-us/our-team/maurits>`_ (both also from\n  Zest Software) came up with the idea and wrote the original version.\n\n* `Vincent Pretre <http://zestsoftware.nl/about-us/our-team/vincent>`_ (again:\n  Zest Software) assisted me with the depth first search to show the content and\n  their (accumulated) size.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.2 (2015-08-04)\n----------------\n\n- Load the CMFCore zcml so we can use the permissions.  This avoids a\n  possible startup error on Plone 4.\n  [maurits]\n\n- Added ``z3c.autoinclude``-entrypoint to mark this as a Plone-plugin.\n  This avoids the need to explicitly load the zcml-slug.\n  [WouterVH]\n\n- Move the repository to the Plone Collective repository.

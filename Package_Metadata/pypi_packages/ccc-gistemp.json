INTRODUCTION\n\nThis is release 0.6.1 of the Clear Climate Code GISTEMP project\n(ccc-gistemp).\n\nClear Climate Code have reimplemented GISTEMP (the GISS surface\ntemperature analysis system), to make it clearer.  Work continues\ntowards making it more clear and more accessible.\n\nccc-gistemp release 0.6.1 is a release of ccc-gistemp version 0.6.\nThe purpose of version 0.6 is to make ccc-gistemp more useful by:\n  - allowing more flexible choices of input data.  For example: GHCN v3;\n    USHCN only; ocean only.\n  - allowing a land mask to be used in the step where land and ocean\n    data are combined.\n  - making use on NumPy array.\n  - adding a setup.py\n\nIn addition there are various bug fixes and improvements to clarity.\n\nChanges since earlier releases are described in more detail in\nrelease-notes.txt.\n\nURLs for further information:\n\nhttp://clearclimatecode.org/ Clear Climate Code website and blog.\nhttp://ccc-gistemp.googlecode.com/ ccc-gistemp code repository.\n\n\n2. DEPENDENCIES\n\nYou need Python and a machine that can run it, and a network\nconnection; there are no explicit operating system or CPU architecture\ndependencies so \"any\" operating system or CPU should be okay.\n\nPython comes in several versions.  We recommend Python 2.6 or Python\n2.7, but ccc-gistemp should work on any version of Python from the\n2.x branch (since 2.4).  It will not work with Python 3.x (which\npython.org calls \"shiny new thing\").  Support for Python 2.4 (and\nto some extent 2.5) remains fragile, and it has caused some problems\nin the past.\n\nThe code should run on OS X, FreeBSD, Windows, and probably a variety of\nother Unix-like operating systems.\n\nA network connection is required to download the input files (which\nneed only be done once), and to display an optional graph from the\nresults.  If you use a proxy to access the internet then Python requires\nthat the \"http_proxy\" environment variable is set.  The proxy will need\nto handle both HTTP and FTP requests (this seems to cause some trouble,\nsee \"INPUT DATA\" below for downloading data by hand).\n\nPython may already be installed on your machine (for example, it comes\npre-installed on OS X), it may be possible to install it using your\noperating system's package manager; for Windows you can download an\ninstaller from http://www.python.org/download/ .  We recommend you use a\nstable production release from the Python 2.x series (Python 3.x will\nnot work).\n\n\n3. INSTALLATION\n\nUnpack ccc-gistemp-0.6.1.tar.gz.\n\n\n4. INPUT DATA\n\nccc-gistemp uses input data in the subdirectory input/.  This\ninput data includes large files (a few megabytes to a few dozen\nmegabytes) of temperature records from GHCN, USHCN, and sea surface\ndata, and small files of additional temperature records and station\ntables from GISS.  ccc-gistemp includes code (tool/preflight.py)\nto fetch this data from the originating organisations over the\ninternet.  It will not download a file if it is already present in\nthe input/ directory, so if you wish to run ccc-gistemp with updated\ninput data, you can delete the input/ directory before you start.\n\nDownloading the input data is a common causes of problems.  Maintaining\nthe part of the code that does this (which has nothing to do with the\ncore GISTEMP algorithm) is a significant cost.  If the tools\nwe provide do not seem to download the input data correctly, you can\ndownload the data \"by hand\" and install it in the input/ directory.  See\ndoc/input.txt for more details.\n\n\n5. RUNNING\n\nTo run ccc-gistemp:\n\n    python tool/run.py\n\nThat command runs steps 0 through 5.  To run only a single step or a shorter\nsequence of steps, use the -s argument.  For instance:\n\n    python tool/run.py -s 3         # Runs just step 3\n    python tool/run.py -s 0-3,5     # Runs steps 0,1,2,3,5 (omitting 4)\n\nWe use this directory structure:\n\nccc-gistemp-x.x.x/code/     Source code for the GISTEMP algorithm only\n                 /config/   Configuration files\n                 /doc/      Internal developer documentation\n                 /input/    Input data files\n                 /log/      Log files\n                 /tool/     Tools - sources other than the GISTEMP algorithm\n                 /work/     Intermediate data files\n                 /result/   Final result files\n\nRunning the code should write to the input/ directory when fetching\ninput data, but subsequently only write to the work/ log/ and result/\ndirectories.  Before running tool/run.py, these directories can all be\ndeleted (if you wish, for example, to have a clean run).\n\nIn 2011 a complete run takes about 35 minutes on an Amazon EC2 \"High-CPU\nMedium Instance\" which is a bit faster than the sorts of not-very-impressive\nmachines that the developers use.  If you want this to go much\nfaster we recommend that you run using PyPy (an alternate implementation\nof Python http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/ ).  See this note\nfrom Paul Ollis:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/ccc-gistemp-discuss/browse_thread/thread/cb0409e770820680\n\n\n6. RESULTS\n\nAfter running run.py, the GISTEMP result files are all in the result/\ndirectory.  A simple graphical chart is made using the Google Chart\nAPI; this file:\n\n    result/google-chart.url\n\ncontains the URL of a chart showing the global annual mean surface\ntemperature anomaly.\n\nIf you have the results of two separate runs in two different\ndirectories, old-result/ and new-result/ , then an HTML report comparing\nthe two can be generated with this command:\n\n    python tool/compare_results.py --labela=old --labela=new old-result new-result\n\nThis will produce a file called index.html in the current directory,\nincluding various statistical comparisons of the two result files.\n\n\n7. REGRESSION TESTING\n\nTo test ccc-gistemp against GISTEMP:\n\n    python tool/regression.py\n\nThis will fetch a tarball from\nhttp://ccc-gistemp.googlecode.com/files/ccc-gistemp-test-2009-12-28.tar.gz\nand uncompress it to a local directory ccc-gistemp-test-2009-12-28/.\nThis contains input files and result data kindly provided to the\nccc-gistemp project by Dr Reto Ruedy of NASA GISS, from an actual run\nof GISTEMP at GISS on 2009-12-28.  Once the tarball is fetched and\nunpacked, the local ccc-gistemp code will be run on it and the results\ncompared, generating a report in index.html.\n\nNote that there are indeed some changes between the results of the\nreference run and 0.4.1 (and subsequent versions), mainly caused\nby a change to the GISTEMP algorithm, for rural/urban station\ndistinction, made at GISS since the reference run.  We have replicated\nthat change in ccc-gistemp (see\nhttp://ccc-gistemp.googlecode.com/issues/detail?id=54).  To test\nccc-gistemp running the same algorithm as the reference GISTEMP\nrun, edit code/parameters.py to set use_global_brightness = False\nbefore running tool/regression.py.\n\n\nA.

To install Yota just do:\n\n+ pip install yota jinja2\n\nOr you can install it from Git with:\n\n+ git clone https://github.com/icook/yota.git\n+ cd yota\n+ pip install .\n+ pip install jinja2\n\nLicense\n================\n\nYota is under the new-style BSD license.\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/icook/yota", "keywords": null, "license": "LICENSE", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "yota", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/yota/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/yota/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/icook/yota"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/yota/0.2.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A form library with a focus on simplicity", "version": "0.2.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/icook/yota\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"https://travis-ci.org/icook/yota.png?branch=master\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/9533ecda2ce0a6ed80800d94bdb118245a76927e/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f69636f6f6b2f796f74612e706e673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://coveralls.io/r/icook/yota?branch=master\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"https://coveralls.io/repos/icook/yota/badge.png?branch=master\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/e584544c3267c780c9ba9f451487bd83b52e346a/68747470733a2f2f636f766572616c6c732e696f2f7265706f732f69636f6f6b2f796f74612f62616467652e706e673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a>\n<div id=\"yota\">\n<h2>Yota</h2>\n<h2 id=\"documentation-example-repository-demo\"><span class=\"section-subtitle\"><a href=\"https://yota.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Documentation</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/icook/yota_examples\" rel=\"nofollow\">Example Repository</a> | <a href=\"http://64.49.234.90/yota_example\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demo</a></span></h2>\n<p>Yota is a Python form generation library with the following unique features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy integration of realtime validation.

Using cmake, from within a check-out::\r\n\r\n  cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=\"-O2\" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\"/usr/local\" -DENABLE_DOUBLE=OFF\r\n  make\r\n\r\nThis will result in libc_speech_features.so and libc_speech_features_static.a being built (or platform equivalents), which you can link in your project. An install target is also provided, allowing system-wide use of the library, but this is not recommended.\r\n\r\nRefer to c_speech_features.h for documentation.\r\n\r\nBindings\r\n--------\r\n\r\nPython\r\n~~~~~~\r\n\r\nBuilding python bindings requires SWIG (http://www.swig.org/) and numpy (http://www.numpy.org/). Run::\r\n\r\n  python setup.py install\r\n\r\nThis will build and install the statically linked c_speech_features module, which can then be used in any python script. Refer to python/test/test.py to see examples of its use. For the most part, it is a drop-in replacement for python_speech_features.\r\n\r\nDifferences to python_speech_features\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n* c_speech_features only supports one datatype, which is defined at compile-time. Currently, this can be either 32-bit (float), or 64-bit (double). python_speech_features operates in 64-bit by default.\r\n* The `winfunc` parameter is an array instead of a function, and is expected to be as wide as necessary depending on context.\r\n\r\nUses\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nIt is not recommended to replace python_speech_features with c_speech_features in a Python context. python_speech_features is safer and will output better error messages when fed with incorrect parameters. c_speech_features is most likely to crash in such situations. On the other hand, this module can be useful to debug issues when using c_speech_features in more appropriate contexts, or if you have very specific needs. c_speech_features is likely to perform faster when compiled with optimisation than python_speech_features. In 64-bit, the gains are minimal, except for particular functions, where as in 32-bit the gains can be substantial (at the cost of precision).", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "c_speech_features", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/c_speech_features/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/c_speech_features/", "project_urls": null, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/c_speech_features/0.4.8/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "", "version": "0.4.8", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>This library is a complete port of python_speech_features (<a href=\"https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features</a>) to C.</p>\n<div id=\"usage\">\n<h2>Usage</h2>\n<p>Clone this repository in your C/C++ project:</p>\n<pre>git clone https://github.com/cwiiis/c_speech_features\n</pre>\n<p>and add these files to your build:</p>\n<pre>c_speech_features.c\nkiss_fft130/kiss_fft.c\nkiss_fft130/tools/kiss_fftr.c\n</pre>\n<p>Alternatively, you can build shared and static libraries to use with your project instead of importing the files directly.

The tests will be run from the undercloud therefore Tempest should\nbe installed and configured on the undercloud node. It's assumed that the Unix\nuser running the tests, generally *stack*, has SSH access to all the compute\nnodes running in the overcloud.\n\nMost tests have specific hardware requirements. These are documented in the\ntests themselves and the tests should fast-fail if these hardware requirements\nare not met. You will require multiple nodes to run these tests and will need\nto manually specify which test to run on which node. For more information on\nour plans here, refer to :ref:`roadmap`.\n\nFor more information on TripleO/Director, refer to the `Red Hat OpenStack\nPlatform documentation`__.\n\n__ https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/11/html/director_installation_and_usage/chap-introduction\n\nInstall, configure and run\n--------------------------\n\n1. Install the plugin.\n\n   This should be done from source. ::\n\n     WORKSPACE=/some/directory\n     cd $WORKSPACE\n     git clone https://github.com/redhat-openstack/whitebox-tempest-plugin\n     sudo pip install whitebox-tempest-plugin\n\n2. Configure Tempest.\n\n   Add the following lines at the end of your ``tempest.conf`` file. These\n   determine how your undercloud node, which is running Tempest, should connect\n   to the compute nodes in the overcloud and vice versa. For example::\n\n     [whitebox]\n     hypervisors = compute-0.localdomain:192.168.24.6,compute-1.localdomain:192.168.24.12\n     # Only set the following if different from the defaults listed\n     # ctlplane_ssh_username = heat-admin\n     # ctlplane_ssh_private_key_path = /home/stack/.ssh/id_rsa\n     containers = true\n     max_compute_nodes = 2 # Some tests depend on there being a single\n                           # (available) compute node\n\n3. Execute the tests. ::\n\n     tempest run --regex whitebox_tempest_plugin.\n\nHow to add a new test\n---------------------\n\nNew tests should be added to the ``whitebox_tempest_plugin/tests`` directory.\n\nAccording to the plugin interface doc__, you should mainly import \"stable\" APIs\nwhich usually are:\n\n* ``tempest.lib.*``\n* ``tempest.config``\n* ``tempest.test_discover.plugins``\n* ``tempest.common.credentials_factory``\n* ``tempest.clients``\n* ``tempest.test``\n\nImporting classes from ``tempest.api.*`` could be dangerous since future\nversion of Tempest could break.\n\n__ http://docs.openstack.org/tempest/latest/plugin.html\n\n.. _roadmap:\n\nRoadmap\n-------\n\nThe different tests found here all have different hardware requirements, and\nthese requirements often conflict. For example, a test that requires a host\nwithout HyperThreading enabled cannot be used for a test that requires\nHyperThreading. As a result, it's not possible to have one \"master\nconfiguration\" that can be used to run all tests. Instead, different tests must\nbe run on different nodes.\n\nAt present, this plugin exists in isolation and the running of individual tests\non nodes, along with the configuration of said nodes, remains a manual process.\nHowever, the end goal for this project is to be able to kick run this test\nsuite of against *N* overcloud nodes, where each node has a different hardware\nconfiguration and *N* is the total number of different hardware configurations\nrequired (one for real-time, one for SR-IOV, etc.). Each node would have a\ndifferent profile__ and host aggregates would likely be used to ensure each\ntest runs on its preferred hardware. To get here, we should probably provide a\nrecipe along with hardware configuration steps.\n\nThis being said, the above is way off yet. For now, we're focussed on getting\nthe tests in place so we can stop doing all this stuff by hand.\n\n__ http://tripleo.org/install/advanced_deployment/profile_matching.html\n\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/redhat-openstack/whitebox-tempest-plugin", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "whitebox-tempest-plugin", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/whitebox-tempest-plugin/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/whitebox-tempest-plugin/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/redhat-openstack/whitebox-tempest-plugin"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/whitebox-tempest-plugin/0/", "requires_dist": ["oslo.log", "tempest"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Tempest plugin for whitebox testing of TripleO/Director-based OpenStack deployments", "version": "0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            Whitebox Tempest plugin<br>=======================<br><br>This repo is a Tempest plugin that contains scenario tests ran against<br>TripleO/Director-based deployments.<br><br>.. important::<br><br>   This is still a work in progress.<br><br>* Free software: Apache license<br>* Documentation: n/a<br>* Source: https://review.rdoproject.org/r/gitweb?p=openstack/whitebox-tempest-plugin.git<br>* Bugs: n/a<br><br>Requirements<br>------------<br><br>The tests assume a TripleO/Director-based deployment with an undercloud and<br>overcloud.

If you have already installed Microsoft Visual Studio, you cannot install the Visual C++ Build Tools. It will ask you to uninstall your existing VS when you tried to install the Visual C++ build tools using the standalone installer. However, since you already have the VS, you can go to Control Panel\u2014Programs and Features and right click the VS item and Change-Modify, then check the option of those components that relates to the Visual C++ Build Tools, like Visual C++, Windows SDD, then install them. Please also make sure the Build tools path has been added to the system path.\n\nOnce you have the Visual C++ Build Tools, you can build the package as follows:\n\n```python\npython setup.py build_ext --inplace --compiler=msvc\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n### Linux\n\nInstall from the source code:\n\n```python\npython setup.py install\n```", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/umlkhuang/glovepy", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/umlkhuang/glovepy", "keywords": "NLP,Machine Learning", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "glovepy", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/glovepy/", "platform": "linux", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/glovepy/", "project_urls": {"Download": "https://github.com/umlkhuang/glovepy", "Homepage": "https://github.com/umlkhuang/glovepy"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/glovepy/0.0.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Python implementation of the GloVe algorithm for word embedding", "version": "0.0.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p># GlovePy</p>\n<p>A Python implementation with Cython of the [GloVe](<a href=\"http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/</a>) algorithm with multi-threaded training.\nthis Python package mainly contains two Python classes.

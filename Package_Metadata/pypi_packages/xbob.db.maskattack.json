This means that the\n   database raw files must be installed somewhere in this case. With option\n   ``1`` you can run in `dummy` mode and only download the raw data files for\n   the database once you are happy with your setup.\n\nYou can mix and match points 1/2 and a/b above based on your requirements. Here\nare some examples:\n\nModify your setup.py and download from PyPI\n===========================================\n\nThat is the easiest. Edit your ``setup.py`` in your satellite package and add\nthe following entry in the ``install_requires`` section (note: ``...`` means\n`whatever extra stuff you may have in-between`, don't put that on your\nscript)::\n\n    install_requires=[\n      ...\n      \"xbob.db.maskattack\",\n    ],\n\nProceed normally with your ``boostrap/buildout`` steps and you should be all\nset. That means you can now import the ``xbob.db.maskattack`` namespace into your scripts.\n\nModify your buildout.cfg and download from git\n==============================================\n\nYou will need to add a dependence to `mr.developer\n<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.developer/>`_ to be able to install from our\ngit repositories.

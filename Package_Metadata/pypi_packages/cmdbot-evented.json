It consists of a core module that\ndefines a `Bot` class you can extend to fit your needs. It comes with a\n`Brain`, that is to say a simple instance of ``object`` that can contain\nany data you want. That's like a *memory* that lives as long as the Bot is\nworking.\n\nIt's far from being 100% perfect, but I think it takes the best of Python's\nintrospection mechanism.\n\nBy the way, why the name \"CmdBot\"? Because its function loading system has been\ninspired by the `Python's cmd module <http://docs.python.org/library/cmd.html>`_,\nthat uses class member introspection to catch the designated functions and\nexecute them.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nThis piece of software is published under the terms of the WTFPL  (Do What\nThe Fuck You Want License), that can be summed as its term \"0\":\n\n     0.

You can use the sample bot.ini file\nthat sits in the source code, or edit your own. You just have to know that only\ntwo variables **must** be set in it::\n\n    [general]\n    host = name.your.server\n    chan = #nameyourchan\n\nThe other vars are optional, and usually default values would suit.\n\nThe \"admin\" value\n#################\n\nIf you want some admin to take this bot over (and you surely need it at some point),\nset the value with a space-separated list of nicks... e.g.::\n\n    admins = nick1 nick2 nick3\n\nYou may use the \"@admin\" decorator in your extended classes to process the bot\nline **only** if the user that has send the order is in this nick list.\n\n\nWant to run the bot?\n--------------------\n\nIt's as simple as::\n\n    python cmdbot/core.py bot.ini\n\nBut... your bot won't be able to do much.

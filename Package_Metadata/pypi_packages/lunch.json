This software was created to suit the needs\nof new media artists for live performances and interactive installations.\nIt respawns the software that crash and provides a mean to manage\ndependencies between running processes.\n\nIt provides the command-line lunch utility which can be invoked with a GTK+\nuser interface.\n\nSee http://code.sat.qc.ca/redmine/projects/lunch for more information.\n\n\nUSING LUNCH\n===========\n\nHere is a quick how-to. Make sure lunch is installed first. (see INSTALL)\nThere should be a Lunch icon in the Application/Other Gnome menu.\n\nCopy the \"config-sample\" example config file to the local ~/.lunchrc ::\n\n cp doc/examples/config-sample ~/.lunchrc\n\nEdit the configuration file to suit your needs::\n\n edit ~/.lunchrc\n\nStart the lunch master::\n\n lunch\n\nA remote lunch-slave is started this way::\n\n lunch-slave -i \"xlogo\"\n lunch-slave \"xdg-open\"\n\nNext, the lunch scripts controls the lunch-slave via its standard input and output. Type \"help\" in lunch-slave and press enter to see how the lunch-slave prompt is used by lunch. That prompt is not meant to be used directly by an operator, but rather only through lunch.\n\nThe .lunch/config file is written in the Python language and the only function needed to be called there is add_command. Here are some examples::\n\n add_command(command=\"xlogo\", env={}, identifier=\"xlogo\")\n add_command(command=\"mplayer /usr/share/example-content/Ubuntu_Free_Culture_Showcase/StopMotionUbuntu.ogv\", env={}, identifier=\"mplayer\")\n\nSetting the user and host arguments make it be issued through SSH to a remote host::\n \n add_command(command=\"xlogo\", env={\"DISPLAY\":\":0.0\"}, user=_user, host=\"example.org\", identifier=\"remote_xlogo\")\n\nSee the examples for more information about this.\n\n\nVersioning\n==========\n\nThis project uses the common \"Linux kernel\" versioning system, where even-numbered minor versions are stable and odd-numbered minor versions are development snapshots.\n\nThe micro version indicates the origin of the release: even micro numbers are only used for released archives; odd micro numbers are only used on the Git repository.\n\nA stable series means that the command-line options and the interactive keyboard controls should not change much for all tags whose version number start with the same major-minor numbers. Some new features might be developped in that branch, but each release should be backward-compatible with their ancestor. Releases from a stable series should be use for production. \n\nIn contrast, unstable branches consist of tags which are developer snapshots. They are not expected to be compatible with any other version. Some features might change between different stable branches.\n\n\nHow to use Git with the http://code.sat.qc.ca/ server\n======================================================\n\nClone the repository:\n\n  $ git clone git://code.sat.qc.ca/lunch.git\n\n\n\nLogging and PID directories\n===========================\n\nLunch stores log files and pid files respectively in /tmp/log/lunch/$USER and /tmp/run/lunch/$USER. $USER is replaced by the UNIX user name of the user. When you install lunch, it creates those directories. If you want to use lunch without installing it, you must provide the --logging-directory and --pid-directory options. Those log files are for the lunch-slave executables only. (not the lunch master) The PID file is for the lunch master to store its PID so that you can kill it with lunch --kill.\n\n\nLICENSE\n=======\n\nLunch is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n\nAUTHORS\n=======\n\nAlexandre Quessy (http://alexandre.quessy.net)\nMichal Seta <djiamnot@gmail.com>\n\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://code.sat.qc.ca/redmine/projects/lunch", "keywords": null, "license": "UNKNOWN", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "lunch", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/lunch/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/lunch/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://code.sat.qc.ca/redmine/projects/lunch"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/lunch/0.6.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "The Lunch Distributed Process Launcher", "version": "0.6.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"the-lunch-distributed-process-launcher\">\n<h2>The Lunch distributed process launcher</h2>\n<p>Lunch is a distributed process launcher and manager for GNU/Linux.</p>\n<p>With Lunch, one can launch software processes on several different computers\nand make sure they keep running.

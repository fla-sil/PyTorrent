It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.\nYou are using pip version 18.1, however version 19.0.2 is available.\nYou should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.\n  </pre>\n</details>\n\nIn the log file, there is a line 76 which contains the information about the package which broke the installation: `certifi`. We want to extract this information. In the most common case, we want to get a **report** containing the observations about this particular build log.\n\n```python\nfrom thoth.build_analysers.analysis import build_breaker_report\n\nlog: str = ...\nreport: dict = build_breaker_report(log)\n```\n\nThe result is a dictionary which can further be formatted by the convenient `build_breaker_format_report` function.\n\n```python\nfrom thoth.build_analysers.analysis import build_breaker_format_report\n\nprint(build_breaker_format_report(report))\n```\n\nAnd you should see something like this:\n```\nBuild breaker:\n\n    {\n        \"already_satisfied\": null,\n        \"source\": \"thoth-lab\",\n        \"target\": \"certifi\",\n        \"version_installed\": null,\n        \"version_specified\": \">=2017.4.17\"\n    }\n\nProbable reason:\n\n    76: Cannot uninstall 'certifi'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.\n\nCandidates:\n\n    [\n        \"76: Cannot uninstall 'certifi'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.\"\n    ]\n\n```\n\n<br>\n\n### How it works\n\nThe logic is quite simple (and also a bit naive). Really, no rocket science, just a lot of string matching.\n\n##### The intuition\n\nThe approach currently handles logs produced by pip and pipenv package installers. For both of them, there is a set of patterns which, if found in a log, potentially indicate an error. These patterns are strings formatted according to the [PEP3101](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/) string formatting syntax and are stored in the [`resources`](/thoth/build_analysers/resources) folder as [pandas DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html).\n\nWe evaluate the 'goodness' of a match for each line of the log file with respect to the relevant set of patterns and label them based on the given *thresholds*. Currently, the `ERROR` threshold is set to the score of *>=0.6* on the scale from *0* through *1.0*. Finally, we try to search for package names in the log file to construct a dependency table. We filter the `ERROR`s containing a package name and we've got ourselves a list of *build breakers*.\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n\nThe package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/thoth-build-analysers/):\n\n```bash\npip install thoth-build-analysers\n```\n\nAnd you're good to go :thumbsup:\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n> Author: Marek Cermak

Really, no rocket science, just a lot of string matching.</p>\n<h5>The intuition</h5>\n<p>The approach currently handles logs produced by pip and pipenv package installers. For both of them, there is a set of patterns which, if found in a log, potentially indicate an error. These patterns are strings formatted according to the <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PEP3101</a> string formatting syntax and are stored in the <a href=\"/thoth/build_analysers/resources\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>resources</code></a> folder as <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">pandas DataFrames</a>.</p>\n<p>We evaluate the 'goodness' of a match for each line of the log file with respect to the relevant set of patterns and label them based on the given <em>thresholds</em>. Currently, the <code>ERROR</code> threshold is set to the score of <em>&gt;=0.6</em> on the scale from <em>0</em> through <em>1.0</em>. Finally, we try to search for package names in the log file to construct a dependency table. We filter the <code>ERROR</code>s containing a package name and we've got ourselves a list of <em>build breakers</em>.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>The package is available on <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/thoth-build-analysers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PyPI</a>:</p>\n<pre>pip install thoth-build-analysers\n</pre>\n<p>And you're good to go :thumbsup:</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Author: Marek Cermak <a href=\"mailto:macermak@redhat.com\">macermak@redhat.com</a>, @AICoE - Project Thoth</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n          </div>"}, "last_serial": 5322548, "releases": {"0.1.0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "eb8783f59060fd92d1c4e64bbf705cd9", "sha256": "7c9766828c6132e6dad8ae56db1db0af668ab07aa7370b6ea5ff0a65f64303c3"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "thoth_build_analysers-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "eb8783f59060fd92d1c4e64bbf705cd9", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": null, "size": 42963, "upload_time": "2019-05-27T14:21:24", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-05-27T14:21:24.159617Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d9/5e/67fd6b6a1a0392083b306764c0f18c65e415c26d75c61173628f01409115/thoth_build_analysers-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl", "yanked": false}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "268b1a381eebe904e71564b119b35140", "sha256": "375faf23f0faca723710b78abaacbb8bc62e2b903792ded1a362d6d7ad3b4303"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "thoth-build-analysers-0.1.0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "268b1a381eebe904e71564b119b35140", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 744974, "upload_time": "2019-05-27T14:21:26", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-05-27T14:21:26.503670Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/73/45/d36b403f07a89f20c9441cfbf67e178330f4c6291e46792b0efcc5058658/thoth-build-analysers-0.1.0.tar.gz", "yanked": false}], "0.1.0rc0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "a09afe39df6a36b13be7d24a3585fc77", "sha256": "d9c6c4baeb9c29ced6180601e161837d44d6ccb3f590a9603d7947f9457328b1"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "thoth_build_analysers-0.1.0rc0-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "a09afe39df6a36b13be7d24a3585fc77", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": null, "size": 43000, "upload_time": "2019-05-27T13:57:10", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-05-27T13:57:10.550788Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/7d/4c/1278619f79ea0b5809ca07a02e35fd1d3d07d9c54c7ede465810208bf1c9/thoth_build_analysers-0.1.0rc0-py3-none-any.whl", "yanked": false}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "e5d1cc142b4c368bf3111e39ff68f8a4", "sha256": "f5227263751dbdc4ec96caf9f2b40b99737ae564ff8c39bcde48d9c34b77ab39"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "thoth-build-analysers-0.1.0rc0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "e5d1cc142b4c368bf3111e39ff68f8a4", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 744985, "upload_time": "2019-05-27T13:57:13", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-05-27T13:57:13.976877Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ef/d5/43661bd81eeac6ae3710eecf979934e353bfa6766d20d941a276d7bf402d/thoth-build-analysers-0.1.0rc0.tar.gz", "yanked": false}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "eb8783f59060fd92d1c4e64bbf705cd9", "sha256": "7c9766828c6132e6dad8ae56db1db0af668ab07aa7370b6ea5ff0a65f64303c3"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "thoth_build_analysers-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "eb8783f59060fd92d1c4e64bbf705cd9", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": null, "size": 42963, "upload_time": "2019-05-27T14:21:24", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-05-27T14:21:24.159617Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d9/5e/67fd6b6a1a0392083b306764c0f18c65e415c26d75c61173628f01409115/thoth_build_analysers-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl", "yanked": false}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "268b1a381eebe904e71564b119b35140", "sha256": "375faf23f0faca723710b78abaacbb8bc62e2b903792ded1a362d6d7ad3b4303"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "thoth-build-analysers-0.1.0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "268b1a381eebe904e71564b119b35140", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 744974, "upload_time": "2019-05-27T14:21:26", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-05-27T14:21:26.503670Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/73/45/d36b403f07a89f20c9441cfbf67e178330f4c6291e46792b0efcc5058658/thoth-build-analysers-0.1.0.tar.gz", "yanked": false}], "timestamp": "Fri May  8 02:53:50 2020"}

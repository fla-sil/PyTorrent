It requires you to be a moderator of the subreddit you are copying\nposts to, and allows you to choose, along with the source/destination subreddit:\n\n* The sort method of the posts chosen (hot, new, controversial, and top)\n* The time frame to grab posts from (day, week, month, year, all)\n* How many posts to grab\n* Whether or not to include the comments from the post you mirrored (this\n  functionality is very time consuming)\n\n### Why?\n\nWhenever I create reddit bots, I would normally manually create posts that mimic\nthe posts I would expect when using my bot. This becomes tedious, especially as\nthe bot grows more dynamic over time. Instead, I figured I could write a script\nwhich would do this tedious work for me, and as an added bonus, the content\nwould be real data from the subreddits I would be targeting. \n\n#### Can't you use this for spam?\n\nI suppose so, but you shouldn't. This script includes a simple check to make\nsure that you're a moderator of the subreddit your mirroring posts to. Although\nthis is easy enough to remove, I figured that anyone who'd want to make a spam\nbot could and probably would have without much effort.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ pip install subreddit-mirror\n```\n\nAlternatively, manually download and install the release file from the Github release page.\n\n## Usage\n```\nusage: subreddit-mirror [-h] [--count COUNT]\n                        [--sort {hot,new,controversial,top}]\n                        [--time {day,week,month,year,all}] [--comments] [-v]\n                        subreddit destination\n\nMirror posts from another subreddit.\n\npositional arguments:\n  subreddit             subreddit to copy posts from\n  destination           destination subreddit to post to\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --count COUNT         how many posts to try to copy\n  --sort {hot,new,controversial,top}\n                        how to sort posts\n  --time {day,week,month,year,all}\n                        time frame to grab from\n  --comments            [CAUTION] also mirror comments from threads, may take\n                        a long time\n  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit\n```\n\n### Optional Parameter Defaults\n\n| Option       | Default Parameter |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| `--count`    | `15`              |\n| `--sort`     | `'new'`           |\n| `--time`     | `'day'`           |\n| `--comments` | `False`           |\n\n\n### Examples\n\n* `$ subreddit-mirror hiphopheads trapmuzik`\n\n    Copies the newest 15 newest poststoday from /r/hiphopheads to /r/trapmuzik\n* `$ subreddit-mirror calamariraceteam motorcycles --count 10 --sort top --time all`:\n\n    Copies the top 10 posts of all time from /r/calamariraceteam to /r/motorcycles\n\n## Dependencies\n* [PRAW](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw)\n* [progress](https://github.com/verigak/progress) \n\n## License\n```\nsubreddit-mirror -- A script to copy posts from one subreddit to another.\nCopyright (C) 2018  Jacob Patterson\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

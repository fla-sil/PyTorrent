It also requires \nroot permission for the \"-start\", \"-stop\" and \"-status\" argument since it needs to alter the CronTab files.\n\n[futurize](http://python-future.org/overview.html) library is used for the purpose of making the code compatible with both, python 2 and python 3.  \n\n## Installation And Usage\n\nCurrent build works on Python 2 (Python 3 is supported but a [bug](https://github.com/thealphadollar/GDrive_Sync/issues/11) is there which does not allow connection to be established on systems using proxy).\n\n### Dependencies\nPlease install pip before moving on if you don't have python-pip<br/>\n`sudo apt-get update`<br/>\n`sudo apt-get install python-pip`<br/>\n\nOnce pip is installed, download the below dependencies (you don't need to follow the below steps if using pip installation method).\n1. PyDrive<br/>\n`pip2 install PyDrive`\n2. crontab<br/>\n`pip2 install python-crontab`\n3. future<br/>\n`pip2 install future`\n\n### Installing\nThe repository can be installed through pip or by manually cloning the repository. \n\n##### Using pip\n\n1. Use the below command to install drive_sync using pip2 (till [python3 bug](https://github.com/thealphadollar/GDrive_Sync/issues/11) is resolved)<br/>\n`pip2 install drive_sync`<br/>\nThis process also installs all the missing dependencies.\n2. Open the crontab editor in terminal,<br/>\n`crontab -e`<br/>\nand add the [following lines](https://superuser.com/questions/784252/crontab-and-binaries-in-usr-local-bin) to it.<br/>\n`PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin`<br/>\n`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib`\n3. To initiate the upload process from default directory.<br/>\n`drive_sync -start` <br/>\nThis will open a web browser if its the first launch of GDrive_Sync. Later it'll be used to start the process with previously\nassociated GAccount unless \"-reset\" is used.\n4. Now GDrive_Sync will be monitoring set upload/download folders. Use `-config` parameter to add/modify upload or download\ndirectory.\n5. To stop GDrive_Sync at any instance,<br/>\n`drive_sync -stop`\n6. To know if GDrive_Sync is active,<br/>\n`./gdrive_sync/main.py -status` \n\n##### Manual Cloning\n\n1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/thealphadollar/GDrive_Sync.git), <br/>\n`git clone https://github.com/thealphadollar/GDrive_Sync.git`\n2. Open the folder and give<br/>\n`./gdrive_sync/main.py -start`<br/>\nThis command adds `./gdrive_sync/main.py -start` to your cron jobs with periodicity of 5 minutes.\n3. A link will open asking for GDrive access; allow for all.\n4. Now GDrive_Sync will be monitoring set upload/download folders. Use `-config` parameter to add/modify upload or download\ndirectory.\n5. To stop GDrive_Sync at any instance,<br/>\n`./gdrive_sync/main.py -stop`\n6. To know if GDrive_Sync is active,<br/>\n`./gdrive_sync/main.py -status` \n\n### What Cron Script Does?\n\nThe code for this is present in `gdrive_sync/cron_handle.py`\n\n- Periodically checks (every 5 minutes) the upload folders for a file change.\n- If a new file is found which is not being uploaded by any other instance of the same function, it marks it as being uploaded\nand starts the upload process.\n- status.json in every folder is used to monitor the \"being_uploaded\" status of each file in the folder.\n- If Remove_Post_Upload is True in `config_dicts/config.json`, then the file is deleted post upload to GDrive. Otherwise, \nit is moved to the set download directory.\n- If Share_Link is True in `config_dicts/config.json` then a share link for each uploaded file is placed in the set download\ndirectory. \n- It is highly advisable to set your own download and upload directories.\n\n### Why Require GDrive Authentication?\n\nGDrive_Sync requires Google Drive full read and write access. \n\nIt asks for \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\" which translates to,<br/>\n\"Full, permissive scope to access all of a user's files, excluding the Application Data folder. Request this scope only when it is strictly necessary.\"<br/>\n\nThis is required in order to download and upload files as well as create directories along with creation of sharable link.\n\nThe author cannot modify/manipulate any personal data or Google Drive files. All the write/read access are provided solely to\nthe user granting the permission.  \n \n## Parameters\n\nThe parameters that can be used are:\n\n* -reset\n\nReset account associated with GDrive_Sync and give it the read and write permissions to your Google Drive. Automatically executed at the\nfirst run of GDrive_Sync.\n\n* -start\n\nStart the automatic GDrive syncing of the folders set as upload directories.\n\n* -stop\n\nStop the automatic GDrive syncing of the folders set as upload directories.\n\n* -status\n\nShows whether GDrive is uploading automatically or not.\n\n* -version\n\nShows the current version of the GDrive_Sync.\n\n* -config\n\nGives option to edit the configuration file on which automatic upload and download works.\n- Up_Directory: The directory where the files that are to be uploaded are given, relative to home directory.\n    (e.g. for \"~/Documents/to_GDrive\", input \"Documents/to_GDrive\")\n    (Default is \"to_GDrive\" directory in your Documents folder)\n- Down_Directory: The directory where the files are downloaded, relative to home directory.\n    (e.g. for \"~/Documents/from_GDrive\", input \"Documents/from_GDrive\")\n    (Default is \"from_GDrive\" directory in you Documents folder)\n- Remove_Post_Upload: [Y/N] 'Y' removes the local file post upload. 'N' moves the file to GDrive download folder\npost upload.\n    (Default is 'N')\n- Share_Link: [Y/N] 'Y' puts the shareable link of the file uploaded in share.txt in Up_Directory.\n    (Default is 'Y')\n- Write_Permission: [Y/N] 'Y' gives the write permission in the sharable link.\n    (Default is 'N')\n\nConfiguration is stored in config.json as a dictionary which can be manually edited as well.\n\n* -ls [local/remote]\n\nLists all files and folders in your GDrive (default or when \"remote\" used).\nLists all files and folders in your downloads directory (when \"local\" used).\n\n* -ls_trash\n\nLists all files and folders in your GDrive trash.\n\n* -ls_folder [folder_id]\n\nLists files and folders in the given folder id in your drive.\n\n* -ls_files [folder_id/\"root\"]\n\nLists all files recursively present in the folder id given.\n\n* -download [file_id1] [file_id2]\n\nDownloads the given file from GDrive. Multiple files can be downloaded by putting file_ids one after the other.\nUse \"-d all\" argument to download entire your entire GDrive.\n\n* -upload [file_add]\n\nUpload file/folder corresponding to the address given to GDrive, for one time.\n\n* -share [file_id]\n\nOutputs the shareable link of the file.\n\n* -remove [local/remote] [file_name/folder_name/file_id/folder_id]\n\nDelete the mentioned file from GDrive download directory or GDrive remote. Please input file_id/folder_id if it's a\nremote file. You can add multiple file_ids/folder_ids one after the other, e.g. -remove remote [file_id1] [file_id2]\n\n* -open [upload/download]\n\nOpens the upload or download directory in file explorer.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to this project are highly encouraged. We will soon be having a contribution guide.<br/>\nTo begin, please have a look at the issues. They are simple and easy to implement/resolve.", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/thealphadollar/GDrive_Sync", "keywords": "google-drive GDrive automatic sync GDrive manager", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "drive-sync", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/drive-sync/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/drive-sync/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://github.com/thealphadollar/GDrive_Sync"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/drive-sync/1.222/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "GDrive_Sync is an automatic folder syncing client for Google Drive", "version": "1.222", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            # GDrive_Sync<br><br>This repository contains scripts that make GDrive tasks easier using command line functions and PyDrive wrapper for Google Drive.<br><br>GDrive_Sync aims at making life simpler when switching from Windows to Linux<br><br>This was developed with the aim to create a free and open source GDrive client to make things simpler and users won't<br>need to switch to other cloud file storing platforms or have to pay for commercial clients doing the same.<br><br>## Operational Details<br><br>GDrive_Sync asks for permission from your Google Drive account to carry out the essential operations as are mentioned later<br>in the document.<br><br>GDrive_Sync uses [PyDrive](https://github.com/googledrive/PyDrive) and [crontab](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-crontab) to interact with GDrive and Unix cron process manager respectively.

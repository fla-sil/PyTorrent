Generalizing, see if structures with an outlier of a measure (or set of measures) is correlated with other measures characteristics, such as the correlation histogram.\n\nAre there benchmark datasets and results for the statistics used in percolation? If so, integrate them into legacy.statistics.tests.\nOtherwise, make benchmarks from synthesized and empirical data.\n\nPercolation makes use of other packages designed for percolation for direct use or through the rendered RDF they deliver.\nThese are:\n- The social package for rendering RDF data from social networking platforms and protocols (e.g. facebook, twitter, irc, instagram, noosfero, diaspora)\n- The gmane package for rendering RDF data from public Gmane email lists (e.g. apache, c++ stdlib)\n- The participation package for rendering RDF data from social participation platforms (e.g. participabr, cidade democratica, aa)\n- The scientific package (ToDo) for rendering RDF data from scientific resources such as FAPESP\n- The music package to render music from open linked social data\n- The visuals package to render images and movies from open linked social data\n\nSee legacy.triples for further notes.\n\nSee percolationLegacy issues at: https://github.com/ttm/percolationLegacy/issues\n\nSee this deprecated document for some of the intended goals:\nhttps://github.com/ttm/percolationlegacy/blob/master/latex/percolation-article.pdf", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/ttm/percolation", "keywords": "complexity networks human interaction physics data text mining analysis visualization music physics synthesis toolbox semantic web linked data owl ontology social participation anthropological physics", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "percolation", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/percolation/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/percolation/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/ttm/percolation"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/percolation/0.2.dev0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "percolation is a python package for harnessing open linked social data", "version": "0.2.dev0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            # percolation<br>the percolation python package for harnessing open linked social data<br><br>## install with:<br>If you are running Ubuntu, you may want to install pygraphviz from standard (apt) package manager.<br><br>    $ pip install percolation<br>or<br>    $ python setup.py install<br>For greater control of customization (and debugging), clone the repo and install with pip with -e:<br>    $ git clone https://github.com/ttm/percolation.git<br>    $ pip install -e &lt;path_to_repo&gt;<br>This install method is especially useful when reloading modified module in subsequent runs of percolation<br>(usually with the standard importlib).<br><br>Percolation may use social, music and visuals packages to enable anthropological physics experiments and social harnessing:<br>- https://github.com/ttm/social<br>- https://github.com/ttm/music<br>- https://github.com/ttm/visuals<br><br><br>## core features<br>  - Provide routines for percolation in social systems by experiments and processes.<br>  - Ease knowledge about the networked self.<br>  - Analyses of social systems through textual, topological, temporal statistics within a typology framework of agents and networks.<br>  - Art and games from social structures, such as music and animation.<br>  - Integration of resources through RDF data and OWL ontologies.<br>  - Cross provenance resource recommendation, extending facilities from the Participation package.<br>  - WWW integration to provide data and media.<br><br>## coding conventions<br>A function name has a verb if it changes state of initialized objects, if it only \"returns something\", it is has no verb in name.<br>This rule is extended for the cases where instead of return triples, they are added to the percolation\\_graph.<br><br>Classes, functions and variables are writen in CamelCase, headlessCamelCase and lowercase, respectively.<br>Underline is used only in variable names where the words in variable name make something unreadable (usually because the resulting name is big).<br><br>The code is the documentation.

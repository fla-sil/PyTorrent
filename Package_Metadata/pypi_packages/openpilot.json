We'd like to support [Open Source Car Control](https://github.com/PolySync/OSCC) as well.\n\nTo install it on the NEO:\n\n```bash\n# Requires working adb in PATH\ncd installation\n./install.sh\n```\n\nSupported Cars\n------\n\n- Acura ILX 2016 with AcuraWatch Plus\n  - Limitations: Due to use of the cruise control for gas, it can only be enabled above 25 mph\n\n- Honda Civic 2016 Touring Edition\n  - Limitations: Due to limitations in steering firmware, steering is disabled below 18 mph\n\nDirectory structure\n------\n\n- board         -- Code that runs on the USB interface board\n- cereal        -- The messaging spec used for all logs on the phone\n- common        -- Library like functionality we've developed here\n- dbcs          -- Files showing how to interpret data from cars\n- installation  -- Installation on the neo platform\n- phonelibs     -- Libraries used on the phone\n- selfdrive     -- Code needed to drive the car\n  - assets        -- Fonts for ui\n  - boardd        -- Daemon to talk to the board\n  - calibrationd  -- Camera calibration server\n  - common        -- Shared C/C++ code for the daemons\n  - controls      -- Python controls (PID loops etc) for the car\n  - logcatd       -- Android logcat as a service\n  - loggerd       -- Logger and uploader of car data\n  - sensord       -- IMU / GPS interface code\n  - ui            -- The UI\n  - visiond       -- embedded vision pipeline\n\nTo understand how the services interact, see `common/services.py`\n\nDeveloping\n------\n\nopenpilot does not (yet) work as an installable python package and relies on it's root folder being the python home.\n\n```\n   pip install -e .\n   python -m openpilot.selfdrive.manager\n```\n\nAdding Car Support\n------\n\nIt should be relatively easy to add support for the Honda CR-V Touring. The brake message is the same. Steering has a slightly different message with a different message id. Sniff CAN while using LKAS to find it.\n\nThe Honda Accord uses different signalling for the steering and probably requires new hardware.\n\nAdding other manufacturers besides Honda/Acura is doable but will be more of an undertaking.\n\n\nUser Data / chffr Account / Crash Reporting\n------\n\nBy default openpilot creates an account and includes a client for chffr, our dashcam app. We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.\n\nIt's open source software, so you are free to disable it if you wish. \n\nIt logs the road facing camera, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.\nIt does not log the user facing camera or the microphone.\n\nBy using it, you agree to [our privacy policy](https://beta.comma.ai/privacy.html).

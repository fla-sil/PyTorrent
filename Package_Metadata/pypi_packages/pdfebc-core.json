This package contains the core\nfunctions that may be utilized by different user interfaces. Currently, I am planning to create\na CLI, a web interface and a desktop GUI. This is very much a practice project for me, but one\nthat is alos useful to me (at least the CLI version, the others are just practice).\n\nAs an example use case, I mainly use ``pdfebc`` as an easy way to compress lecture slides and \nsimilar study materials, send them to my Kindle and then clean up the output.\n\nPurpose of the project\n======================\nThe core functionality of ``pdfebc``, along with a basic CLI, was already done when I started \nthis little project. As such, the main purpose here isn't to provide the functionality,\nbut to do so in a robust way, with proper documentation, testing and continuous integration. \nThis is also an exercise in writing a program's business logic in such a way so that any\ninterface can be slapped on top of it. This is also one of my first forays into using stuff like \n``sphinx``, ``Travis-CI`` and ``ReadTheDocs``, so there's bound to be some weirdness here and\nthere. I am also diving deeper into how to use ``git`` and trying new things, so the commit \nhistory may suffer from some inconsistencies.\n\nRequirements\n============\nAside from the Python omdules listed in `requirements.txt`_, the following requirements must be\nmet:\n\n* Python 3.6\n    - Strictly speaking, 3.5 should also work fine, but the tests use 3.6 features so the\n      build is only tested for 3.6.\n* ``Ghostscript``\n    - ``pdfebc`` requires ``Ghostscript`` for the PDF compression. The default binary is ``gs``,\n      but this can be specified via the CLI.\n* A Gmail account (for sending e-mails)\n    - By default, ``pdfebc`` uses Google's SMTP server to send e-mails. The program can however\n      be configured to use any SMTP server by maniupulating the ``config.cnf`` file (please see\n      this `sample configuration`_ for formatting). Currently, the server must support TLS.\n\nInstall\n=======\nOption 1: Install from PyPi with ``pip``\n----------------------------------------\nThe latest release of ``pdfebc-core`` is on PyPi, and can thus be installed as usual with ``pip``.\nI strongly discourage system-wide ``pip`` installs (i.e. ``sudo pip install <package>``), as this\nmay land you with incompatible packages in a very short amount of time. A per-user install\ncan be done like this:\n\n1. Execute ``pip install --user pdfebc-core`` to install the package.\n2. Currently, you must add the configuration file manually. Please have a look at the\n   `sample configuration`_ file for details. Where to put the configuration file is\n   machine-dependent, and decided by the ``appdirs`` package. Run \n   ``apdirs.user_config_dir('pdfebc')`` in the Python interpreter to find the correct directory.\n   Note that you must first import ``appdirs`` for it to be available in the interpreter.\n   **Note:** When using a Gmail account, I strongly recommend\n   using an `App password`_ instead of the actual account password.\n\nOption 2: Clone the repo and the install with ``pip``\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIf you want the dev version, you will need to clone the repo, as only release versions are uploaded\nto PyPi. Unless you are planning to work on this yourself, I suggest going with the release version.\n\n1. Clone the repo with ``git``:\n    - ``git clone https://github.com/slarse/pdfebc-core``\n2. ``cd`` into the project root directory and install with ``pip``.\n    - ``pip install --user .``, this will create a local install for the current user.\n    - Or just ``pip install .`` if you use ``virtualenv``.\n    - For development, use ``pip install -e .`` in a ``virtualenv``.\n3. Currently, you must add the configuration file manually. Please have a look at the\n   `sample configuration`_ file for details. Where to put the configuration file is\n   machine-dependent, and decided by the ``appdirs`` package. Run \n   ``apdirs.user_config_dir('pdfebc')`` in the Python interpreter to find the correct directory.\n   Note that you must first import ``appdirs`` for it to be available in the interpreter.\n   **Note:** When using a Gmail account, I strongly recommend\n   using an `App password`_ instead of the actual account password.\n\nLicense\n=======\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.

Included in the documentation is a Usage\nfile (docs/usage.html) which provides a simple and hopefully helpful explanation about how the methods work and how to call them.\n\n\n\nFileWork is a class for simplifying work with files.  \n\nMost of the tedious code for working with a file is contained in the class, so the calling code doesn't need to bother with it.\n\nA FileWork object can:\n\n1. Create a file\n2. Write to a File\n3. Append content to a File\n4. Read the entire contents of a File\n5. Read a file one line at a time\n6. Open or Close the Connection to a File\n7. Delete a File\n\nThis module was originally created for the waxtablet application.  \n\n\n\nAfter installation of this package is complete, trying to use the module might result in the following error: \"ImportError: No module named filework\"\nor some other error message.\n\nThis probably indicates that the Python interpreter may not be able to locate the module.  In this case,\nthe following is recommended:\n\n\tOn Linux:\n\n\t\tLocate where the package was installed.  In the terminal, navigate to the root directory and execute the following command:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsudo find . -name filework.py\n\n\n\t\tThis should give a path to the filework.py file.  \n\t\tCreate a file called \"local_python.sh\" and put the following text in it:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPYTHONPATH=\"/usr/local/lib/python*.*/dist-packages/filework/\":\"${PYTHONPATH}\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texport PYTHONPATH\n\n\t\tTo make the module available to all users, place this file in /etc/profile.d.  Then place a line to execute this\n\t\tfile somewhere in .bashrc or one of the other bash configuration files in the individual (non-root) user's terminal: \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    . /etc/profile.d/local_python.sh\n\n\t\tThis should cause the python interpreter to locate the filework.py file in the module.   \n\n\n\tOn MS Windows:\n\n\t\tThe following was tested on a machine running Windows 10. \n\n\t\t(This assumes that Python is installed on the machine.)\n\n\t\tLocate where the package was installed.  On Windows 10, Look for the Python folder.  Its usually right under the C: drive. \n\t\tThe name of the folder probably has the version number in it as well, like \"Python27\".  Look for the filework folder: it should\n\t\tbe in \"Lib\\\" and then \"site-packages\\\" folder.  \n\n\t\tOpen up the System Properties Panel.  (You can find this by clicking on the \"Settings\" icon and entering \"Environment Variables\" in the \n\t\tsearch bar.  When the panel comes up, Click the \"Environment Variables\" button.  Under \"System variables\", click \"New\" and type in the full path to\n\t\tthe filework folder.\n\n\t\tTest this by opening the command line application and starting the Python interpreter (type the command \"python\" and press enter).\n\t\tNow try to import the module and instantiate a filework object.  Type the following:\n\n\t\t>>> import filework\n\t\t>>> sg = filework.SQLiteMgr()\n\t\t>>> sg.result\n\n\t\tIf everything went well, 'None' should print out on the screen.  If there was an \"ImportError\" or any other error, try importing the\n\t\tmodule again and test as follows: \n\n\n\t\t>>> import filework.filework as filework\n\t\t>>> sg = filework.FileWork()\n\t\t>>> sg.result\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/aescwork/filework", "keywords": "filework development files file read write delete append", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "filework", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/filework/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/filework/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/aescwork/filework"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/filework/1.1.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "A simple wrapper class for easy reading from/iterating through, writing, and appending to files.", "version": "1.1.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>This package can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/aescwork/filework\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/aescwork/filework</a>.</p>\n<p>In the github repository there is sphinx-generated documentation: the main page is docs/index.html.

It is of course\nalso heavily influenced by grep and friends.\n\nIt is intended to provide several different things:\n\n1. A tool and with a friendly command line interface for searching for things\n   a la grep, and transforming them a la sed, awk, perl -e and so forth.\n\n2. Libraries in several languages to match the functionality of that tool.\n\n3. A tool for generating parsers in multiple languages for a given grammar.\n\n4. Libraries for the above as well.\n\n5. A study in implementing a non-trivial problem in multiple languages.\n\nWhat works\n----------\n\nAt the moment, GLOP can accept grammars and execute them using a *very* \nsimple language for executing actions on the parsed text.\n\nThe code is only implemented in Python.\n\nThings that still need to be implemented\n----------------------------------------\n\n* parser generators.\n\n* a generated parser that matches the hand-rolled one (glop needs to be \n  able to bootstrap itself up).\n\nOpen issues\n-----------\n\nBasically, everything is still open. \n\nOne of the distinctive aspects of LPEG is its focus on matching patterns,\nrather than entire grammars. Focusing on patterns leads one to a syntax\nmore tuned for patterns, as terminals are more common than non-terminals.\n\n.. _LPEG: http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg\n.. _OMeta: http://github.com/alexwarth/ometa-js/", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": null, "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/dpranke/glop", "keywords": null, "license": "Apache", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "glop", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/glop/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/glop/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/dpranke/glop"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/glop/0.1.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "GLOP - the Generalized Lpeg and Ometa-inspired Parsing and printing framework.", "version": "0.1.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>GLOP - the Generalized Lpeg and Ometa-inspired Parsing and printing framework.</p>\n<div id=\"introduction\">\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>GLOP is an exploration of parsing expression grammars, mostly influenced by\nLua\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg\" rel=\"nofollow\">LPEG</a> module and Alessandro Warth\u2019s <a href=\"http://github.com/alexwarth/ometa-js/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OMeta</a> project.

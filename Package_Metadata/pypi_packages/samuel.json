The C++ engine code,\nboard images and opening book/endgame databases all come from guicheckers.\nSo credit and thanks to the guicheckers people (programming by Jon Kreuzer\ngraphics by Josh Hess) for making their code available. You can find the\nguicheckers website at http://www.3dkingdoms.com/checkers.htm. \n\nSamuel is named after Arthur Samuel, a pioneer of Computer Draughts, see\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel.\n\nLinux Installation\n------------------\n**Prerequisites**\n\nYou need to install these prerequisites first:\n\n    * python3\n    * python3-cairo\n    * python3-gobject\n    * python3-devel\n    * g++\n\nYou need the python3 versions.\nThese will have different names depending on your distro.\n\nOn Debian/Mint/Ubuntu\n    * python3-gi-cairo\n    * python3-dev\n    * build-essential\n\nOn Fedora\n    * python3-cairo\n    * python3-gobject\n    * python3-devel\n    * gcc-c++\n    * redhat-rpm-config\n\n**Installation**\n\nRunning from the Source Directory\n\n  You can run samuel from the source directory without\n  doing the full install (recommended).\n\n  To do this:\n\n  |  *'python3 setup.py build'* to build it.\n\n  |  *'python3 run.py'* to run it from within the source folder.\n\nInstalling on the system     \n\n  |  *'python3 setup.py build'* to build it (as normal user).\n  |  *'python3 setup.py install'* to install it (as root user).\n\n  Note:\n\n  Samuel should now be installed on your system. You can launch it from\n  the gnome menu (under games) or type 'samuel' in any terminal window.\n\n  There is no uninstall (distutils doesn't have one). If you need to     \n  uninstall you have to make a note of the file names and then delete\n  them manually.\n\n  If running the build/install multiple times it's best to delete the\n  build folder each time. \n\n  You can also install from the python package index using\n  'pip3 install samuel'. \n\nUsage\n-----\nBy default the computer plays white, you play red. In English Draughts Red\nmoves first. Click on a red piece and then click on a destination square to\nmove it. The computer will then automatically move a white piece.\n\nIf you want to play as white instead of red then select 'options' then\n'computer plays red' from the menu bar. You will then need to click 'Go'\nor press 'g' to start the game and make the computer make the first move\nfor red.\n\nIf you play as white you can also enable the 'Flip the Board' feature so\nthat the white pieces are at the bottom of the board.\n\nIf the computer plays both white and red you need to click the Go button\neach time to make the computer move. If you are playing Human vs Computer\nthen the computer will make its move automatically after the Human move.\n\nUse the menu bar to set the level of difficulty or save the game etc.\nUse the buttons at the bottom to rewind the game.\n\nIf you want to set the lowest level then select user-defined level and\nset the search depth to zero.\n\nUser settings are stored in the file ~/.samuel/settings\nYou can delete this file to go back to the default settings. \nYou may also want to delete this file if you get problems when switching from\none version of samuel to another since the format can change between versions.\n\nSee also the online help file at\nhttp://www.johncheetham.com/projects/samuel/help/help.html\nThis can be viewed in samuel from the help menu.\n\nSummary of keyboard commands\n----------------------------\n\n   +---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n   | Keys    |    Function                                                    |\n   +=========+================================================================+\n   | CTRL+N  |    New Game                                                    |\n   +---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n   | CTRL+O  |    Load Game                                                   |\n   +---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n   | CTRL+S  |    Save Game                                                   |\n   +---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n   | CTRL+Q  |    Quit Game                                                   |\n   +---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n   | m       |    Move Now - press this to make the computer move immediately |\n   |         |    when it's taking a long time thinking                       |\n   +---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n   | CTRL+C  |    Copy game to clipboard (in PDN format)                      |\n   +---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n   | CTRL+V  |    Paste game from clipbaord (in PDN format)                   |\n   +---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n   | CTRL+0  |    Reset board size to default size                            |\n   +---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+\n   | g       |    Same as the 'Go' button.

For this reason it's best to leave at least 1 second\nbetween clicks.\n\nIf you see a white background around the piece when dragging then you may need\nto install a compositor such as compton.\n\nEnd Game Database\n-----------------\nThe files 2pc.cdb, 3pc.cdb and 4pc.cdb contain moves for the\nend game. These files can be built using the genalldatabases\nprogram.\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\nSamuel uses C++ engine code, board graphics, opening book and endgame database\nfrom guicheckers. \nguicheckers web page: http://www.3dkingdoms.com/checkers.htm\n\nCHANGELOG\n---------\n\nChanges for 0.1.9\n-----------------\n\n2019-02-08  John Cheetham  developer@johncheetham.com\n\n    * port to python3/GTK3\n\n    * allow drag and drop of pieces\n\n    * Make main window resizable\n\n    * bugfixes\n    \nChanges for 0.1.8\n-----------------\n\n2009-10-27  John Cheetham  developer@johncheetham.com \n\n    * Add 'Flip the Board' feature\n\n    * Allow player to choose colour to play (white or red).\n      Also allow player vs computer, player vs player, computer vs computer\n\n    * Add a status bar\n\n    * Enforce time limit on user defined levels but not on pre-set levels.\n      This will improve the play on the pre-set levels.\n\n    * In position edit mode\n         - Allow use of the Delete key to clear the board.\n         - Ignore other key presses except for resize board\n\n    * Add online help file\n\nChanges for 0.1.7\n-----------------\n\n2009-10-02  John Cheetham  developer@johncheetham.com \n\n    * make board resizeable\n\n    * remember users settings between program invocations\n\n    * simplify level settings\n\n    * fix bugs in gameover, movenow and time limit processing\n\n    * add keyboard commands for retract move etc\n\n    * clean up code\n\nChanges for 0.1.6\n-----------------\n\n2009-09-05  John Cheetham  developer@johncheetham.com\n\n    * nice display of multi jumps by the computer\n    \n    * edit board feature\n\n    * suppress compiler warnings (though there are some on centos5 - must be an older compiler)\n\n    * allow user-defined levels\n\nChanges for 0.1.5\n-----------------\n\n2009-08-29  John Cheetham  developer@johncheetham.com\n\n    * Display gameover at end of game\n\n    * Fix keyboard shortcuts in menu\n\n    * Fix fault after loading game from file/PDN/FEN when it's white to play\n      Added a Go button to make white move\n\n    * Don't hilight squares clicked on if end of game or white to move\n\n    * Add explanatory messages to panel when using rewind keys.", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://www.johncheetham.com/projects/samuel/", "keywords": "", "license": "GPLv3+", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "samuel", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/samuel/", "platform": "Linux", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/samuel/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://www.johncheetham.com/projects/samuel/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/samuel/0.1.9/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "A Draughts Program", "version": "0.1.9", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>Samuel - John Cheetham - <a href=\"http://www.johncheetham.com/projects/samuel\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.johncheetham.com/projects/samuel</a></p>\n<div id=\"description\">\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Samuel is a Draughts program written in python3/GTK3/C++.\nIt is licensed under the GPL (see the file named LICENSE).</p>\n<p>It is aimed mainly at Linux users but should work on other systems\ntoo.</p>\n<p>It is derived from guicheckers version 1.05. guicheckers is a draughts\nprogram for windows which comes with source code.

Flowhub is cool with that, too - setting the\noptions one way gives you a translation of ``git-flow``, and setting them\na slightly different way gives you a translation of\n`GitHub Flow <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`_.\n\nYou can also get a hybrid of the two, if that floats your boat.\n\nOutside of a Git repository, Flowhub is super-confused and refuses to work. As\nfar as I know, Flowhub does not integrate with any other Git clients. If it does,\nthat's a happy accident: Flowhub is designed as a command-line tool.\n\nHow do I get Flowhub?\n---------------------------------\n\nGreat question! The easiest way is probably using the overworked and\nunder-appcreciated `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`_, which\nis a very friendly way to install python packages in general.\n\nOnce you have pip on your system, simply run ``pip install flowhub``, and that\nshould be that. If you prefer the bleeding edge of Flowhub development, you can\nget that too: simply clone this repository, checkout the ``develop``\nbranch, and run ``setup.py install`` (be ye warned, however: ``develop`` is not\nguaranteed to be stable). There are very few dependencies -- check out the setup\nscript to see what they are.\n\nAfter installing,\nyou'll have access to the ``flowhub`` command:\n\n::\n\n    flowhub init\n    # blah blah\n    flowhub feature start <name-of-feature>\n\n\nSee ``flowhub -h`` and its descendants for more information.\n\nFlowhub definitely works on OSX and probably works on Linux (last I checked, it\nworks on Ubuntu), and might or might not work on Windows (a new frontier!).\n\nFlowhub now also supports tab-completion in bash and (partially...) in zsh! See\nthe `argcomplete docs <https://argcomplete.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#global-completion>`_\nfor more info about how to enable this sweetness for yourself! zsh users: zsh is totally\ncapable of handling bash completion scripts, but it's gonna take a little more effort to\nmake it work.\n\n\nWhat Can Flowhub Do?\n--------------------\n\nFlowhub keeps groups working in an orderly fashion, with minimal intrusion.\n\nFor Developers\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLet's examine a common use-case: you've forked another repository on GitHub\n(totally coincidentally, this happens to be the case that Flowhub was written\nfor - though it doesn't require this set up).\n\ninit\n++++\n\nSuzy has forked a fellow developer's repository, and already has a clone of it\non her development box. She wants to keep her contributions orderly, and\n(luckily!) the original repository adheres to a single-stable/single-dev branching\nphilosophy already (Flowhub doesn't require this, but it makes things easier).\n\nSuzy decides to use Flowhub (she's got a bright future).\n\n::\n\n    cd /path/to/my/clone\n    flowhub init\n\nAfter answering all of Flowhub's questions, Suzy is ready to start working (she\ndecided to keep all of Flowhub's defaults).\n\nfeature start\n+++++++++++++++\n\nShe's already got some ideas about how to improve the project:\n\n::\n\n    flowhub feature start suzy-feature-the-first\n    Password for 'https://suzyongithub@github.com':\n\n    Summary of actions:\n     - New branch feature/suzy-feature-the-first, from branch develop\n     - Checked out branch feature/suzy-feature-the-first\n\nShe's also come up with a solution to an existing issue:\n\n::\n\n    flowhub feature start -i 13 i-know-the-answer\n    Password for 'https://suzyongithub@github.com':\n\n    Summary of actions:\n     - New branch feature/13-i-know-the-answer, from branch develop\n     - Checked out branch feature/13-i-know-the-answer\n\nWhen she's ready to publish, that branch will be tied to issue #13 on ``canon``.\n\nfeature publish\n+++++++++++++++\n\nAfter Suzy's been working for a while, she decides it's time to get some\nfeedback from the original repository. Flowhub makes this a cakewalk.\n\n::\n\n    flowhub feature publish # Since Suzy is still on her feature branch, Flowhub assumes that's the one to publish\n\nFlowhub creates a pull-request for her, and reports the url so she can quickly\nnavigate to it.\n\nWhen she's gotten some feedback and addressed it, she runs the same command.\nFlowhub updates the pull-request for her.\n\nfeature abandon/accepted\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nWhen her pull-request has been accepted, Suzy can run\n\n::\n\n    flowhub feature accepted\n\n    Summary of actions:\n     - Latest objects fetched from canon\n     - Updated develop\n     - Deleted feature/accepted-feature from local repository\n     - Deleted feature/accepted-feature from origin\n     - Checked out branch develop\n\nfrom her feature branch, and Flowhub will clean things up a bit. She can also\nspecify a feature name, if she's not currently on the accepted branch.\n\nIf Suzy's feature is deemed a non-starter, and summarily rejected, Flowhub is\nthere to comfort her:\n\n::\n\n    flowhub feature abandon\n\n    Summary of actions:\n     - Deleted feature/abandoned-feature from local repository\n     - Deleted feature/accepted-feature from origin\n     - Checked out branch develop\n\nWhich will remove the feature branch she'd been working on.\n\nThe difference between ``accepted`` and ``abandon`` is that ``accepted`` will\ncomplain if the feature branch hasn't been fully merged into your trunk branch;\n``abandon`` doesn't care.\n\nfeature list\n++++++++++++\n\nAt any time, Suzy can get a list of her current features' names (she's\nbeen so prolific that she's lost track of them all).\n\n::\n\n    flowhub feature list\n      suzy-feature-the-first\n    * suzy-currently-checkedout-feature\n      # ...\n      suzy-feature-the-millionth\n\nrelease/hotfix contribute\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nWhen it's time for a release, Flowhub has your back as well. Just branch off the\ntip of the release, and work. When you're satisfied, run the ``release\ncontribute`` command *while that branch is checked out*:\n\n::\n\n    flowhub release contribute\n\nIt's very similar to the ``feature publish`` command, but the target of the\npull-request is the release branch, not the trunk.\n\n``hotfix contribute`` does the same thing, but for hotfixes.\n\nBoth ``contribute`` commands won't allow you to contribute branches that aren't\ndescended from release/hotfix branch (as appropriate).\n\nFor Managers\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAfter a while, Suzy is given push access to the original repository (the\nmaintainer cited her excellent branch organization as a key reason for the\npromotion).\n\nNow Suzy can make use of Flowhub's managerial commands.\n\nA milestone has been reached in her project, and it's time to get ready to\nrelease a new version (Suzy's repository is a good fit for ``git-flow`` - if\nGithub-flow were a better match for her, she wouldn't need the managerial\ncommands at all).\n\n::\n\n    flowhub release start 0.3 # or whatever you want to tag the release as\n\n    Summary of actions:\n     - New branch release/0.3 created, from branch develop\n     - Pushed branch release/0.3 to canon\n     - Checked out branch release/0.3\n\n    Bump the release version now!\n\nthis creates a new branch, off of develop, and sends it to github so that other\ndevelopers can start dotting i's and crossing t's. Flowhub will only allow one\nrelease branch at a time.\n\nWhen the release is polished to Suzy's satisfaction, she publishes the release:\n\n::\n\n    flowhub release publish # Suzy is on the release she wants to publish; she could also name it here.\n    Message for this tag (0.3): Lotta cool stuff here!\n\n    Summary of actions:\n     - Latest objects fetched from canon\n     - Branch release/0.3 merged into master\n     - New tag (0.3:\"Lotta cool stuf here!\") created at master's tip\n     - Branch release/0.3 merged into develop\n     - master, develop, and tags have been pushed to canon\n     - Branch release/0.3 removed\n     - Checked out branch develop\n\n\nA few days later, Suzy notices that a rare but seriously bad bug snuck\nthrough testing, and is affecting users. Suzy doesn't panic - she has Flowhub:\n\n::\n\n    flowhub hotfix start 0.3.1\n\n    Summary of actions:\n     - Latest objects fetched from canon\n     - Updated master\n     - New branch hotfix/0.3.1 created, from branch master\n     - Pushed hotfix/0.3.1 to canon\n     - Checked out branch hotfix/0.3.1\n\n    Bump the release version now!\n\nJust like releases, Flowhub will only let you have one hotfix branch going at a\ntime.\n\nWhen the bug's been killed, Suzy runs\n\n::\n\n    flowhub hotfix publish\n    Message for this tag (0.3.1): Sorry, guys.\n\n    Summary of actions:\n     - Branch hotfix/0.3.1 merged into master\n     - New tag (0.3.1:\"Sorry, guys.\") created at master's tip\n     - Branch hotfix/0.3.1 merged into develop\n     - master, develop and tags have been pushed to canon\n     - Branch hotfix/0.3.1 removed\n     - Checked out branch develop\n\nIf Suzy had been running a release branch at the time, the hotfix would have\nbeen merged into that instead of her trunk; the bug would have been killed in\ntrunk when the release was published.\n\nNow with Hooks!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFlowhub now supports hooks, specifically:\n\n* post-feature-start\n* pre-feature-publish\n* post-release-start\n* pre-release-publish\n* post-hotfix-start\n* pre-hotfix-publish\n\nEach of these should live in the standard ``.git/hooks`` directory. They're\nexactly like git's normal hooks, but Flowhub runs them (rather than Git).\n\nParameters for hooks\n++++++++++++++++++++\n\nSome hooks are passed parameters (just as standard githooks are). This is what\nthey are:\n\n* post-release-start\n\n  Passed the name of the release.\n* post-release-publish\n\n  Passed the name of the release.\n* post-hotfix-start\n\n  Passed the name of the hotfix.\n* post-hotfix-publish\n\n  Passed the name of the hotfix.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/haaksmash/flowhub", "keywords": null, "license": "UNKNOWN", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "flowhub", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/flowhub/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/flowhub/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://github.com/haaksmash/flowhub"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/flowhub/0.6.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Git-flow adapted for GitHub", "version": "0.6.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/haaksmash/flowhub\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"https://travis-ci.org/haaksmash/flowhub.svg?branch=master\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/c1d2860572ab523f15edd25de2edd0699435e483/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f6861616b736d6173682f666c6f776875622e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a>\n<p>Flowhub translates the workflow implemented by the excellent\n<a href=\"http://www.github.com/nvie/gitflow\" rel=\"nofollow\">git-flow</a> Git add-on to GitHub.</p>\n<p>Scott Chacon (of GitHub fame) points out that sometimes <tt><span class=\"pre\">git-flow</span></tt> isn\u2019t the\nbest workflow for an agile team.

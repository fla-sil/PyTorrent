As root \r\ntype::\r\n\r\n    python3 setup.py install\r\n\r\nThe installation directory is usually:\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.x/dist-utils\r\n\r\nHere you will find Baserip. Within Baserip you will find a \"share\" \r\ndirectory. In this there is a .desktop file and an icon. You can use \r\nthese to manually add an entry to your desktop menu system.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n============\r\n\r\nIn order to run Baserip you will need the following:\r\n\r\n* Python3\r\n* PyQt4\r\n* pyudev\r\n* mplayer/mencoder\r\n* lsdvd\r\n* lame\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE BASERIP\r\n==================\r\n\r\nPlease read the on-line documentation.\r\n\r\nBaserip - What's Next\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nI have been waiting for a fixed version of lsdvd to become available. With \r\nthe introduction of Ubuntu 14.10 this has been realized. Unfortunately both\r\nmencoder and ffmpeg have been dropped in favour of avconv and libav.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.2 of baserip will use avconv and this work is currently underway. \r\nThe libav library (and thus avconv) cannot read directly from a DVD drive so I have taken the decision to interface directly with libdvdread in order to present a data stream to avconv for processing. A side-effect of this is that there will no longer be a dependency on lsdvd but, as I am now working at a lower level, getting this code ready is going to take some time.\r\n\r\nI do have some code ready with a few enhancements above the 0.1 release including more output containers and more selection over the audio encoding and audio bit rate but because I cannot install ffmpeg along side libav I cannot test this code. If anyone is willing to test for me and maybe even fix any problems then I can release version 0.2 and thus the avconv based version will become version 0.3.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in helping out then please contact me at:\r\n\r\n* geoff (at) electron dot me dot uk\r\n\r\nand I will send you the latest code (minus the libav work).

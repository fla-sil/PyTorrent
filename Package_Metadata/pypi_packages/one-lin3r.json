For example if you typed `use capabilities` and clicked tab, it would be replaced with `use linux/bash/list_all_capabilities` and so on. I can see your smile, You are welcome!\n  + If you typed any wrong command then pressed enter, the framework will tell you what is the nearest command to what you have typed which could be the one you really wanted.\n  + Some less impressive things like auto-complete for variables after `set` command, auto-complete for liners after `use` and `info` commands and finally it converts all uppercase to lowercase automatically just-in-case you switched cases by mistake while typing.\n  + Finally, you'll find your normal auto-completion things you were using before, like commands auto-completion and persistent history, etc...\n\n- Automation\n  - You can automatically copy the liner you want to clipboard with command `copy <liner>` instead of using `use <liner>` and then copying it which saves a lot of time, of course, if you merged it with the following features.\n  - As you may noticed, you can use a resource file from command-line arguments before starting the framework itself or send commands directly.\n  - Inside the framework you can use `makerc` command like in Metasploit but this time it only saves the correct important commands.\n  - There are `history` and `resource` commands so you don't need to exit the framework.\n  - You can execute as many commands as you want at the same time by splitting them with semi-colon.\n  + Searching for any liner here is so easy and accurate, you can search for a liner by its name, function, description, author who added the liner to the framework or even the liner itself.\n\n\n- You can add your own liners by [following these steps](https://github.com/D4Vinci/One-Lin3r/wiki) to create a liner as a python file. After that you can make a Pull request with it then it will be added in the framework and credited with your name of course :smile:.\n- The ability to reload the database if you added any liner without restarting the framework.\n- You can add any platform to the liners database just by making a folder in liners folder and creating a \".liner\" file there.\n- More...\n\n>Note: The liners database is not too big but it will get bigger with updates and contributions.\n\n# Usage\n\n## Command-line arguments\n```\nusage: one-lin3r [-h] [-r R] [-x X] [-q]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n  -r          Execute a resource file (history file).\n  -x          Execute a specific command (use ; for multiples).\n  -q          Quiet mode (no banner).\n```\n\n## Framework commands\n```\nCommand                     Description\n--------                    -------------\nhelp/?

(Ex: Kali, Ubuntu..):\n  ```\n  git clone https://github.com/D4Vinci/One-Lin3r.git\n  sudo apt install libncurses5-dev\n  sudo pip3 install ./One-Lin3r --user\n  one-lin3r -h\n  ```\n  + For the rest Linux distros.:\n  ```\n  git clone https://github.com/D4Vinci/One-Lin3r.git\n  sudo pip3 install ./One-Lin3r --user\n  one-lin3r -h\n  ```\n\n## Updating the framework or the database\n- If you installed it from pip do:\n```\npip install one-lin3r --upgrade\n```\n- If you installed it from GitHub do:\n  - On Linux while outside the directory\n  ```\n  cd One-Lin3r && git pull && cd ..\n  pip3 install ./One-Lin3r --upgrade\n  ```\n  - On Windows if you don't have git installed, re-download the framework zipped!\n\n> Note: The liners are written as python modules, so it's considered as a part of the framework. So every new liner added to the framework, its version will get updated.\n\n## Contact\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/D4Vinci1)\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/D4Vinci_0x)\n\n## Donation\nIf my work has been useful for you, feel free to thank me by buying me a coffee or more :)\n\n[![Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://buymeacoffee.com/d4vinci)\n\n## Disclaimer\nOne-Lin3r is created to help in penetration testing and it's not responsible for any misuse or illegal purposes.\n\nCopying a code from this tool or using it in another tool is accepted as you mention where you got it from :smile:.\n\n> Pull requests are always welcomed :D\n\n## Credits and references\n- [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/)\n- [PowerSploit repo](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit)\n- [arno0x0x -

In particular, cookies encourage developers to rely on ambient authority for authentication, often becoming vulnerable to attacks such as cross-site request forgery. Also, when storing session identifiers in cookies, developers often create session fixation vulnerabilities. Transport-layer encryption, such as that employed in HTTPS, is insufficient to prevent a network attacker from obtaining or altering a victim's cookies because the cookie protocol itself has various vulnerabilities. In addition, by default, cookies do not provide confidentiality or integrity from network attackers, even when used in conjunction with HTTPS.\nSecurity Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-8\nRecommendations: Please at least read these references: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-8 and https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet#Cookies.\nCWE: CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\nCWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/614.html\n\nHeader Field Name: Accept-Ranges\nValue: none\nReference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-2.3\nSecurity Description: Unconstrained multiple range requests are susceptible to denial-of-service attacks because the effort required to request many overlapping ranges of the same data is tiny compared to the time, memory, and bandwidth consumed by attempting to serve the requested data in many parts.\nSecurity Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-6\nRecommendations: Servers ought to ignore, coalesce, or reject egregious range requests, such as requests for more than two overlapping ranges or for many small ranges in a single set, particularly when the ranges are requested out of order for no apparent reason.\nCWE: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\nCWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html\n\nHeader Field Name: Server\nValue: gws\nReference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.4.2\nSecurity Description: Overly long and detailed Server field values increase response latency and potentially reveal internal implementation details that might make it (slightly) easier for attackers to find and exploit known security holes.\nSecurity Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.4.2\nRecommendations: An origin server SHOULD NOT generate a Server field containing needlessly fine-grained detail and SHOULD limit the addition of subproducts by third parties.\nCWE: CWE-200: Information Exposure\nCWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html\n\nHeader Field Name: Cache-Control\nValue: private, max-age=0\nReference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.2\nSecurity Description: Caches expose additional potential vulnerabilities, since the contents of the cache represent an attractive target for malicious exploitation.  Because cache contents persist after an HTTP request is complete, an attack on the cache can reveal information long after a user believes that the information has been removed from the network.  Therefore, cache contents need to be protected as sensitive information.\nSecurity Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-8\nRecommendations: Do not store unnecessarily sensitive information in the cache.\nCWE: CWE-524: Information Exposure Through Caching\nCWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/524.html\n\nHeader Field Name: P3P\nValue: CP=\"This is not a P3P policy!

Clients that do so risk drawing incorrect conclusions, which might expose additional security risks (e.g., \"privilege escalation\").\nSecurity Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5\nRecommendations: Properly configure their origin server to provide the correct Content-Type for a given representation.\nCWE: CWE-430: Deployment of Wrong Handler\nCWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/430.html\n\nHeader Field Name: X-Frame-Options\nValue: SAMEORIGIN\nReference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034\nSecurity Description: The use of \"X-Frame-Options\" allows a web page from host B to declare that its content (for example, a button, links, text, etc.) must not be displayed in a frame (<frame> or <iframe>) of another page (e.g., from host A). This is done by a policy declared in the HTTP header and enforced by browser implementations.\nSecurity Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034\nRecommendations:  In 2009 and 2010, many browser vendors ([Microsoft-X-Frame-Options] and [Mozilla-X-Frame-Options]) introduced the use of a non-standard HTTP [RFC2616] header field \"X-Frame-Options\" to protect against clickjacking.

When the Cache-Control header field is also present and understood in a request, Pragma is ignored. Define \"Pragma: no-cache\" whenever is possible.\nCWE: CWE-524: Information Exposure Through Caching\nCWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/524.html\n\nHeader Field Name: Public-Key-Pins\nReference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7469\nSecurity Description: HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) is a trust on first use security mechanism which protects HTTPS websites from impersonation using fraudulent certificates issued by compromised certificate authorities. The security context or pinset data is supplied by the site or origin.\nSecurity Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7469\nRecommendations: Deploying Public Key Pinning (PKP) safely will require operational and organizational maturity due to the risk that hosts may make themselves unavailable by pinning to a set of SPKIs that becomes invalid. With care, host operators can greatly reduce the risk of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and other false- authentication problems for their users without incurring undue risk. PKP is meant to be used together with HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) [RFC6797], but it is possible to pin keys without requiring HSTS.\nCWE: CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\nCWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html\n\nHeader Field Name: Public-Key-Pins-Report-Only\nReference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7469\nSecurity Description: HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) is a trust on first use security mechanism which protects HTTPS websites from impersonation using fraudulent certificates issued by compromised certificate authorities.

It allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should only interact with it using secure HTTPS connections, and never via the insecure HTTP protocol. HSTS is an IETF standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797.\nSecurity Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797\nRecommendations: Please at least read this reference: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security.\nCWE: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\nCWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html\n\nHeader Field Name: Frame-Options\nReference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034\nSecurity Description: The use of \"X-Frame-Options\" allows a web page from host B to declare that its content (for example, a button, links, text, etc.) must not be displayed in a frame (<frame> or <iframe>) of another page (e.g., from host A).

This also applies to Google Chrome, when downloading extensions. This reduces exposure to drive-by download attacks and sites serving user uploaded content that, by clever naming, could be treated by MSIE as executable or dynamic HTML files.\nSecurity Reference: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/List_of_useful_HTTP_headers\nRecommendations: Always use the only defined value, \"nosniff\".\nCWE: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\nCWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html\n\nHeader Field Name: Content-Security-Policy\nReference: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/\nSecurity Description: Content Security Policy requires careful tuning and precise definition of the policy.

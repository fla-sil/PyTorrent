Still, this \u201chard\u201d part of the tutorial will have to be\nfollowed only once ;)!\n\n1 - Getting your Twitter Developer Account\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAs I\u2019m providing the complete code of this project, I can\u2019t let you guys\nuse my API keys, so you need to get them yourselves. This is how you do\nit:\n\n-  Access `this link <https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply/user>`__ to\n   associate your Twitter profile with a developer account\n-  Click in ``Continue``\n-  Check \u201cI am requesting access for my own personal use\u201d\n-  Type in your username on the field below\n-  Select the country you live and press ``Continue``\n-  Check \u201cConsumer / end-user experience\u201d\n-  In the textbox below, type something similar to the following example\n   (note that it is better not to copy the whole text, so that your\n   application will be approved faster):\n\n::\n\n   The project I'm building aims to identify and block follower bots. It is based on programming language Python, using Tweepy to connect to Twitter API and Botometer to identify bots. The project gives the user mutiple options on identifying and blocking the bots, resulting in a clean and simple usage. Botometer analizes each profile basing itself on the tweets and the specs of the profile, to, then, calculate a result (a score from 0 to 5; the higher, the more likely it is that the profile is indeed a bot). None of the results are shared with anyone or kept with us.\n\n-  Check ``No`` and click ``Continue``\n-  Scroll through the terms of service and check the \u201cread and agree\u201d\n   box\n-  Click on \u201cSubmit application\u201d\n-  Check your email account and confirm your email\n-  Wait for your Developer Account to get approved\n\n2 - Getting your Twitter API Keys\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOnce your Developer Account gets approved, you can pass on to creating\nan app:\n\n-  Access `this link <https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps/create>`__\n   to register your app\n-  Chose an authentic name to your app and fill the first field\n-  In the textbox below, type something similar to the following\n   example:\n\n::\n\n   Python program to identify and block your bot followers on Twitter.\n\n-  Paste https://github.com/yanorestes/botblocker on the field below\n-  Skip to the last textbox and type in something similar to the\n   following example:\n\n::\n\n   The project I'm building aims to identify and block follower bots. It is based on programming language Python, using Tweepy to connect to Twitter API and Botometer to identify bots. The project gives the user mutiple options on identifying and blocking the bots, resulting in a clean and simple usage.\n\n-  Click on ``Create`` and confirm\n\nYou will be redirected to your app\u2019s page. Then:\n\n-  Access the \u201cKeys and tokens\u201d tab\n-  Save the two keys under \u201cConsumer API keys\u201d somewhere. The first is\n   your Consumer Key and the second is your Consumer Secret Key. You\n   will need both of them later configuring botblocker:\n\n.. image:: https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/HEvDXKu.png\n\n3 - Getting your Mashape API Key\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWith your Twitter API keys in hands, you\u2019ll only have to get your\nMashape API Key. Follow these steps in order to do so:\n\n-  Access `this link <https://market.mashape.com/>`__ and register an\n   account (I recommend signing up with GitHub, but there are other\n   options)\n-  If you have a credit card available (**you won\u2019t have to pay a single\n   dollar, don\u2019t worry!**), access `this\n   link <https://market.mashape.com/OSoMe/botometer-pro>`__, click on\n   ``Pricing`` and subscribe to the Basic Free Plan. If you don\u2019t, you\n   can use `this link <https://market.mashape.com/OSoMe/botometer>`__.\n   The first link will (probably) make the program run faster.\n-  On `this link <https://market.mashape.com/OSoMe/botometer>`__, copy\n   your personal \u201cX-Mashape-Key\u201d on the request example code and save\n   somewhere:\n\n.. image:: https://my.mixtape.moe/nqkagq.png\n\nUsing\n-----\n\nNow it\u2019s time to finally run botblocker! Botblocker you\u2019ll go through\nall of your followers and calculate a \u201cbot score\u201d of them. The score\ngoes from 0 to 5. The higher the score, the more likely is the chance\nthe profile is a bot. The default behaviour is to automatically block every profile identified as a bot.\n\nIf you installed the package using pip, you can simply run botblocker in\nthe command line:\n\n::\n\n   botblocker [-h] [-c] [--noblock] [--saveallowlist] [--softblock] [--report] [-l {1,2,3}] -u USER [-v]\n\nThese are the parameters you can use:\n\n-  ``-h`` or ``--help`` - Shows a help message and exit\n-  ``-c`` or ``--config`` - (Re)configure usage settings. At least once,\n   you\u2019ll have to do this.\n-  ``--noblock`` - Don\u2019t block anyone automatically. This is not recommended, especially for profiles with lots of followers, as you may lose all the running progress if you exit early.\n-  ``--saveallowlist`` - Save users identified as non-bots to an\n   allowlist. Recommended.\n-  ``--softblock`` - Do soft block (block and unblock right after)\n-  ``-r`` or ``--report`` - Report users identified as bots to Twitter\n-  ``-l {1,2,3}`` or ``-level {1,2,3}`` - Choose level of rigorosity to\n   use to identify bots. Level 1 only consider bots those with score >=\n   4, level 2 (default) considere those with score >= 3 and level 3\n   considere those with score >= 2.5.\n-  ``-u USER`` or ``-user USER`` - The Twitter username you want to run\n   botblocker for. Required.\n-  ``-v`` or ``--version`` - Get the current version of botblocker\n\nYou can also run the script directly by ``botblocker.py``:\n\n::\n\n   python -W ignore -m botblocker [-h] [-c] [--noblock] [--saveallowlist] [--softblock] [--report] [-l {1,2,3}] -u USER [-v]\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nI\u2019m accepting pull requests that improve speed and legibility of the\ncode.\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n-  **Yan Orestes** - *Initial work* -\n   `yanorestes <https://github.com/yanorestes>`__\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the\n`LICENSE <https://github.com/yanorestes/botblocker/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`__\nfile for details.", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/yanorestes/botblocker/archive/1.1.3.zip", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/yanorestes/botblocker", "keywords": "twitter bot blocker tweepy botometer", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "botblocker", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/botblocker/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/botblocker/", "project_urls": {"Download": "https://github.com/yanorestes/botblocker/archive/1.1.3.zip", "Homepage": "https://github.com/yanorestes/botblocker"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/botblocker/1.1.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">= 3.4", "summary": "Python script to identify and block your bot followers on Twitter", "version": "1.1.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>Python program to identify and block your bot followers on Twitter</p>\n<p>Requires 3.4 &lt;= Python &lt;= 3.7</p>\n<div id=\"getting-started\">\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on\nyour local machine for development and testing purposes.</p>\n<div id=\"installing\">\n<h3>Installing</h3>\n<p><strong>Only if you use Python &gt;= 3.7, you have to run this command first:</strong></p>\n<pre>sudo pip install https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy/archive/master.zip\n</pre>\n<p>Now, no matter what Python version you\u2019re using (if it fits the requirement), the easiest way is installing using pip:</p>\n<pre>sudo pip install botblocker\n</pre>\n<p>You can also clone this project using git:</p>\n<pre>git clone https://github.com/yanorestes/botblocker.git\ncd botblocker\npython setup.py install\n</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"preparation\">\n<h2>Preparation</h2>\n<p>At first, setting things up to botblocker may sound overcomplicated.\nHowever, following this step-by-step tutorial will ensure an easy\nproceedment!

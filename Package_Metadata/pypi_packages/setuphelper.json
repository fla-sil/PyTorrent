Instead of invoking the ``setup``\nfunction with a long list of keyword arguments, you just set\nglobal variables in your setup script and then invoke the\n``setup_main function``, passing ``globals()`` as its argument.\n(The SetupHelper setup.py script itself illustrates this usage.)\n\nThe helper module does all the grunt work of translating your\nvariables into keyword arguments, including automatically\ndeducing and generating many arguments so that you only have\nto specify a much simpler set of data. As a bonus, if you are\nusing Python's standard distutils, SetupHelper provides (very\nbasic!) support for the ``requires`` keyword, downloading and\ninstalling required packages for you, as long as their download\nURLs are available on PyPI. (You can also specify a local\ndirectory as a \"repository\" by setting the environment\nvariable ``PYPI_LOCAL`` to point to it--see the ``CHANGES``\nfile in the source archive for details.) This functionality\ncurrently does *not* support version specifiers after the\npackage name (unless you are using setuptools, which does\nallow this--see below).\n\n(Note that the Python 2.5 and later distutils package allows\nthe ``requires`` keyword in distribution metadata, but does\nnot actually use it to install anything for you. Of course\nsome distutils replacements like setuptools do provide this\nfunctionality; if you are using setuptools, you can set the\nvariable ``__distutils_pkg__`` to ``'setuptools'`` and\nSetupHelper will use setuptools' support instead of its own,\nwhich has some additional features, such as allowing version\nspecifiers for required packages. SetupHelper also adds the\n``requires``, ``provides``, and ``obsoletes`` keywords to\nyour package metadata when you use the ``setup.py register``\ncommand with Python versions < 2.5; in other words, it gives\nyou support for metadata version 1.1 even if your Python\nversion doesn't.)\n\nSince SetupHelper has all the information needed to determine\nwhat should be in your source or binary distribution files,\nit auto-generates ``MANIFEST.in`` each time it runs, so you don't\nhave to maintain your ``MANIFEST.in`` file manually (and if you\ndid, it would get overwritten anyway). Even though it is not\nstrictly necessary to write ``MANIFEST.in`` unless you are running\na distribution command, SetupHelper does it every time because\nchecking its output can often help you debug problems with the\nvariable definitions in your setup script. (At least, it has\ncertainly helped *me* to do that!)\n\nUsing SetupHelper as an Installer\n---------------------------------\n\nThis distribution includes a script, ``setuphelper``, that you\ncan use to leverage SetupHelper's ``requires`` keyword support\nto use it as an installer. Command line arguments to the\nscript are treated as a list of requirements to be installed,\nand the script uses SetupHelper to download and install them,\njust as if they were listed in a ``setup.py`` script. If you\nwant to use setuptools' ``easy_install`` support with this\ntechnique, use the command line option ``--use-setuptools``\n(short form ``-s``).\n\nSince this script uses the ``requires`` keyword functionality\nin SetupHelper, it has the limitation noted above, that no\nversion specifiers can currently be used after package names.\n\nPost-Install Script Support\n---------------------------\n\nAs one other bonus, SetupHelper allows you to automate the\nrunning of post-install scripts; just set the ``__post_install__``\nvariable in your ``setup.py`` to a list of script names to be run\nfrom a subshell (this is done using ``os.system``, so it has the\nlimitations of that Python command). It is desirable to allow\npost-install scripts to be run from ``setup.py`` so that SetupHelper\ncan ensure that any required packages are fully installed by\njust calling ``python setup.py install`` on them once they are\nunpacked. (Note that, if you are using setuptools, this feature\ndoes not work, as setuptools does not actually run\n``python setup.py install`` to install your package. A future\nversion of SetupHelper might lift this constraint.)\n\nNote that SetupHelper patches the ``install_scripts`` command in\n``distutils`` to capture the correct script installation directory.\nThis ensures that the correct version of your post-install scripts\n(i.e., the one that just got installed) runs even if there are\nmultiple copies on your path.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nOf course, to install SetupHelper, you can simply type::\n\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nin the directory where you unpacked the SetupHelper archive.\nHowever, since SetupHelper is used by setup scripts, you will\nprobably want to include it along with your ``setup.py`` in the\nsource archives for your Python projects as well as having it\ninstalled on your own system.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuphelper/setuphelper-0.5.1.tar.gz", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuphelper/0.5.1", "keywords": null, "license": "UNKNOWN", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "setuphelper", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/setuphelper/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/setuphelper/", "project_urls": {"Download": "http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuphelper/setuphelper-0.5.1.tar.gz", "Homepage": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuphelper/0.5.1"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/setuphelper/0.5.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A helper module for setup.py scripts.", "version": "0.5.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>This Python module will make your setup scripts simpler to\nwrite, by automating as much as possible of the \u2018boilerplate\u2019\nthat normally goes into them.

Think of it as an event equivalent to flyway,\nwhere you can define the mappings between events and have all incoming events upgraded to\na version your code can deal with, on the fly.\n\nThe target environment is either an event sourcing system, or microservices with\nan event bus - anywhere you're consuming events and doing something with them.\n\nPre-requisites\n==============\n\nAll events must be versioned. That is, there must be a version number in the event\nstructure somewhere.\n\nThere must be a way to map from a given event version to version+1 for every version number.\nThis is typically done by defining an upgrade method.\n\nThe library provides a class, `Upgrader`, which will take events in, extract the\nversion number, run all appropriate upgrade methods until the version is current, then\ncall an event factory with the upgraded data and return the appropriate object.\n\nDesign decisions (and whys)\n===========================\n\n* Factory is only called with the latest data, not for each version - this is to save\n  from having to maintain factories for every version.\n\n* Supporting Python 3.8 and above - because I want static types.\n\n* All events are dictionaries - for simplicity. Events are deepcopy'ed as part of the implementation.\n\n* Upgrade methods may mutate events in place - each event is provided as a deepcopy (so don't upgrade things that don't deepcopy).\n  If you return, that will be used - if not, the assumed mutated event will be used.\n\n* Upgrade methods will get dictionaries and return dictionaries, and wrapping will be invisible - because\n  I want this to be as simple to use as possible.\n\n* All versions should be strings, not numbers or other oddball things - for simplicity.\n\n* No version will be represented with str(None) (ie. 'None')\n\nHow to Use\n==========\n\nCreate a module that holds a bunch of version upgrade methods.\n\nEach method should use the `@pevl.event.upgrade` decorator, and in the decorator you specify a version number to apply to and a new-version number to set (otherwise you must set the new version number in the upgrade script itself).\n\nEach method should apply an appropriate upgrade from the version number given to the next version number.\n\nEach method should be named descriptively.\n\nEach method takes an event :dict, and returns an event: dict\n\nVersion numbers do not need to sort properly - but each version needs to upgrade to another version that is then handled (or not, if final version)\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nfrom pevl.event import upgrade\n\n@upgrade('v0.1', 'v0.2')\ndef split_first_last_name(event):\n    event['first'], event['last'] = event['name'].split()\n```\n\nThe code to upgrade the events:\n\n```python\nfrom pevl.event import Upgrader\n\nupgrader = event.Upgrader(upgrades=[split_first_name, ])\nupgraded = upgrader.ingest(event, target_version='v0.2')\n```\n\nFor an example of the code that does the upgrades, see `sample_sns.py`\n\nLikely Failure Modes\n====================\n\nMake sure your versions match what comes out of the event itself. str/int mismatches may be silently ignored.\n\nMake sure you have a version. Again, failed version matches may be ignored.\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/silarsis/pevl", "keywords": "event sourcing versioning", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "pevl", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pevl/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pevl/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/silarsis/pevl"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pevl/0.0.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.8", "summary": "Library to handle versions for events", "version": "0.0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>pevl</h1>\n<p>Python Event Versioning Library</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/9b85b656702ab8fafcda16cc32369c106d148349/68747470733a2f2f6769746875622e636f6d2f73696c61727369732f7065766c2f776f726b666c6f77732f507974686f6e2532304576656e7425323056657273696f6e696e672532304c69626172792f62616467652e737667\"></p>\n<p>This library provides code to upgrade events.

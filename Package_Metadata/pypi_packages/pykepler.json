Consequently, no attempt has been made to\ndevelop an user interface or to write programs for various use cases.\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\nMake sure your Unix installation has the GNU C compiler and build\ntools installed.

Python 2.6.5 (needed only if you use the Python interface)\n\nkepler can also be used with Microsoft Windows provided you have MinGW\nand MSYS installed.

In order to\ncall kepler's functions from your own applications, you will need to\ncreate your own makefile along the lines of the one in the 'examples'\nsubdirectory.\n\nRun 'make target={posix|windows} install' to deploy the shared library\nthat is created in the previous step. On most systems, you will need\nto run this as root.  You will need to do this before you run the\nexample programs or use the pykepler Python package. On Windows,\nplease copy src/libkepler.dll manually to your application or Windows\nsystem directory.\n\nRun 'make target={posix|windows} clean' to remove all the files\ncreated by running 'make'. This will not remove the shared libraries\nor symbolic links in /usr/lib.\n\nThe 'pykepler' subdirectory contains the sources for the pykepler\nPython package.  This package allows you to call kepler routines from\nPython.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe C library is documented in the file kepler.html under the 'doc'\nsubdirectory.\n\nThe 'pydoc' utility or the help() function in the interactive Python\ninterpreter may be used to view the documentation for the Python\ninterface.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nThe following sample programs may be found in the 'examples'\nsubdirectory:\n\n1. kepler_test.c calls most of the functions in kepler and displays\nthe results in a terminal window. To test the routines in mpc_file.c,\nyou must download the MPC Orbit Database files from <http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/MPCORB.html>.\n\n2. rise_set.c is a program that accepts command-line arguments and\ndisplays the rise, transit and setting times for the Sun, Moon,\nplanets and Pluto.\n\n3. planpos. py demonstrates the Python wrapper by calling routines in\nthe VSOP, ELP and Pluto modules to display the positions of the Sun,\nMoon, planets and Pluto at the time specified on the command-line.\n\n4. flightseg. py displays the great circle distance and bearing angles\nfor flight segments between the airports specified on the command\nline.  The airport database from <http://openflights.org/data.html>\nmust be downloaded into the examples folder.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nkepler is targeted towards users with a sound grasp of positional\nastronomy.  However, it has been thought fit to include references to\nthe relevant astronomical literature in the source code.\n\nNo work of this nature would be possible without the following\nstandard works on astronomical algorithms:\n\n1.

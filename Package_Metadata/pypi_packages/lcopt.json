Simply use:\n\n```python\nfrom lcopt.utils import lcopt_bw2_forwast_setup\nlcopt_bw2_forwast_setup()\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n\nBelow are the basic commands to get lcopt's interactive GUI up and running to create your first model. More detailed instructions are available in the [online documentation](https://lcopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2_use.html), including a [video runthrough](https://lcopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3_video_runthrough.html) of creating a simple model using the ecoinvent 3.3 database.\n\nLcopt saves models in your current working directory, so before launching it, `cd` to the folder you want to save your models in.\n\nLcopt is written in Python, so to use it open up a jupyter notebook or python shell and use the following commands\n\n### Importing Lcopt\n\nTo import lcopt use \n\n```python\nfrom lcopt import *\n```\n\n### Creating a new model\n\nTo create a model, you need to create an instance of the LcoptModel class using the model name as the first argument:\n\n```python\nmodel = LcoptModel('My First Model')\n```\n\nBy default the model will be populated in the background with the details to link to the ecoinvent 3.3 datasets. If you want your model to use FORWAST instead use:\n\n```python\nmodel = LcoptModel('My First FORWAST Model', useForwast=True)\n```\n\n### Loading an existing model\n\nTo load a model, make sure the file (*.lcopt) is in your working directory and use the model name (with or without the .lcopt extension) in this command:\n\n```python\nmodel = LcoptModel(load='My First Model')\n```\n\nNote : If you accidentally forget to use `load=` and you see a blank model don't panic. Lcopt won't overwrite your saved model unless you tell it to. Simply don't save the model and re-run the command with `load=`\n\n### Launching the GUI\n\nTo launch the GUI for your model simply call the `launch_interact` method of your newly created model instance:\n\n```python\nmodel.launch_interact()\n```\n\nThis will start a Flask server and launch your web browser to access the GUI. If it doesn't or you accidentally close the GUI tab, simply go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).\n\nInformation on how to use the GUI is located in 'More info...' panels dotted around at sensible locations within it.\n\nFor more details on using it, see the [documentation](https://lcopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2_use.html) or the [video](https://lcopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3_video_runthrough.html)\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you have any problems, questions, comments, feature requests etc. please [raise an issue here on github](https://github.com/pjamesjoyce/lcopt/issues)\n\nIf you want to contribute to Lcopt, you're more than welcome! Please fork the [github repository](https://github.com/pjamesjoyce/lcopt/) and open a pull request. \n\nLcopt uses [py.test](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/index.html>) and Travis for automated testing, so please accompany any new features with corresponding tests. See the `tests` folder in the [source code](https://github.com/pjamesjoyce/lcopt/tree/master/tests) for examples.

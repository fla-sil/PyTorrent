For this use the makefile, or the make.bat\nfile, contained on that folder.\n\nPrerequisites\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe project has been tested in the following versions of the interpreter:\n\n- Python 2.6\n- Python 2.7\n- Python 3.2\n- Python 3.3\n- Python 3.4\n- Pypy\n- Pypy 3\n- Jython\n\nAll other dependencies are indicated on the requirements.txt file.\nThe included makefile can install them with the command:\n\n``$ make requirements``\n\nInstalling\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe project is offered as a `Pypi package`_, and using pip is the preferred way\nto install it. For this use the following command;\n\n``$ pip install cookiecutter-python-library-demo``\n\nIf manual installation is required, the project includes a setup.py file, along\na makefile allowing direct installation of the library, which can be done with\nthe following command:\n\n``$ make install``\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe application has been coded in Python, without using any particular\nframework.\n\nCollaborate\n-----------\n\nAny kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:\n\n- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management\n- or forking the repository and extending the project\n\nIssues management\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIssues are managed at the GitHub `project issues tracker`_, where any Github\nuser may report bugs or ask for new features.\n\nGetting the code\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the `GitHub project page`_, where\nthe latest versions are always kept.

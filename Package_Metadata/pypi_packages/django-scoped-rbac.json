For example - list all resources within the contexts the user is authorized\n  to list resources.\n* Support assignment of roles within a security context.\n* Support an extensible mechanism for conditional policy expressions for permissions.\n* Support a JSON representation of the total permissions granted to a user for all\n  security contexts that can be shared with browser and other clients to enable\n  permissions-informed disclosure UI and UX\n\n\nSupport multiple security contexts within an application\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMost RBAC systems provide a simple permission model to answer permissions. For example,\nis the user authorized to POST a comment. In an application that supports multiple\nsecurity contexts the relevant context is an additional parameter required to determine\nif the user is authorised; that is is the user authorized to POST a comment to this\nproject vs another project. A user may be authorized to POST a comment to one project,\nbut not another.\n\n\nSupport for security contexts at the query level\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf every object has a security context property it's possible to always secure the\nqueries executed for a user request by adding the user's authorized security contexts as\nan \"IN\" condition restricting the scope of the query.\n\n\nSupport assignment of roles within a security context\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn most RBAC systems a user is assigned a role that is applicable across the entire\napplication. For example, a user may have a `Commenter` role granting the user the\npermission to post comments anywhere comments may be posted within the application. An\napplication that supports the assignment of a role within the scope of a specific\nsecurity context can restrict the assignment of the `Commenter` role to specific areas\nof an application. For example, a user may be assigned the `Commenter` role in `Project\n1` but not `Project 2`.\n\n\nSupport an extensible mechanism for conditional policy expressions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAnother limitation of most RBAC systems is the simplicity of their permissions - you are\neither authorized to perform an action or not. Supporting an extensible mechanism for\nconditional policy expression means that a permission may be conditionally granted\ndependant upon a variety of factors. For example, you may be granted the permission to\ncomment within a project only when a target resource within the scope of that project is\n\"open for community comments\" vs \"open for drafter comments\".\n\n\nSupport JSON representation of total permissions granted\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf a user has permission to perform an action, such as update a resource, it should be\npossible for a client to determine that this is the case and be able to decide whether\nto disclose editing capabilty for the resource to the user. That is, if I'm not\nauthorised to edit a resource the UI shouldn't offer me the opportunity to edit the\nresource.\n\nProviding a JSON representation of the user's total permissions, and a Javascript\nimplementation of the permissions policy engine, can provide a much richer user\nexperience.\n\n\nNote\n====\n\nThis project has been set up using PyScaffold 3.2.3.

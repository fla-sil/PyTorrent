The fields\n\"date\", \"name\" and \"amount\" are mandatory, but can be assigned to any column using\nthe wizard. The Balance field can be used to set the start and end balance. To set\nthe start balance correctly, no amount must be entered in the first line. It is\nbest to use the corresponding test files as a template.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install this module, you need to:\n\nDownload the module and add it to your Odoo addons folder. Afterward, log on to\nyour Odoo server and go to the Apps menu. Trigger the debug mode and update the\nlist by clicking on the \"Update Apps List\" link. Now install the module by\nclicking on the install button.\n\nAnother way to install this module is via the package management for Python\n(`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_).\n\nTo install our modules using the package manager make sure\n`odoo-autodiscover <https://pypi.org/project/odoo-autodiscover/>`_ is installed\ncorrectly. Then open a console and install the module by entering the following\ncommand:\n\n``pip install --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple <module>``\n\nThe module name consists of the Odoo version and the module name, where\nunderscores are replaced by a dash.\n\n**Module:** \n\n``odoo<version>-addon-<module_name>``\n\n**Example:**\n\n``sudo -H pip3 install --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple odoo11-addon-muk-utils``\n\nOnce the installation has been successfully completed, the app is already in the\ncorrect folder. Log on to your Odoo server and go to the Apps menu. Trigger the \ndebug mode and update the list by clicking on the \"Update Apps List\" link. Now\ninstall the module by clicking on the install button.\n\nThe biggest advantage of this variant is that you can now also update the app\nusing the \"pip\" command. To do this, enter the following command in your console:\n\n``pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple <module>``\n\nWhen the process is finished, restart your server and update the application in \nOdoo. The steps are the same as for the installation only the button has changed\nfrom \"Install\" to \"Upgrade\".\n\nYou can also view available Apps directly in our `repository <https://nexus.mukit.at/#browse/browse:odoo>`_\nand find a more detailed installation guide on our `website <https://mukit.at/page/open-source>`_.\n\nFor modules licensed under OPL-1, you will receive access data when you purchase\nthe module.

Restart the server\nand log on to your Odoo server. Select the Apps menu and upgrade the module by\nclicking on the upgrade button.\n\nIf you installed the module using the \"pip\" command, you can also update the\nmodule in the same way. Just type the following command into the console:\n\n``pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple <module>``\n\nWhen the process is finished, restart your server and update the application in \nOdoo, just like you would normally.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nNo additional configuration is needed to use this module.\n\nUsage\n=============\n\nGo to your Accounting Dashboard and click on \"Import Statement\" in your Bank Journal.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Mathias Markl <mathias.markl@mukit.at>\n\nImages\n------------\n\nSome pictures are based on or inspired by the icon set of Font Awesome:\n\n* `Font Awesome <https://fontawesome.com>`_\n\nAuthor & Maintainer\n----------\n\nThis module is maintained by the `MuK IT GmbH <https://www.mukit.at/>`_.\n\nMuK IT is an Austrian company specialized in customizing and extending Odoo.\nWe develop custom solutions for your individual needs to help you focus on\nyour strength and expertise to grow your business.\n\nIf you want to get in touch please contact us via mail\n(sale@mukit.at) or visit our website (https://mukit.at).\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://www.mukit.at", "keywords": "", "license": "AGPL-3", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "odoo12-addon-muk-account-bank-statement-import-sheet", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/odoo12-addon-muk-account-bank-statement-import-sheet/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/odoo12-addon-muk-account-bank-statement-import-sheet/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://www.mukit.at"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/odoo12-addon-muk-account-bank-statement-import-sheet/12.0.2.0.2/", "requires_dist": ["odoo12-addon-muk-account-accountant", "odoo (<12.1dev,>=12.0a)"], "requires_python": ">=3.5", "summary": "CSV/XLS/XLSX/ODS Import Wizard", "version": "12.0.2.0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            =========================<br>MuK Bank Statement Import<br>=========================<br><br>Import bank statements from a variety of formats directly into Odoo.

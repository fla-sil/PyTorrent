The original project, lead by `Miguel Araujo`_, stopped receiving update during early 2014. The problem grew with each Django upgrade, and more and more functionalities relied by it became deprecated.\n\nThis fork aims to provide support to modern Django versions, while maintain reasonable support for older versions. The plan is to support all officially supported major Django versions, and all versions between the oldest LTS version to the current version. For example, as of April 2015, the latest Django version is 1.8, while the oldest LTS version is 1.4, so the supported Django versions are 1.4\u20131.8.\n\nThe original django-crispy-forms README follows.\n\n\n.. _`django-crispy-forms`: https://github.com/maraujop/django-crispy-forms\n\n------\n\n\nThe best way to have Django_ DRY forms. Build programmatically reusable layouts out of components, having full control of the rendered HTML without writing HTML in templates. All this without breaking the standard way of doing things in Django, so it plays nice with any other form application.\n\nThe application mainly provides:\n\n* A filter named ``|crispy`` that will render elegant div based forms. Think of it as the built-in methods: ``as_table``, ``as_ul`` and ``as_p``. You cannot tune up the output, but it is easy to start using it.\n* A tag named ``{% crispy %}`` that will render a form based on your configuration and specific layout setup. This gives you amazing power without much hassle, helping you save tons of time.\n\nDjango-crispy-forms supports several frontend frameworks, such as Twitter `Bootstrap`_ (versions 2 and 3), `Uni-form`_ and Foundation. You can also easily adapt your custom company's one, creating your own, `see the docs`_ for more information. You can easily switch among them using ``CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK`` setting variable.\n\n.. _`Uni-form`: http://sprawsm.com/uni-form\n.. _`Bootstrap`: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html\n.. _`see the docs`: http://django-crispy-forms.rtfd.org\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\ndjango-crispy-forms is the new django-uni-form. django-uni-form was an application created by `Daniel Greenfeld`_ that I leaded since version 0.8.0.

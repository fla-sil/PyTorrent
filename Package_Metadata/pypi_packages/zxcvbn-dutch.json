The function will return a\nresult dictionary with the following keys:\n\nentropy            # bits\n\ncrack_time         # estimation of actual crack time, in seconds.\n\ncrack_time_display # same crack time, as a friendlier string:\n                   # \"instant\", \"6 minutes\", \"centuries\", etc.\n\nscore              # [0,1,2,3,4] if crack time is less than\n                   # [10**2, 10**4, 10**6, 10**8, Infinity].\n                   # (useful for implementing a strength bar.)\n\nmatch_sequence     # the list of patterns that zxcvbn based the\n                   # entropy calculation on.\n\ncalculation_time   # how long it took to calculate an answer,\n                   # in milliseconds. usually only a few ms.\n\nThe optional user_inputs argument is an array of strings that zxcvbn\nwill add to its internal dictionary. This can be whatever list of\nstrings you like, but is meant for user inputs from other fields of the\nform, like name and email. That way a password that includes the user's\npersonal info can be heavily penalized.

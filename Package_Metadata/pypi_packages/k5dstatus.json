If you use k5dstatus, send me feedback!*\n\nk5dstatus is a statusline generator for i3 that you can use to display\nsystem information you may be interested in. i3 comes with ``i3status``\nwhich has many limitations. It has no plugin interface. It has no\nsupport for events and relies on polling for all its information, which\nmakes it surprisingly heavy on resources. It has a weird config file\nformat that makes it difficult to configure.\n\nOther projects have come along to make up for these weaknesses and many\nof them do a great job. k5dstatus is for users who want a more flexible\nstatusline that can be achieved from editing options in a configuration\nfile but without having to learn a complicated plugin api to create\ncustom statusline entries.\n\nThis is accomplished by allowing users to update the statusline through\ninterprocess communication using\n`DBUS <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/>`__. k5dstatus\nexposes a DBUS service that you can use to update the statusline simply\nin pretty much any programming language and from any process (maybe even\nin a cron!).\n\n-  No configuration file is required\n-  Update the statusline from multiple processes\n-  Update the statusline from any language (even from the command line!)\n-  No complicated plugin api to learn\n\n\nRelation to i3-dstatus\n----------------------\n\nThis project is a source fork and rewrite of i3-dstatus.

It takes a text file written with jemdoc markup, an optional configuration file and an optional menu file, and makes static websites that look something like [this one](http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/).\n\n### Motivation\n\nThis revision to [jemdoc](https://github.com/jem/jemdoc) seeks to keep this utility tool abreast with modern standards in web development. Since 2007, new technologies and modifications have been made to HTML and CSS. Jemdoc, in its present state lacks some of the features of the [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) standard including basic HTML markup such as:\n\n- Semantic HTML tags\n- HTML Forms\n- Responsive web design\n\nIn addition, CSS3 has seen some changes as well. The most important feature concerning styling is the ability to use CSS Preprocessors, that have become common in the web development world.\n\nThis revision to jemdoc seeks to keep jemdoc abreast with these changes\n\n\n### Features\n\nThe first issue change in this version of jemdoc was stripping away the configuration setup the user had to manually make to start using jemdoc as described [here](https://jemdoc.jaboc.net/download.html). The only requirement now is for the user to have a python 2.7 interpreter and `pip2` available on his system. Follow the [installation](#Installation) to get started with jemdoc.\n\nSecondly, jemdoc now uses MathJax for mathematical equation rendering, instead of traditional Latex. Consequently, mathematical equations are no longer images on the generated HTML page and there is no need for the user to download or support Latex on his system.\n\nThis version of jemdoc takes a mobile-first approach to websites. With this approach in mind, the webpages generated by jemdoc are responsive to varying viewports and hence devices used to view the webpages. This improves the accessibility of jemdoc generated webpages on a plethora of devices.\n\nIn conjuction with the mobile-first approach, HTML5 introduced the idea of semantic tags. This project embraces semantic HTML5 tags as opposed to generic `<div>` tags.\n\nOver the course of the years, CSS preprocessors have arisen, introducing programming languge features such as variables to CSS stylesheets. This version of jemdoc supports three CSS preprocessors namely: SCSS, SASS and LESS. This gives users more flexibillity in styling their webpages.\n\nAdditionally, the original version of jemdoc lacked core HTML tags including `<form>`, `<audio>` and `<video>` tags. Now, these are available with jemdoc and users can embedded audio and video elements in jemdoc and create forms to receive input from users.\n\nThe possiblity most important feature in this version of jemdoc is the ability to create HTML classes and ids in `.jemdoc` files. This version of jemdoc takes a less opinionated approach in generating HTML webpages and gives some degree of freedom to the user. Moreover, the ability to add HTML classes and ids gives fine grained control over the styling of specific elements in the generated HTML page.\n\n\n### Installation\n\nTo install, make sure you have a python 2.7.\\* interpreter available on your laptop. [Download it here](https://github.com/sarpongdk/Python-2.7.-/blob/master/python-2.7.17-macosx10.9.pkg) if needed.\n\nExecute the following command in the console to download the jemdoc:\n\n```\npip install jemdoc\n```\n\n### Documentation\n\nTo be provided soon\n\n\n### Building source with `make`\n\nA Makefile has been provided for anyone that wants to build the source documents from scratch locally. The following commands serves as a guide for using the Makefile, assuming the user is currently at the root of whatever directory the user decides to build the project in\n\n```\nPlease use `make <target>' where <target> is one of\n  clean         to remove build files\n  clean-pyc     to remove .pyc files\n  build         to build the project for distribution\n  install       to install the project locally\n  create-env    to initialize project in a virtual environment in the current working directory\n  init    to download project dependencies from requirements.txt\n```\n\n\n### License\n\nThis work is the extension of the original jemdoc created by [Jacob Mattingley](https://github.com/jem).

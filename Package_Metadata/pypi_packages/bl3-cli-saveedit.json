It's a companion to the very similar\n[CLI editor for BL2/TPS](https://github.com/apocalyptech/borderlands2),\nand provides some very similar functionality.  It can be used\nto level up your characters, unlock Mayhem modes early in the\ngame, unlock TVHM, add SDUs, unlock equipment slots, and more.\n\nThis editor has only been tested on PC Savegames -- other platforms'\nsavegames are not supported at the moment.\n\nPlease keep the following in mind:\n\n- This app does not have any graphical interface.  You must be\n  on a commandline in order to use it.\n- It does not provide any mechanisms for creating items/weapons,\n  or editing items/weapons, apart from changing their levels.\n- It does not offer any direct ability to alter Guardian Rank status.\n- While I have not experienced any data loss with the app,\n  **take backups of your savegames before using this**, and\n  keep in mind that it could end up corrupting your saves.

It also requires the [protobuf package](https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/).\n\nThe easiest way to install this app is via `pip`/`pip3`.  Once Python 3 is\ninstalled, you should be able to run this to install the app:\n\n    pip3 install bl3-cli-saveedit\n\nOnce installed, there should be a few new commandline utilities available\nto you.  The main editor is `bl3-save-edit`, and you can see its possible\narguments with `-h`/`--help`:\n\n    bl3-save-edit -h\n\nThere's also a `bl3-save-info` utility which just shows some information\nabout a specified savefile.  You can see its possible arguments with\n`-h`/`--help` as well:\n\n    bl3-save-info -h\n\nIf you've got a raw savegame protobuf file that you've hand-edited (or\notherwise processed) that you'd like to import into an existing savegame,\nyou can do that with `bl3-save-import-protobuf`:\n\n    bl3-save-import-protobuf -h\n\nAlternatively, if you've got a savegame exported as JSON that you'd like\nto import into an existing savegame, you can do that with\n`bl3-save-import-json`:\n\n    bl3-save-import-json -h\n\nFinally, there's a utility which I'd used to generate my\n[BL3 Savegame Archive Page](http://apocalyptech.com/games/bl-saves/bl3.php).\nThis one won't be useful to anyone but me, but you can view its arguments\nas well, if you like:\n\n    bl3-process-archive-saves -h\n\nThere are also profile-specific versions of most of those commands, which\ncan be used to edit the main BL3 `profile.sav`:\n\n    bl3-profile-edit -h\n    bl3-profile-info -h\n    bl3-profile-import-protobuf -h\n    bl3-profile-import-json -h\n\n### Upgrading\n\nWhen a new version is available, you can update using `pip3` like so:\n\n    pip3 install --upgrade bl3-cli-saveedit\n\nYou can check your current version by running any of the apps with the\n`-V`/`--version` argument:\n\n    bl3-save-info --version\n\n### Notes for People Using Windows\n\nThis is a command-line utility, which means there's no graphical interface,\nand you'll have to run it from either a Windows `cmd.exe` prompt, or presumably\nrunning through PowerShell should work, too.  The first step is to\ninstall Python:\n\n- The recommended way is to [install Python from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).\n  Grab what's available in the 3.x series (at time of writing, that's either\n  3.8.2 or 3.7.7), and when it's installing, make sure to check the checkbox\n  which says something like \"add to PATH\", so that you can run Python from the\n  commandline directly.\n- If you're on Windows 10, you can apparently just type `python3` into a command\n  prompt to be taken to the Windows store, where you can install Python with\n  just one click.  I've heard reports that this method does *not* provide the\n  ability to add Python to your system PATH, though, so it's possible that\n  running it would be more complicated.\n\nWhen it's installed, test that you can run it from the commandline.  Open up\neither `cmd.exe` or PowerShell, and make sure that you see something like this\nwhen you run `python -V`:\n\n    C:\\> python -V\n    Python 3.8.2\n\nIf that works, you can then run the `pip3 install bl3-cli-saveedit` command\nas mentioned above, and use the commandline scripts to edit to your heart's\ncontent.\n\n### Running from Github\n\nAlternatively, if you want to download or run the Github version of\nthe app: clone the repository and then install `protobuf` (you can\nuse `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to do so, though a `pip3 install protobuf`\nwill also work just fine).\n\nYou can then run the scripts directly from the Github checkout, though\nyou'll have to use a slightly different syntax.  For instance, rather than\nrunning `bl3-save-edit -h` to get help for the main savegame editor, you\nwould run:\n\n    python -m bl3save.cli_edit -h\n\nThe equivalents for each of the commands are listed in their individual\nREADME files, linked below.\n\n### Finding Savegames\n\nThis app doesn't actually know *where* your savegames or profiles are located.\nWhen you give it a filename, it'll expect that the file lives in your \"current\"\ndirectory, unless the filename includes all its path information.  When launching\na `cmd.exe` on Windows, for instance, you'll probably start out in your home\ndirectory (`C:\\Users\\username`), but your savegames will actually live in a\ndirectory more like `C:\\Users\\username\\My Documents\\My Games\\Borderlands 3\\Saved\\SaveGames\\<numbers>\\`.\nThe easiest way to run the utilities is to just use `cd` to go into the dir\nwhere your saves are (or otherwise launch your commandline in the directory you\nwant).  Otherwise, you could copy the save into your main user dir (and then\ncopy back after editing), or even specify the full paths with the filenames.\n\n# Editor Usage\n\nFor instructions on using the Savegame portions of the editor, see\n[README-saves.md](README-saves.md).\n\nFOr instructions on using the Profile portions of the editor, see\n[README-profile.md](README-profile.md).\n\n# TODO\n\n- An edit-in-place option would probably not be a terrible idea.  Also\n  should possibly \"standardize\" the behavior of the JSON/Protobuf imports,\n  which are the only cases where the utils *expect* to overwrite an existing\n  file.\n- Additionally, there's probably no reason why the JSON/Protobuf imports\n  can't just *create* brand new files, rather than requiring you to overwrite\n  an existing one.  Perhaps that should actually be the *default* way those\n  things operate?\n- Would anyone appreciate an option to *delete* Fabricators?  Hm.\n- Perhaps an option to zero out Guardian Rank in both saves and profiles.\n- If we fail to read a savefile or profile, might be nice to *actually* check\n  if it's the other of profile-or-savefile, and give a more helpful message in\n  those cases.\n- Something a bit more Enum-like for various things in `__init__.py`; I\n  know that's not very Pythonic, but when dealing with extra-Python data\n  formats, one must sometimes make exceptions.\n- Unit tests?\n\n# Credits\n\nThe encryption/decryption stanzas in `BL3Save.__init__` and `BL3Save.save_to`\nwere [helpfully provided by Gibbed](https://twitter.com/gibbed/status/1246863435868049410?s=19)\n(rick 'at' gibbed 'dot' us), so many thanks for that!

Here's a few which could be more to your\nliking, if you didn't want to use this one for whatever reason:\n\n- [Baysix's Web-Based Editor](http://www.bl3editor.com) - Just web-based for\n  now; sourcecode release is still forthcoming.\n- [Raptor's CLI Tools](https://github.com/cfi2017/bl3-save) - These are written\n  in [Go](https://golang.org/), and the project has easy downloads for Windows,\n  Mac, and Linux (in addition to the sourcecode).\n- [FromDarkHell's Profile Editor](https://github.com/FromDarkHell/BL3ProfileEditor) -\n  Written in C#, has EXE downloads for ease of use on Windows.\n- [sandsmark's borderlands3-save-editor](https://github.com/sandsmark/borderlands3-save-editor) -\n  Written in C++ with Qt for GUI.  Is still in development.  Native downloads\n  for Windows, but should compile fine on other platforms.\n\n# Changelog\n\n**v1.5.1** - May 5, 2020\n - Fixed alphabetization of COV Buzzaxe room decoration.  In the game data it looks\n   like it's called \"Psycho Buzzaxe,\" but the actual in-game label is COV Buzzaxe.\n - Fixed name displays for \"regular\" (non-E-Tech, non-Legendary) Maliwan snipers and\n   Tediore pistols.\n - Updated item name mapping to distinguish between the blue-rarity mission reward\n   version of Redistributor from the legendary version from Maliwan Takedown.\n - Updated `bl3-process-archive-saves` to clear out some 3rd-playthrough data\n   which earlier versions had accidentally introduced *(only really of interest\n   to myself)*\n\n**v1.5.0** - April 28, 2020\n - Added ability to alter Mayhem level for items, both in savegames and profile.\n   `--item-mayhem-max` will set items to the max Mayhem level (`10`), or\n   `--item-mayhem-levels <num>` will set a specific level (`0` to remove Mayhem\n   from items entirely).\n - Item level reports when viewing contents or exporting items will include\n   the Mayhem levels\n - Info views will show the total number of available SDUs along with the\n   purchased count\n - Various internal code reorganization\n\n**v1.4.0** - April 23, 2020\n - Updated for the Cartels + Mayhem 2.0 patch:\n   - Update item/weapon handling to understand new serial number versions\n   - Added in new cosmetic unlocks\n   - Mayhem level can now be set as high as 10\n   - Extra SDU levels added\n   - Fixed a bug related to viewing vehicle unlocks, thanks to new game data\n - Introduction of profile editing utilities, via `bl3-profile-edit`,\n   `bl3-profile-info`, `bl3-profile-import-json`, and `bl3-profile-import-protobuf`.\n   The following functionality is supported:\n   - Importing/Exporting to both JSON and Protobuf\n   - Importing/Exporting items to/from the bank\n   - Altering the level of gear stored in the bank\n   - Unlocking all global customizations/cosmetics\n   - Alphabetizing the list of room decorations, trinkets, and weapon skins\n - Display changes for `bl3-save-info` - introduced individual arguments to\n   show more detailed information as-requested, instead of only having a\n   global `-v`/`--verbose` option:\n   - Added `-i`/`--items` argument, to show inventory information\n   - Added `--fast-travel` argument, to show unlocked fast travel stations\n   - Added `--all-challenges` argument, to list all challenges in the save file\n     and their statuses (note: this will be over 1.5k items!)\n   - Added `--all-missions` argument, to list all completed missions in addition\n     to active ones\n   - `-v`/`--verbose` now implies the four options above.\n - `bl3-save-info` will now also report on whether the savegame has finished the\n   main game or any of the DLCs.\n - Added `--unfinish-nvhm` option to `bl3-save-edit`, to completely clear out\n any TVHM data and pretend that NVHM was never finished.\n\n**v1.3.1** - April 14, 2020\n - Bah, forgot a few more README tweaks about the JSON export/import\n\n**v1.3.0** - April 14, 2020\n - Added `json` output type, to export the protobuf as encoded into JSON\n - Added `bl3-save-import-json` utility, to load JSON into a savegame\n\n**v1.2.2** - April 12, 2020\n - Updated README with some more specific Windows 10 installation advice.\n\n**v1.2.1** - April 12, 2020\n - Updated Credits section of the README with one more credit that I'd\n   wanted to put in but forgot. :)\n\n**v1.2.0** - April 12, 2020\n - Added ability to change item/weapon levels, using `--items-to-char`\n   or `--item-levels`\n - Item Imports will now *not* import Fabricators unless explicitly\n   told to with the `--allow-fabricator` option.\n - Item names and levels are now shown where appropriate:\n   - In verbose `bl3-save-info` output\n   - In item export files\n   - While importing items\n - Updated to Protobuf v3, which is what BL3 itself uses.  Now when we\n   re-save without any edits, the save should be identical to the\n   original savegame.\n - Item export will now be done without any encryption, so an item will\n   have the exact same item code regardless of where it came from\n   (previously, item codes would change every time the game was saved,\n   so the same item could have very different-looking codes)\n - Added `-V`/`--version` flag to show version number\n\n**v1.1.1** - April 7, 2020\n - Added in Citizen Science mission name.\n\n**v1.1.0** - April 7, 2020\n - Added `bl3-save-import-protobuf` command, to load a raw protobuf file\n   into an existing savegame.\n\n**v1.0.1** - April 5, 2020\n - Some saves include Eridium as an ammo type, presumably related to the\n   Fabricator.

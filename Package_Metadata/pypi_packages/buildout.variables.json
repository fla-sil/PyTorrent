They provide you with the possiblity to get unique indices based on a key and stored in a shared file. That way each buildout gets the same index for each key used. In the example above the key is the JOB_NAME environment variable (set by Jenkins for example) and the index starts at 0. If a buildout with a different JOB_NAME is run, then it will get the next free index.\n\nThe ``portbase`` option evaluates \"12{index}00\".format(index=index). Thus the\nfirst job will get 12000 and the second job 12100 and so on.\n\nThe ``port`` option declares a range of integers which can be used to get unique ports for whatever you need them for. The ``port-instance`` option uses that to declare a port which can be used with ${variables:port-instance} throughout the buildout and would be 12000 in this example. If you declare more, then up to 12099 will be possible before you get an error. Which variable\ngets which port is determined by lexical order of the variable name.\n\nThe ``jobname`` option takes ${env:JOB_NAME} and runs re.sub on it. In this example everything besides letters and numbers is replaced by an underscore.\n\nBesides integer ranges you can't use other dynamic variables from the same section.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nThanks to Legacy Parts Corporation and http://enquos.com for which this package was initially created.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.3 - 2013-03-15\n----------------\n\n* First official release.\n  [fschulze]\n\n\n0.2 - Unreleased\n----------------\n\n* Fix persisted index.\n  [fschulze]\n\n\n0.1 - Unreleased\n----------------\n\n* Initial version.\n  [fschulze (Florian Schulze)]", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/fschulze/buildout.variables", "keywords": null, "license": "GPL", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "buildout.variables", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/buildout.variables/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/buildout.variables/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://github.com/fschulze/buildout.variables"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/buildout.variables/0.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Provides dynamic variables in buildouts", "version": "0.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"buildout-variables\">\n<h2>buildout.variables</h2>\n<p>Provides dynamic variables in buildouts.</p>\n<p>An example use are unique DB names and conflict free parallel continuous integration runs on one machine.</p>\n<p>Example buildout section:</p>\n<pre>[variables]\nrecipe = buildout.variables\nindex-file = ${env:HOME}/jenkins-buildout-index.json\nindex-start = 0\nindex-key = ${env:JOB_NAME}\nportbase = indexed 12{index}00\nport = int portbase 0:100\nport-instance = new port\njobname = str \"${env:JOB_NAME}\" [^a-zA-Z0-9] _\n\n[env]\nrecipe = gocept.recipe.env\n</pre>\n<p>There are several things going on here.</p>\n<p>The first are the <tt>index-</tt> options.

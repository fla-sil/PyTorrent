Brown (LLNL, Livermore CA, 94550). This pure python software acts as an interface to [Experimental Nuclear Reaction Data (EXFOR)](https://www-nds.iaea.org/exfor/) that the [International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)](https://www-nds.iaea.org/nrdc/) actively maintains. \n\nThe database resembles a collection of experimental and evaluated nuclear data files in the EXFOR format (*.x4), a structured markup language. The mark-up language is quite complex and the data has legacy issues, such as data sets entered by hand or issues with the strict alignment criteria of FORTRAN-era punch cards. The documentation by David A. Brown describes a few basics of the format. Please use this [documentation](doc/x4i/x4i.pdf), the references therein and the other files in the [doc](doc) folder. Please also cite the papers about the database if you use these data in your research.\n\nThe main purpose of this fork is to ensure that such a valuable and complex tool does stays available. Also, the original link for this code is dead and Python 2 is deprecated. As a standalone pure Python package on pip, it may cure derived works from a potential GPL infection.  \n\n### History\n\nThis fork emerged originally in 2016 when we tried to benchmark current photo-nuclear interaction codes against experimental data in a project related to Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays. One paper that came out [has a quite useful plot (Figure 1)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05120-7). Actually, this figure is [an interactive matplotlib application](https://github.com/afedynitch/EXFOR-chart) that used the original `x4i` as a backend. When a box is clicked x4i gathers experimental data from EXFOR, applies some filtering and visualizes the data against pre-computed model predictions.\n\n### Examples\n\nNothing very useful yet. To check out if the installation is successful, try:\n\n        python examples/get-entry.py --data -s 10504002\n\nIt should print some fission cross section to stdout.\n\n### Contributions\n\n..are welcome. Also feel free to say hi since I don't know if there is a community who may find this interface useful. \n\nCurrently there is no development goals beyond basic maintenance.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- ~1 GB of hard drive space\n\n### Installation::\n\n    pip install x4i3\n\nNote that on first import ~600MB will be downloaded and 22k files will be decompressed to the data directory.\n\n### Support tools\n\nTo reduce the weight of this package, the database management tools have been moved to a different project [`x4i3_tools`](https://github.com/afedynitch/x4i3_tools) since these are for advanced users anyways.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThere is currently no separate documentation for `x4i3`. Please use the original [documentation](doc/x4i/x4i.pdf). The installation instruction are not valid anymore. There is a detailed but auto-generated [API-doc documentation](doc/x4i/). Untar and enjoy the `index.html` if you need this.\n\n### Authors:\n\n*David A.

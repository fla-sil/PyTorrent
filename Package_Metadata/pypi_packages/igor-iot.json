It can work together with other Igors \n(lending a hand) and with lesser servants such as [Iotsa-based devices](https://github.com/cwi-dis/iotsa).\n\nIgor includes a Certificate Authority implementation that allows you to use\nsecure communication over https on the local network (for Igor and for other applications like\nweb browsers).

It has a REST interface to communicate to the outside world, and it can emit requests as well.\nIt performs its tasks of managing your household by knowing three things:\n\n1. what is going on at the moment,\n2. what needs to happen when, and\n3. how to make that happen.\n\nIgor has a plugin mechanism, and you can add plugins for all kinds of sensors (point 1). You can also add plugins that can control external devies (point 3). Finally you add rules to connect these (point 2).\n\nIgor has a web interface to allow you to control and maintain it.\nIt also comes with a number of useful plugins and a set of Python modules and command line utilities that interact with it.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFormatted documentation is available online, at <https://igor-iot.readthedocs.io>.\n\nWhen viewing source documentation is also available [here](doc/index.rst). \n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nYou need to have Python 3.6 or later installed.\n(Python 2.7 is also still supported but Python 3 is preferred).\n\nYou need the _pip_ package manager for the version of Python that you are going to use.\n\n```\npython3 -m pip install igor-iot\n```\n\nAfter that follow the instructions in <https://igor-iot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html>\nor [doc/setup.rst](doc/setup.rst) to setup your Igor system.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/cwi-dis/igor", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "igor-iot", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/igor-iot/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/igor-iot/", "project_urls": {"Documentation": "https://igor-iot.readthedocs.io", "Homepage": "https://github.com/cwi-dis/igor", "Issue tracker": "https://github.com/cwi-dis/igor/issues"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/igor-iot/0.99.1/", "requires_dist": ["future", "httplib2", "requests", "flask", "gevent", "python-dateutil", "py-dom-xpath-six", "passlib", "pyjwt", "pyopenssl", "markdown"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "REST-like IoT server", "version": "0.99.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Igor, your personal IoT butler</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/cwi-dis/igor\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Build Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/5873ed3e9c01ce002ed7d17269e706c7120f2b9c/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f6377692d6469732f69676f722e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://coveralls.io/github/cwi-dis/igor?branch=master\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Coverage Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/0496922c7960f07e359dec2bf148adf54677436e/68747470733a2f2f636f766572616c6c732e696f2f7265706f732f6769746875622f6377692d6469732f69676f722f62616467652e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://igor-iot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Documentation status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/9ef28af8159a9c03628fad5c97a87a10404e3667/68747470733a2f2f72656164746865646f63732e6f72672f70726f6a656374732f69676f722d696f742f62616467652f\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://badge.fury.io/py/igor-iot\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"PyPI version\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/f2506a69cbf54861ecad643e55126ca7119017c3/68747470733a2f2f62616467652e667572792e696f2f70792f69676f722d696f742e737667\"></a></p>\n<p>Igor is named after the Discworld characters of the same name.\nYou should think of it as a butler (or valet, or majordomo,\nwhatever the difference is) that knows everything\nthat goes on in your household, and makes sure everything runs smoothly.\nIt performs its tasks without passing judgements and maintains complete\ndiscretion, even within the household.

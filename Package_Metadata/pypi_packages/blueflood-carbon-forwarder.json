However, if your application needs to deserialize objects at a faster rate, and the input is already known to be secure, the `get_unpickler` can made to return the default, insecure pickler.\r\n\r\n# Failure Considerations\r\n\r\nErrors in operation will naturally fall into two realms, input and output.\r\nErrors on the inbound side will be related to the pickled data coming from carbon.\r\nErrors on the outbound side will be unexpected (or missing or erroneous) HTTP responses from the blueflood instance to which the metrics are being sent.\r\n\r\n## Accepting metrics in pickle format:\r\n\r\nIf a properly formatted pickle message is truncated during transmission, the metric won't be recorded, and no error or exception will be logged.\r\n\r\nIf a pickle message is not properly formatted (e.g. if `payload` gets truncated in `sendPickle.py` before `handle` is set), then the unpickler will raise `EOFError` and the exception will be written to the log.\r\n\r\n## Forwarding metrics via HTTP:\r\n\r\nThe forwarder sends metrics to blueflood via an HTTP POST request to the `/v2.0/${tenant}/ingest` path.\r\nFor the most part, the response from that request is ignored. The response code _is_ checked, however.\r\nIf the response code is `200`, `201`, `202`, `204`, or `207`, the forwarder assumes that the request succeeded, and that the metrics were successfully ingested.\r\nHowever, if the response code is anything else, then the behavior is a little more complex (see [Technical Details](#technical-details) below).\r\nIt is important to note that, if the response code is not one of the above (`200`, `201`, `202`, `204`, or `207`), then NO ERROR OR EXCEPTION IS LOGGED.\r\nThe response code received from the server _is_ logged, however.\r\nIf you want to know if there were any errors, you'll have to check the log.\r\n\r\nThere isn't any significant error handling logic in the code itself, but we can suggest some course of action based on the response code:\r\n\r\n - 207: Problematic. This is a multi-status response. The response body will contain the resultant responses of multiple operations aggregated into a single document. It's in the 2xx range, but that doesn't mean that all (or even any) of the combined operations succeeded. `BluefloodEndpoint` always treats `207` as a success, so if some metrics were rejected for some reason, it will _not_ try to resend them and they will be lost forever. This should probably be fixed in the forwarder, unless we can replace it with something else.\r\n - 401 or 403: Authentication failure. Double check the `tenant`, `key`, and `auth_url` config settings and try again.\r\n - 429: This response means that rate limits were exceeded. Usually, per-second or per-minute limits will have reset by the time the forwarder retries. If it continues to be a problem, settings the `interval` option to a larger number of seconds may help.\r\n - 5xx: This is a server-side error on blueflood's part. There are not any settings on the forwarder that can work around it.\r\n\r\n## Technical Details:\r\n\r\nThere are two levels of \"batching\":\r\n - `MetricCollection._metrics`\r\n - `BluefloodEndpoint._json_buffer`\r\n\r\nWhen the `interval` elapses, metric data will be moved from `_metrics` to `_json_buffer`.\r\nThen, the `BluefloodEndpoint` will attempt to send the them to blueflood via HTTP.\r\nIf the HTTP request succeeds, then `_json_buffer` will be emptied.\r\nIf the request does not succeed, then the metrics will stay in the `Json_buffer` and be included in the next HTTP request.\r\nThe process is additionally complicated by the fact that the HTTP request is _only made if there is data in `metrics` waiting to be sent_.\r\nIf there is data in `_json_buffer` but not in `_metrics`, no attempt will be made to send them, and the data will just sit around in `_json_buffer`.\r\n\r\n## Change Log: \r\n\r\n0.4.1 \r\n- Add overwrite_collection_timestamp config (set to false by default) to have the forwarder use system time for collectionTime when sending to rackspace metrics for ingestion. \r\n\r\n0.4.2 \r\n- Add config for protocol to specify which listening protocol class to use; default to previous version of MetricPickleReceiver.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/rackerlabs/blueflood-carbon-forwarder", "keywords": "", "license": "Apache Software License", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "blueflood-carbon-forwarder", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/blueflood-carbon-forwarder/", "platform": "any", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/blueflood-carbon-forwarder/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/rackerlabs/blueflood-carbon-forwarder"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/blueflood-carbon-forwarder/0.4.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Sending graphite metrics to blueflood", "version": "0.4.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            # Description\n<br>\n<br>Graphite _'backend'_.

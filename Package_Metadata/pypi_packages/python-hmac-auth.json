Interface with a REST API that uses\n[jersey-hmac-auth](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/jersey-hmac-auth) to implement HMAC authentication, and \n2. Use the Python [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org) library to make API calls. \n\nIt works by providing a custom authenticator for the Requests library that modifies outgoing API calls to encode\nthe requests for HMAC authentication.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo install:\n\n```python\npip install python-hmac-auth\n```\n\nIn your code, import the `HmacAuth` class and specify it on the `auth` parameter when issuing API calls:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom python_hmac_auth import HmacAuth\n\nresponse = requests.get('http://example.com/api', auth=HmacAuth('your_api_key', 'your_secret_key'))\n```\n\n## User Guide\n\nSee the [User Guide](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/jersey-hmac-auth/wiki) for jersey-hmac-auth for more details \nabout HMAC authentication on the server and for clients libraries.\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo get the code:\n\n```sh\n$ git clone git@github.com:bazaarvoice/python-hmac-auth.git\n```\n\nTo submit a new request or issue, please visit the [Issues](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/python-hmac-auth/issues) page.\n\nPull requests are always welcome.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/bazaarvoice/python-hmac-auth", "keywords": null, "license": "Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

Any video file, or one of the attached camera device on a computer can be used as a video source for streaming.\n\n### A Note to Users\n\nThis program provides `video_streamer` package, but is also a working implementation using that package to show some of the features we can get using it. So, it might have bugs. \n\n### A Note to Developers\n\nThe main focus of the package is to make it easy to get video frame by frame (thanks to [opencv](https://opencv.org)), from any computer on the network, which can then be modified in any way preferable. </br>\n\nThe package provides `video_streamer.py` module with following main classes -\n\n* `MasterVideoIter` to get the video frame by frame from a camera or video file available in a computer.\n* `SlaveVideoIter` to get get the video frame by frame over a network using sockets.\n\n`stream_server.py` is somewhat complicated implementation which uses `MasterVideoIter` to read video and make it available to any program using `SlaveVideoIter`\n\nThen there is the `dataclass_objects.py` module providing following main dataclasses -\n\n* `StreamData` currently only holding `frame`, meaning that `SlaveVideoIter` receives and makes available one video frame at a time. It can be easily extended to include more data per frame, like perhaps an audio frame, making this a complete video with audio streaming program.\n* `PreStreamDataByClient` and `PreStreamDataByServer` are only containers which are shared by client and the server before the streaming starts. Gives them a chance to negotiate settings, other data, etc.\n\n## Features\n\n* `lvs start` runs the server, and multiple clients can connect to it. Fewer clients will result in better performance generally.\n* Server sleeps in 2 seconds intervals until a client requests the stream.\n  * Advantage - Video file or camera is not used when no clients connect, making the source available for use by other services in the meantime, and does not waste processing power.\n  * Disadvantage - While the camera will always return what it captures right now, Video file will be read from the beginning each time the server wakes up from the sleep.\n* Sweep interval can be set for saved videos which deletes old video files ending with '.avi' in the filename\n* Stream can be requested to include datetime information, with preferred text color, etc. Grayscale(black and white) stream can also be requested instead of colored.\n* Following extensions connect to the running server to provide additional services -\n  * `lvs e_http` extends stream service to clients using browser. Closes connection to the server and sleeps in 2 seconds intervals just like the server itself if no client(s) are connected for 10 seconds.\n  * `lvs e_view` opens up a window showing video stream. Press `q` or `Q` when this window is selected to stop the video stream.\n  * `lvs e_save` saves the video stream in one of the two given ways -\n    * Keeps saving video stream continuously in specified length chunks.\n    * Saves video of specified length chuck when detection occurs based on provided cascade classifier file\n\n## Installation\n\nRequires python 3.7 or above installed and available in `PATH`\n\n### Windows Users\n\n* Go to [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads), and download python.\n* Open downloaded file, select `Add Python 3.* to PATH`, and click `Install Now`\n\n### Linux Users\n\n* Install python3.7 or above using your linux distribution specific package manager.\nFor ubuntu, you can install it by entering `sudo apt install python3.7` in the terminal\n\n### Installing lvs\n\nOpen command prompt or terminal, and enter `python3 -m pip install lvs`</br>\nThis should install lvs and all its dependencies.\n\n## Usage\n\n* First of all, I would encourage to have a look at or modify the default configuration file, because this configuration is the heart of this app's behavior. You can view it in terminal by typing `lvs cfg`, or better yet open it in your preferred editor. The file location can be found by entering `lvs cfg_path`. Most settings available in this configuration files can be overridden on the command line. This file contains comments which I hope will be very helpful to understand the program's requirements for use.

As each member is added to the Google Group for the first time, the chapter whose mailing list they were added to is recorded in the Airtable. The member will not be added again, even if they are removed from the Google Group. This is so that the members can unsubscribe themselves from the Google Group without us having to use heuristics to figure out whether they unsubscribed or just weren't added.\r\n\r\n## Run\r\n\r\nTo sync the Google Groups Mailing Lists from the data in Airtable, run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ make sync\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nYou need a client_secret.json to authenticate with Google user with the following scopes: \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group\", \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.member\".\r\n\r\nYou also need AIRTABLE_API_KEY set in your env.\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ make test-sync\r\n```", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/directactioneverywhere/dxe-airtable", "keywords": "development", "license": "GPL-3.0", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "dxe-airtable", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dxe-airtable/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dxe-airtable/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/directactioneverywhere/dxe-airtable"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dxe-airtable/1.0.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Airtable library files used by DxE tech.", "version": "1.0.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            # Airtable Backup\n<br>\n<br>Backs up the Airtable data to S3.\n<br>\n<br>##How To Inspect The Airtable Backups\n<br>\n<br>###Access\n<br>\n<br>The backups are stored in Amazon's S3 storage service.

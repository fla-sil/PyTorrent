The following may or may not have been incorporated upstream by the time you\r\nread this:\r\n\r\n1. Added in a be.bat and be.py as a command\r\n\r\n2. Hacked around Windows's inability for parent processes to set the stdin/stdout\r\ncharset for child processes by going via environment variables, namely\r\nBE_INPUT_ENCODING and BE_OUTPUT_ENCODING. You can use these to get the BE process\r\nto interpret stdin and stdout as UTF-8 or whatever.\r\n\r\n3. Hacked a version generating script (!Generate_version.bat) as most Windows folk\r\nwon't have sed and awk kicking around.\r\n\r\n4. Made several hacks to enable BE running from within a ZIP archive. This lets you\r\npackage up BE into a self contained Windows install which is extremely useful for\r\nBEurtle's purposes. You'll need bbfreeze (easy_install bbfreeze) for the script\r\n!Generate_exe_bbfreeze.py to work, and it will spit out a self-contained directory\r\ninto dist.\r\n\r\n5. Added be vcs, a thin wrapper for the VCS API in the storage backend. This lets\r\nyou talk to the underlying VCS via BE rather than having to write your own VCS\r\nsupport code. This lets BEurtle drop its VCS support code entirely which is great.\r\n\r\nNote that I haven't had any success with getting BE to run under IronPython. It also\r\ncrashes out an IronPython compile. Furthermore I haven't got PyInstaller to work, nor\r\npy2exe. You can see their scripts in the notworking directory. Even if you look into\r\n!Generate_exe_bbfreeze.py you'll see extensive hacking of the output because BE is\r\nwritten in a particular *dynamic* way which prevents correct static analysis, so all\r\nthe standard ways of bundling it up fail to include most of BE and its dependencies.\r\n\r\nNiall Douglas\r\nFebruary 2012", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/downloads/ned14/Bugs-Everywhere-for-BEurtle/Bugs_Everywhere_BEurtle_fork_-1.5.0.1._2012_07_16_-py2.7.egg", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://bugseverywhere.org/", "keywords": "", "license": "GPL", "maintainer": "Niall Douglas", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "Bugs-Everywhere-BEurtle-fork", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Bugs-Everywhere-BEurtle-fork/", "platform": "All", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Bugs-Everywhere-BEurtle-fork/", "project_urls": {"Download": "https://github.com/downloads/ned14/Bugs-Everywhere-for-BEurtle/Bugs_Everywhere_BEurtle_fork_-1.5.0.1._2012_07_16_-py2.7.egg", "Homepage": "http://bugseverywhere.org/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Bugs-Everywhere-BEurtle-fork/1.5.0.1.-2012-07-16-/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Bugtracker supporting distributed revision control", "version": "1.5.0.1.-2012-07-16-", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>Bugs Everywhere (BEurtle fork)\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nForked by Niall Douglas <a href=\"http://www.nedprod.com/programs/Win32/BEurtle/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nedprod.com/programs/Win32/BEurtle/</a></p>\n<p>Herein is a fork by me from the master BE GIT repo at <a href=\"http://gitorious.org/be/be\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gitorious.org/be/be</a>.\nThe main change is that I have patched BE in various ways to make it work better on\nWindows.

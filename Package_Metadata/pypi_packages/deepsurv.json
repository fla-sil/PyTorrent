One medical application is provided, recommend_treatment, which provides treatment recommendations for a set of patient observations. \n\nInstallation:\n-------------\n\nDependencies:\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTheano, Lasagne, lifelines, matplotlib (for visualization) and all of their respective dependencies. \n\nInstalling:\n^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nYou can install *DeepSurv* using\n\n::\n\n\tpip install deepsurv\n\nfrom the command line.\n\nRunning the tests:\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAfter installing, you can optionally run the test suite with\n\n::\n\n\tpy.test\n\nfrom the command line while in the module main directory.\n\nTraining a Network:\n-------------------\n\nTraining DeepSurv can be done in a few lines. \nFirst, all you need to do is prepare the datasets to have the following keys:\n\n::\n\n\t{ \n\t\t'x': (n,d) observations (dtype = float32), \n\t \t't': (n) event times (dtype = float32),\n\t \t'e': (n) event indicators (dtype = int32)\n\t}\n\nThen prepare a dictionary of hyper-parameters. And it takes only two lines to train a network:\n\n::\n\n\tnetwork = deepsurv.DeepSurv(**hyperparams)\n\tlog = network.train(train_data, valid_data, n_epochs=500)\n\nYou can then evaluate its success on testing data:\n\n::\n\n\tnetwork.get_concordance_index(**test_data)\n\t>> 0.62269622730138632\n\nIf you have matplotlib installed, you can visualize the training and validation curves after training the network:\n\n::\n\n\tdeepsurv.plot_log(log)\n\n\n\nLicense:\n-------- \n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2016, Jared Katzman\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Currently, Pen is still in an early stage, but some\nnice additional features are planned. If you want to try Pen out now, don't be afraid!\nIf you run into any problems or bugs, please be sure to\n[create an issue](https://github.com/pspeter/pen/issues/new) describing your problem.\n\n*Windows is currently not supported. If you want to use Pen on Windows, you can leave a \nrequest for Windows support on the [the issue tracker](https://github.com/pspeter/pen/issues)\nor upvote an existing thread. Pen does work and is being tested on\n[the WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), though.*\n\n## Journaling\nWriting about your daily routine has been linked to therapeutic health benefits \nlike stress reduction\n[[1]](#1) [[2]](https://www.apa.org/monitor/jun02/writing).\nFor years, practitioners have used logs, questionnaires, journals and other\nwriting forms to help people heal from stresses and traumas.\nIt's not necessary to journal every single day, because it should not become a\nburden.\nHowever, when you feel like it would help get things off your mind, \nwhen you feel stressed by something or when you just want to go through an \nexperience in your head again before forgetting too many details, writing it\ndown can be a very relieving and helpful experience.\n\nPen is also great just as a simple note-keeping app. You could for example \ncreate a journal called 'code' where you briefly describe the cool new library \nyou learnt about today so you can go back to it later, or to describe how you \nsolved a difficult programming problem.  \n\nYou can also use Pen to track progress in your work, in the gym or \non the race track. Having a place to note your achievements, personal records \nor how much weight you lost over time is a great motivator, as you can\nalways look back and see how fast you progressed.\n\n\n## Installing Pen\n\nIt is recommend to install Pen using [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx):\n\n```pipx install pen```\n\nIf you don't want to use pipx, you can also use pip:\n\n```pip install --user pen```\n\nTo upgrade, either use `pipx upgrade pen` or `pip install --user --upgrade pen`\ndepending on how you installed Pen.\n\n\n## Using Pen\nTo write your first entry, just type `pen` into your command line and hit enter!\nIf you are transitioning from `jrnl`, you can instead import your old jrnls using\n`pen import /path/to/journals/*`.\nIf you haven't run Pen on this machine before, a short setup dialog will start, \nasking about your preferences like which editor you want to use. Pen will \nalways try to infer these settings from your environment variables and only ask\nwhen necessary. You can always change the way Pen behaves by changing its \nconfiguration which is by default located at `$HOME/.config/pen`. You can also\nchange the config file's location by exporting the `PEN_HOME` environment\nvariable before running `pen`. This is especially useful if you want to sync\nyour config using Dropbox, Google Cloud or a different cloud storage service.\n\n\n## (Planned) Features\n\nTo see all currently supported commands, type `pen --help`. To see more information\nabout a specific command type `pen <command> --help`. \n\nThe following list also gives a broad overview over the current features of Pen.\nImplemented features are marked with a \u2714. The list is ordered by their planned \nimplementation order, but the order may change at any time.\n\n\n| Feature | ? | Note |\n|---------|---|------|\n| Fully text based | \u2714 | |\n| Uses your OS settings when possible<br>(from environment variables) | \u2714 | $EDITOR, $VISUAL, $LC_TIME<br>and more!|\n| Multiple Journals | \u2714 | One can be set as default |\n| Writing/Deleting/Editing entries | \u2714 | |\n| Journals as single file | \u2714 |  |\n| Plugin System | \u2714\\* | (\\*still being extended)<br>based on [pluggy](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pluggy) |\n| Extendable Import System | \u2714 | supports imports from **jrnl** |\n| Filtering by date, tag, starred |  | |\n| Fast Search |  | |\n| Tags |  | |\n| Star entries (favourite) |  | |\n| git sync |  | Can use cloud<br>to sync (Dropbox, etc.) |\n| Journals as hierarchical directory |  |  |\n| Encryption |  | |\n| Custom Prompts |  | |\n| Store in custom file formats | \u2714 (1) | plugins can extend this!<br>currently implemented:<br> Markdown |\n| Imports from other sources |  | None planned<br>plugins possible|\n\n## References\n\n[1]: Smyth, Joshua M.

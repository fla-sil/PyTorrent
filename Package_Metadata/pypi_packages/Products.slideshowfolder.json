Slideshow 2 a powerful, feature-rich, easy-to-customize slideshow\nlibrary -- big thanks to Aeron Glemann all of the hard work he's poured\ninto it!\n\n.. _`Slideshow 2`: http://www.electricprism.com/aeron/slideshow\n\nSlideshow Folder offers the following features:\n\n * Animated slideshows with configurable transitions\n\n * Navigation thumbnails\n\n * Image captions\n\n * Intelligent preloading of images to save bandwidth\n\n * A play/pause/forward/reverse slideshow controller\n\n * Looping and random-order slideshows\n\n * Optional support for \"lightbox\" style image pop-ups\n\n * Look and feel completely customizable via CSS\n\nDesign Rationale\n====================\n\nSlideshow Folder uses Zope 3 development techniques to enable normal Plone Folders, Collections and Images with configurable slideshow views.\n\nWe wanted to develop a slideshow product for Plone that would avoid creating custom content types for the images and slideshow folders in order to allow easy installation, re-use of existing images in the site and to avoid \"stranding\" content in future upgrades or when you remove the product.\n\n\nDependencies \n====================\n\nSlideshow Folder is easiest to install and use under Plone 3.x, but also supports Plone 2.5.2+.  However, in order to use Slideshow Folder under Plone 2.5, you must be comfortable installing software from SVN checkout.\n\nSlideshow Folder requires:\n\n * Plone 3.0+ strongly recommended (Plone 2.5.2+ works, but requires the following dependences)\n\n * CMFonFive 1.3.4 (ONLY if using Plone 2.5.x - http://codespeak.net/z3/cmfonfive/)\n\n * Five 1.4 (ONLY if using Plone 2.5.x - http://codespeak.net/z3/five/)\n\n * plone.app.form (ONLY if using Plone 2.5.x - check out from http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.form/branches/plone-2.5\n\n\nInstallation \n====================\n\nPlone 3.x, buildout-based installer\n-----------------------------------\n\nIf you are using Plone 3.x via a buildout-based installer, simply add \"Products.slideshowfolder\"\nto the [eggs] section of your buildout.\n\n * Beginning with Plone 3.1, Plone's universal installer for Unix uses buildout.\n \n * Plone 3.2 and higher will use buildout for Windows, Mac OSX and Unix universal installers.\n\n\nPlone 3.0.x, non-buildout installer\n-----------------------------------\n\nSlideshow Folder installs in the conventional way.  Unzip the tarball and copy the product\nfolder \"slideshowfolder\" into your Zope Products directory and restart\nyour Zope instance.  You can then install it into your Plone site from the Plone Control\nPanel or the ZMI's portal_quickinstaller.  Uninstall it the\nsame way.\n\nPlone 2.5.x, non-buildout installer\n-------------------------------------\n\nDownload Slideshow Folder and its dependencies, listed above.\n\nInstall Slideshow Folder, CMFOnFive and Five in your Zope instance's Products folder as normal.\n\nplone.app.form must be checked out from SVN and installed in your Zope's instance's lib/python/plone/app/form directory.  It can be a bit tricky to unpack the directories correctly.  Tip: you get a directory called plone.app.form, but you need to go to your Zope instance's lib/python folder and do::\n\n  mkdir plone (if it doesn't exist)\n  cd plone\n  mkdir app (if it doesn't exist)\n  cd app\n  mkdir form\n\nThen go to your unpacked plone.app.form directory and do::\n\n  mv plone/app/form/*  yourzopeinstance/lib/python/plone/app/form\n\n\nPlone 2.5.x, buildout-based installation\n----------------------------------------\n\nAdd \"Products.slideshowfolder\" to the [eggs] section of your buildout.\n\nConsult buildout documentation for tips on installing CMFOnFive, Five tarballs \nand plone.app.form from SVN.  Warning: this will require some experience using\nbuildout for more complex installations.\n\n\nUsing Slideshow Folder\n======================\n\nEach Folder and Collection in your site will have a new option in its\n\"action\" menu -- \"make slideshow\". Choosing that will select a slideshow\nview for that folder and give you a new \"Slideshow Settings\"\nconfiguration tab.  As soon as there are published images in the folder,\nyou'll see the slideshow.  (Collections rely on the criteria that you\nput in them to render the images for the slideshow.  Non-images are\nignored.  That means that workflow restrictions are based solely on your\nCollection's criteria.)\n\nTo change the slideshow's settings, see the new \"slideshow settings\" tab\non the folder.\n\nEach image's Description will be used for its caption.  If there is no\ndescription, the Title will be used.\n\nEach slideshow will have an \"disable slideshow\" option in the action\nmenu.  This will revert it to being a normal Folder (or Smart Folder),\nincluding deleting the slideshow settings.  (It will not delete any\ncontent, though.)\n\nNote: The slideshow will only include published images in the folder.\nYou can customize this (rather crudely) by customizing\nfolder_slideshow.pt and calling the setWorkflowFilter method on the\nslideshow view.  (Options include \"None\" or any valid workflow state.)\nConsult the interfaces.py for documentation on those methods.\n(Alternatively, you can use a Collection and not place any workflow\nrestrictions on your criteria.)\n\nNote: Only a subset of the options for Aeron Glemann's library\nare supported via the 'Slideshow Settings' tab.  See\nhttp://code.google.com/p/slideshow/wiki/Slideshow\nfor the full list of options.  If customization beyond the options\nexposed via the web interface is needed, you can customize\nslideshow_settings.js.pt to specify the additional options.\n\nNote: You may use your own custom image content type as long as it\nimplements the Products.slideshowfolder.interfaces.ISlideshowImage\ninterface (which requires an Archetypes ImageField named 'image' in\nits schema.)  (Plone 3.0+ only.)\n\n\nLimitations\n===========\n\nSlideshow Folder currently has several limitations, most of which flow\nfrom the Slideshow 2 javascript class it is based on.\n\n * Transitions cannot be set on a per-slide basis, only for all the\n   slides in the slideshow.\n   \n * In IE, the slideshow does not operate properly when logged in as a\n   Manager and accessing the site at http://localhost/.  You can work\n   around this by using http://127.0.0.1/ instead.  See\n   http://plone.org/products/slideshowfolder/issues/46 for details.\n\n\nCredits \n=======\n\nSlideshow Folder was written by `Johnpaul Burbank`_, with subsequent\nchanges by `Jon Baldivieso`_.

Also removed detail\n  about publishing, since images are no longer associated with a workflow by default.\n  [jessesnyder]\n\n4.0 - release candidate 2 (2008-07-18)\n--------------------------------------\n\n- Worked around an obscure Javascript error affecting IE when logged in.\n  [davisagli]\n\n- Applied patch for http://code.google.com/p/slideshow/issues/detail?id=28&can=1\n  from upstream, which fixes an issue where images weren't displayed when serving\n  via a proxy.\n  [davisagli]\n\n4.0 - release candidate 1 (2008-07-11)\n--------------------------------------\n\n- Added \"Slideshowfolder: Manage slideshow settings\" permission\n  (assigned to Manager, Editor, and Owner roles by default.)\n  [davisagli]\n\n- Added i18n infrastructure.\n  [davisagli]\n\n- Improved compatibility with things that are not ATImages but implement the same interface\n  (ISlideshowImage).\n  [davisagli]\n\n- Switched settings form to use formlib.\n  [davisagli]\n\n- Modified mootools 'protect' flag to work around still-present conflict with kupuhelpers.js\n  [davisagli]\n\n- Switched to \"Slideshow 2\" javascript and Mootools 1.2.\n  Changes to templates, settings to expose new features.\n  [jonstahl]\n\n\n3.0 alpha 2 - unreleased\n------------------------\n\n- Using proper noLongerProvides zope.interface API for removing a marker interface from content object\n  [andrewb]\n\n- Removing testJSRegisteryHasResources per no longer present mootools.js, slideshow.js in JS registry.\n  This is now pulled in via a metal slot (see below for more)\n  [andrewb]\n\n- Load javascript via a metal slot rather than via the javascript registry, to avoid conflicting with kupu.\n  [davisagli]\n\n\n3.0 alpha 1 - 2007.12.11\n------------------------\n\n- Moved registration of \"slideshow settings\" action to Generic Setup; it gets re-registered in Plone 3.0 to \n  a different action id via a separate profile.\n\n\n1.2.2 - 2007.12.11\n------------------\n\n- Fixed conditional zope.annotations import in a more graceful way.\n  [FinnArild]\n\n- Removed newlines from image descriptions; they were breaking the js.  Thanks to \"Taun\" for finding this.\n  [jbaldivieso]\n\n- Fixed another js bug caused by a misplaced comma.\n  [jbaldivieso]\n  \n\n1.2.1 - 2007.10.29\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a minor bug where duration settings were not getting respected due to malformed JS.\n  [jbaldivieso]\n\n\n1.2 - 2007.10.22\n----------------\n\n- Finished support for Smart Folders -- slideshows now show up properly for them. (Rich Topics\n  are supported.) (issue #14)\n  [jbaldivieso]\n\n- Fixed the slideshow settings javascript so that it works in IE.\n  [jbaldivieso]\n\n- cleaned up the Generic Setup install steps.  (No bugs were reported, but installation could have\n  been a little funny before.)\n  [jbaldivieso]\n\n- Slideshows now use full absolute urls for image sources. This should mean that spaces in image\n  names are escaped properly.  (issue #15)\n  [jbaldivieso]\n  \n\n1.1 - 2007.10.04\n----------------\n\n- Restructured how the slideshow settings are delivered to the template. Separated out\n  the data from the presentation (no more HTML/JS coming directly from the browser view).\n  In so doing:\n  \n  - gave support for Unicode image captions (issue #8)\n  - gave skin-level support for filtering slideshow image content based on WF (i.e.,\n    showing non-published images in a slideshow is a template change now)\n  \n  [jbaldivieso]\n \n- Modified the slideshow template to give feedback when the folder didn't have content\n  for a slideshow (including a message of advice if you are a content editor).  (issue #7)\n  [jbaldivieso]\n\n- Uninstall process examines all folders in the catalog and unslideshowifies them (as\n  long as you're not reinstalling) (issue #9). Uninstall also removes its traces from\n  portal_actions.\n  [jbaldivieso]\n\n- Refactored the way slideshows are activated. One switch does it all (including changing\n  the view template). All folders may now be activated, regardless of whether they have\n  images in them yet. Slideshows may also now be deactivated.\n  [jbaldivieso]\n\n- Use backgroundColor from base_properties for slideshow bg color (issue #3).\n  [jbaldivieso]\n\n\n1.0 - 2007.09.??\n----------------\n\n- First release.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://plone.org/products/slideshowfolder", "keywords": "plone slideshow album mootools javascript", "license": "GPL", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "Products.slideshowfolder", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Products.slideshowfolder/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Products.slideshowfolder/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://plone.org/products/slideshowfolder"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Products.slideshowfolder/4.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Slideshow Folder provides a simple, elegant animated slideshow for Plone.", "version": "4.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"about\">\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>Slideshow Folder provides a simple, elegant animated slideshow for\nPlone.</p>\n<p>Slideshow Folder integrates the <cite>Slideshow 2</cite> javascript class into\nPlone.

This should mean that spaces in image\nnames are escaped properly.  (issue #15)\n[jbaldivieso]</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"id4\">\n<h3>1.1 - 2007.10.04</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Restructured how the slideshow settings are delivered to the template. Separated out\nthe data from the presentation (no more HTML/JS coming directly from the browser view).\nIn so doing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>gave support for Unicode image captions (issue #8)</li>\n<li>gave skin-level support for filtering slideshow image content based on WF (i.e.,\nshowing non-published images in a slideshow is a template change now)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[jbaldivieso]</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Modified the slideshow template to give feedback when the folder didn\u2019t have content\nfor a slideshow (including a message of advice if you are a content editor).  (issue #7)\n[jbaldivieso]</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Uninstall process examines all folders in the catalog and unslideshowifies them (as\nlong as you\u2019re not reinstalling) (issue #9). Uninstall also removes its traces from\nportal_actions.\n[jbaldivieso]</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Refactored the way slideshows are activated. One switch does it all (including changing\nthe view template). All folders may now be activated, regardless of whether they have\nimages in them yet. Slideshows may also now be deactivated.\n[jbaldivieso]</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Use backgroundColor from base_properties for slideshow bg color (issue #3).\n[jbaldivieso]</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div

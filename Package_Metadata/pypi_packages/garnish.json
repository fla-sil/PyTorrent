Omitting a license from your open source project limits its usefulness to the community.\n\nThis project aims to reduce the \"pain\" of applying boilerplate licensing to your\nopen source projects.\n\n### Install\n\nFor python devs, installing the latest release of garnish is as simple as \n\n    $ pip install garnish\n\nIf you're not a frequent python user and don't have the `pip` installer, you can also install it manually \n\n    $ git clone git://github.com/jhamon/garnish.git\n    $ cd garnish\n    $ python setup.py install\n\n### Quickstart \n\nTo see the full menu of available options and licenses, run `garnish -h` or\n`garnish --help` at any time. \n\nTo get started nagivate to your project root, and use the following syntax on the command line\n\n    $ garnish <license> \"Cool Copyright Hold\" \"Your Awesome Project Name\" \n\nA few examples of basic usage might be:\n\n    $ garnish gpl3 \"GNU Foundation\" \"Emacs\" \n    $ garnish mit \"Google, Inc\" \"Angular JS\"\n\nGarnish supports many popular and interesting licenses.\n\n    Popular:\n            artistic  Perl Foudation Artistic License, Version 2.0\n            agpl3     GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3.0\n            apache2   Apache License, Version 2.0\n            bsd3      BSD 3-Clause License\n            bsd2      BSD 2-Clause License\n            gpl2      GNU General Public License, Version 2.0\n            gpl3      GNU General Public License, Version 3.0\n            lgpl3     GNU Lesser General Public License,Version 3.0\n            mit       MIT License\n            mpl2      Mozilla Public License, Version 2.0\n    Other:\n            crapl       Community Research and Academic Programming License\n            unlicense   Release code to public domain.

When the terms of a license recommend or require a copyright and\nlicensing notice to be placed inside a file, garnish will do this automatically\nunless you prevent it using the `-x` option.  You can force the use of source\nfile headers regardless of license used with the with the `-f` option.\n\nIf you find yourself needing to remove the licensing notice garnish has placed\ninside your project's source files (e.g. because you want to change to a\ndifferent license), run the `garnish-rm` (no space) command in your project\nroot. This command inspects each file and looks for the license block delimeters\nthat garnish normally applies (e.g. the `::::: LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT NOTICE ::::` \nand `::::::::::::::::::::::::::` lines).  `garnish-rm` will do nothing to your\nfile if the notice delimeters are missing or modified.\n\n### License\n\nGarnish is Copyright (c) 2013 Jennifer Hamon (jen@hamon.io) and released under\nthe MIT license.

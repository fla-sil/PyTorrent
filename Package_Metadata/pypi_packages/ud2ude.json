[**Converter:**](#Converter) (The current project,) Universal-Dependencies to enhancedUD converter, aimed to port core-nlp's Java converter to a python(3.6) converter, embedded with my researched add-ins (\"extra or Aryeh's enhancements\").\n2. [**Model:**](https://github.com/allenai/ud_spacy_model) spaCy trained model based on UD (and PENN converted to UD) dataset.\n3. [**Demo:**](https://github.com/aryehgigi/ud2ude_demo) {will be move to public when stable} JS and python code, making use of the converter. Simply check it out [here](http://nlp.biu.ac.il/~aryeht/eud/)\n\n<a name=\"Converter\"/>\n\n## Converter\nThe converter converts UD (v1.4) to enhancedUD, enhancedUD++, and extra-enhancements (discovered as part of my thesis).\nIt supports Conll-U and Odin formats (and some conversions between them).\n\nGenerally, I tried to maintain the same behavior (mentioned [here](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2016/pdf/779_Paper.pdf), and that was implemented by [core-NLP java converter](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-dependencies.shtml)) as much as reasonable.\n\nThe converter coveres the following conversions:\n\n|                                                                                 | [paper](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/schuster2016enhanced.pdf)   (or [here](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2016/pdf/779_Paper.pdf)) | [UD formal guidelines   (v2)](https://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/enhanced-syntax.html)          | coreNLP   code  | Converter       | notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| nmod/acl/advcl   case info                                                          | eUD                                                                                                                                            | eUD   (under 'obl' for v2)                                                                                | eUD             | eUD             | 1.

Modifiers that appear after both parts of the conjunction may (the ratio   should be researched) refer to both parts. Moreover, If the modifiers father   is not the immediate conjunction part, then all the conjunction parts between   the father and the modifier are (most probably) modified by the   modifier.<br>2. If the modifier father is the immediate conjunction part, we propagate   the modifier backward only if the new father, doesn't have any modifiers sons   (this is to restrict a bit the amount of false-positives).<br>3. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t propagate modifier forwardly (that is, if the conjunct part   appears after the modifier, we assume they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t refer).<br>4.

Install it.\n#. In your personal preferences, set your editor to MarkItUp.\n   You can also set it as the default editor in Site Setup \u2192 Editing.\n   If we edit HTML we get a fallback to TinyMCE editor. So we can just set\n   MarkItUp as default and edit everythink we want with the proper editor.\n#. Make sure any markup language you want users to be able to use are checked\n   in Site Setup \u2192 Markup. By now only text/x-web-markdown and text/restructured.\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\nThe code is in collective repository on github:\nhttps://github.com/collective/collective.markitup\n\n\nAuthors\n-------\n* Michael A.

Not ideal, but at least now\n   the image button actually works.\n   [msmith64]\n\n - Got the plonefinder to show images.

MarkUpSet directories have to be named after\n   the subtype (secondhalf of the mimetype).\n   [msmith64]\n\n - Improved preview styles by adding <div id=\"content\"/> around the\n   content to be previewed.\n   [msmith64]\n\n - Improved preview styles even more so that they don't need HTTP requests.\n   Now the only crappiness is the amount of Javascript needed to get it done.\n   [msmith64]\n\n - Improved preview styles so loading them isn't quite as crappy.\n   Still crappy though\n - Some cleanup/whitespace pedantry\n   [msmith64]\n\n - Depends on collective.plonefinder\n   [msmith64]\n\n - Added a somewhat crappy way to apply the page styles to the preview.\n   It's crappy, but it's faster that causing Plone to load a full-template\n   page.\n   [msmith64]\n\n - Used portal_url defined in plone_javascript_variables.js to find root path\n   to objects.\n   [msmith64]\n \n - Removed unneeded template.\n - Previewer can pick between reStructuredText, Markdown, Textile,\n   (and HTML, which is a no-op).\n - Auto-loads based on chosen content-type.\n - Needed resources load on-the-fly, so very little needs to be in the Plone\n   registries.\n - Added plugins for Textile and Rest as well as more robust HTML.\n - Simple, unobtrusive default look.\n   [msmith64]\n\n - Added proof-of-concept AJAX preview view of Markdown transform.\n   [msmith64]\n\n - Tweaked GS profile so that user preferences are respected.\n   TinyMCE, I'm talking to you.\n   [msmith64]\n\n - Added MarkItUp JQuery plugin and registered resources in basic GS profile.\n   [msmith64]\n\n - Added MarkItUp to available editors in control panel.\n   [msmith64]\n\n - Initial setup\n   [msmith64]", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://smith-li.com", "keywords": "web zope plone editor", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "collective.markitup", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/collective.markitup/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/collective.markitup/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://smith-li.com"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/collective.markitup/0.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "collective.markitup integrates MarkItUp with Plone", "version": "0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"introduction\">\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>This product integrates the MarkItUp editor with Plone.

If using memory you are limited by the available memory, swapping will occur for very large files.\n* Neither permissions or timestamps are supported by B2. B2_fuse ignores any requests to set permissions.\n* Filesystem contains \".sha1\" files, these are undeletable and contain the hash of the file without the postfix. This feature can be disabled by setting variable \"enable_hashfiles\" to False.\n* For optimal performance and throughput, you should store a few large files. Small files suffer from latency issues due to the way B2 API is implemented. Large files will allow you to saturate your internet connection.\n\n### Application specific notes:\n\n#### Using RSync with B2 Fuse\n\nSince there is no support for updating file times or permissions in a bucket, rsync must be told to ignore both when synching folders (sync will be based on checksum meaning files have to be downloaded to compare).\n\n```\nrsync -avzh --no-perms --no-owner --no-group dir1/ dir2/ \n```\n\nOption \"--inplace\" may also be useful. RSync creates a temporary file when syncing, this option will make RSync update the file inplace instead (Effectively twice as fast syncing).\n\n#### Using unison to synchronize against mounted folder\n\nAgain, we ignore permissions as these are not applicable.\n\n```\nunison dir1/ dir2/ -auto  -perms 0  -batch\n```\n\n#### Using encfs to overlay a locally encrypted filesystem onto the bucket\n\nInstall encfs (apt-get install encfs)\n\n```\nencfs <bucket_mountpoint> <encrypted_filesystem>\n```\n\n#### Instruction for permanent mounting of B2Fuse can be found [here](../master/permanent_mount.md)\n\n### Known issues:\n\n* Concurrent access from multiple client will lead to inconsistent results\n* Small files give low read/write performance (due to high latency)\n* Some text editors may return odd characters when viewing the \".sha1\" files. Use cat for reliable operation.\n\n\nLicense: MIT license", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "b2fuse", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/b2fuse/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/b2fuse/", "project_urls": null, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/b2fuse/1.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "FUSE integration for Backblaze B2 Cloud storage", "version": "1.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            # b2_fuse - FUSE for Backblaze B2<br> <br>### Version: 1.3 <br><br>#### This is fresh release based upon B2 Command line tool's API for B2. <br><br>#### Warning this software may contain bugs, be careful of using it with important data.<br>#### Please report bugs, use-case issues and feature requests through the Github issue tracker<br><br><br><br>### Basic setup:<br><br>Requires YAML and FUSE for python to work (this is not the same as \"python-fuse\" package). <br><br>Install YAML for python as follows: <br><br>```<br>sudo apt-get install python-yaml<br>```<br><br>Install FUSE and B2 Command Line Tool for python as follows: <br><br>```<br>sudo apt-get install python-pip<br>sudo pip install fusepy<br>sudo pip install b2<br>```<br><br>If the above does not work (a possibility on Python 2.7) use this instead:<br><br>```<br>sudo python -m pip install fusepy<br>sudo python -m pip install b2<br>```<br><br>An example config (\"config.yaml\"):<br><br>```<br>accountId: &lt;youraccountid&gt;<br>applicationKey: &lt;yourapplicationid&gt;<br>bucketId: &lt;yourbucketid&gt;<br>```<br><br>In order to use the FUSE driver as an interface to the online service B2 run:<br><br>```<br>python b2fuse.py &lt;mountpoint&gt;<br>```<br><br>Full usage info:<br><br><br>```<br>usage: b2fuse.py [-h] [--enable_hashfiles] [--version] [--use_disk]<br>                 [--account_id ACCOUNT_ID] [--application_key APPLICATION_KEY]<br>                 [--bucket_id BUCKET_ID] [--temp_folder TEMP_FOLDER]<br>                 [--config_filename CONFIG_FILENAME]<br>                 mountpoint<br><br>positional arguments:<br>  mountpoint            Mountpoint for the B2 bucket<br><br>optional arguments:<br>  -h, --help            show this help message and exit<br>  --enable_hashfiles    Enable normally hidden hashes as exposed by B2 API<br>  --version             show program's version number and exit<br>  --use_disk<br>  --account_id ACCOUNT_ID<br>                        Account ID for your B2 account (overrides config)<br>  --application_key APPLICATION_KEY<br>                        Application key for your account (overrides config)<br>  --bucket_id BUCKET_ID<br>                        Bucket ID for the bucket to mount (overrides config)<br>  --temp_folder TEMP_FOLDER<br>                        Temporary file folder<br>  --config_filename CONFIG_FILENAME<br>                        Config file<br>```<br><br>Usage notes:<br><br>* Can be used as a regular filesystem, but should not (high latency)<br>* Files are cached in memory or on disk.

Unzip the tar.gz somewhere.\n\n    2.  In a console window navigate to the DangerUXB-1.1 directory and run the\n        following command as root (on Ubuntu/Debian use sudo):\n\n            ``[sudo] python3 setup.py install``\n\n    3.  On Ubuntu a desktop launcher is installed, which you should be able to\n        find in the Dash and drag to the launcher bar.\n\nDesign Notes and Plans\n======================\n\nThe implementation here is in tkinter/ttk. The only major drawback to this that\nI am aware of (at the moment) is that the gifs on the buttons cannot be made to\nre-size nicely without help from some other package (most likely PIL). To keep \nnon-core packages to a minimum (i.e., zero) I have opted for the more kludgy \nway, having different sizes of the gif files to load in according to the screen \nsize. The impact here is mostly on memory footprint, especially if you keep \nre-sizing the window, as the images are cached in memory.\n\nAuthor:\n=======\n\nBob Bowles <bobjohnbowles@gmail.com>", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/DangerUXB/1.1", "keywords": "Mines", "license": "GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "DangerUXB", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/DangerUXB/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/DangerUXB/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/DangerUXB/1.1"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/DangerUXB/1.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A version of the Mines game intended for casual play.", "version": "1.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>An implementation of the well-known \u2018Mines\u2019 game in pure Python (using the\nnative tkinter/ttk graphics and nothing else).

Strings can be converted to LatLon objects using the method string2latlon, and to Latitude or Longitude objects using string2geocoord. Alternatively, a LatLon object can be constructed by subtracting two LatLon objects, or adding or subtracting a Latlon object and a GeoVector object.\n\n##### Latitude or Longitude Construction\nLatitude of longitude construction is through the classes Latitude and Longitude, respectively. You can pass a latitude or longitude coordinate in any combination of decimal degrees, degrees and minutes, or degrees minutes and seconds. Alternatively, you can pass a formatted string using the function string2geocoord for a string containing a single latitude or longitude, or string2latlon for a pair of strings representing the latitude and longitude.\n\n##### String formatting:\nstring2latlon and string2geocoord both take a formatter string which is loosely modeled on the format keyword used in datetime\u2019s strftime function. Indicator characters (e.g. H or D) are placed between a specific separator character (%) to specify the way in which a coordinate string is formatted. Possible values are as follows:\n\n> * H is a hemisphere identifier (e.g. N, S, E or W)\n> * D is a coordinate in decimal degrees notation (e.g. 5.833)\n> * d is a coordinate in degrees notation (e.g. 5)\n> * M is a coordinate in decimal minutes notation (e.g. 54.35)\n> * m is a coordinate in minutes notation (e.g. 54)\n> * S is a coordinate in seconds notation (e.g. 28.93)\n> * Any other characters (e.g. \u2018 \u2018 or \u2018, \u2018) will be treated as a separator between the above components.\n> * All components should be separated by the % character. For example, if the coord_str is \u20185, 52, 59.88_N\u2019, the format_str would be \u2018d%, %m%, %S%_%H\u2019\n\n##### Important\nOne format that will not currently work is one where the hemisphere identifier and a degree or decimal degree are not separated by any characters. For example \u20185 52 59.88 N\u2019 is valid whereas \u20185 52 59.88N\u2019 is not.\n\n##### String output:\nBoth LatLon and Latitude and Longitude objects include a to_string() method for outputting a formatted coordinate.\n\n##### Projection:\nUse LatLon.project to transform geographical coordinates into a chosen projection. Requires that you pass it a pyproj or basemap projection.\n\n##### Distance and Heading Calculation:\nLatLon objects have a distance() method which accepts a 2nd LatLon object as an argument. distance() will calculate the great-circle distance between the two coordinates using the WGS84 ellipsoid by default. To use the more approximate FAI sphere, set ellipse to \u2018sphere\u2019. Initial and reverse headings (in degrees) can be calculated in a similar way using the heading_initial() and heading_reverse() methods. Alternatively, subtracting one LatLon object from another will return a GeoVector object with the attributes heading and distance.\n\n##### Creating a New LatLon Object by Offset from Another One:\nUse the offset() method of LatLon objects, which takes an initial heading (in degrees) and distance (in km) to return a new LatLon object at the offset coordinates. Also, you can perform the same operation by adding or subtracting a LatLon object with a GeoVector object.\n\n#### Examples\nCreate a LatLon object from coordinates:\n\n```python\n>> palmyra = LatLon(Latitude(5.8833), Longitude(-162.0833)) # Location of Palmyra Atoll in decimal degrees\n>> palmyra = LatLon(5.8833, -162.0833) # Same thing but simpler!\n>> palmyra = LatLon(Latitude(degree = 5, minute = 52, second = 59.88),\n>>                  Longitude(degree = -162, minute = -4.998) # or more complicated!\n>> print(palmyra.to_string('d% %m% %S% %H')) # Print coordinates to degree minute second\n('5 52 59.88 N', '162 4 59.88 W')\n```\n\nCreate a Latlon object from a formatted string:\n\n```python\n>> palmyra = string2latlon('5 52 59.88 N', '162 4 59.88 W', 'd% %m% %S% %H')\n>> print(palmyra.to_string('d%_%M')) # Print coordinates as degree minutes separated by underscore\n('5_52.998', '-162_4.998')\n```\n\nPerform some calculations:\n\n```python\n>> palmyra = LatLon(Latitude(5.8833), Longitude(-162.0833)) # Location of Palmyra Atoll\n>> honolulu = LatLon(Latitude(21.3), Longitude(-157.8167)) # Location of Honolulu, HI\n>> distance = palmyra.distance(honolulu) # WGS84 distance in km\n>> print distance\n1766.69130376\n>> print(palmyra.distance(honolulu, ellipse = 'sphere')) # FAI distance in km\n1774.77188181\n>> initial_heading = palmyra.heading_initial(honolulu) # Heading from Palmyra to Honolulu on WGS84 ellipsoid\n>> print(initial_heading)\n14.6907922022\n>> hnl = palmyra.offset(initial_heading, distance) # Reconstruct Honolulu based on offset from Palmyra\n>> print(hnl.to_string('D')) # Coordinates of Honolulu\n('21.3', '-157.8167')\n```\n\nManipulate LatLon objects using GeoVectors:\n\n```python\n>> vector = (honolulu - palmyra) * 2 # A GeoVector with 2x the magnitude of a vector from palmyra to honolulu\n>> print(vector) # Print heading and magnitude\n14.6907922022 3533.38260751\nprint(palmyra + (vector/2.0)) # Recreate the coordinates of Honolulu by adding half of vector to palmyra\n21.3, -157.8167\n```\n\n#### Version\n1.0.2 - Tested on Python 2.7 with Eclipse IDLE.

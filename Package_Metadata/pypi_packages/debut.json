That's a portmanteau of DEBian and UTilities!\n\n\nOrigin\n------\n\nThis library is based on a heavily modified and remixed combo of original code\nwith code from several other origins:\n\n* python-deb-pkg-tools from @xolox for its handling of Debian packages and the\n  parsing of dependencies and other package-to-package relationship fields.\n  See https://github.com/xolox/python-deb-pkg-tools\n\n* dlt (Debian license tools) from @agustinhenze for its check of the\n  coverage of a license file Files sections and a lot of inspiration.\n  See https://github.com/agustinhenze/dlt/\n\n* PGPy from @SecurityInnovation and @Commod0re for its ability to remove a PGP\n  signature from an email. dsc (Debian Source Control) files are typically\n  PGP-signed.\n  See https://github.com/SecurityInnovation/PGPy\n\n* python-dpkg by @TheClimateCorporation and @memory for its ability to process\n  the syntax of Debian versions and to compare them according to the spec.\n  See https://github.com/TheClimateCorporation/python-dpkg\n\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nWhy create this seemingly redundant library? The official python-debian tools\nand several other utilities already provide similar capabilities!\n\nOn the surface this is correct, but there are several differences and reasons\nlisted here:\n\n* Existing tools are parsing control files rather strictly. This library tries\n  to be more flexible. For instance it can recognize and fix some almost\n  correct copyright files that are not fully \"machine readable\" but close\n  enough to the spec to be worthy of recovery.\n\n* Several of these tools have to deal with a lot of legacy compatibility. We\n  do not have such need. For instance, the Python standard library email module\n  and one line of code is enough to parse a Debian 822 file fields. I doubt\n  thatthis feature was available in the standard library when python-debian was\n  started but it is here now and this vastly simplifies the code.\n\n* This library focus is to parse and inspect control files and much less so to\n  emit and create them, so the code and tests can be much simpler. For instance,\n  rather than using somewhat more complex case-insensitive dictionary keys while\n  preserving case for Deb822-like objects, this library uses lower case keys\n  throughout.\n\n* The official python-debian library is GPL-licensed making it it hard to\n  combine with Apache-licensed libraries. I went through efforts to\n  work out a relicensing of python-debian with all its authors such that it\n  could be integrated in permissive-licensed Python tools. Even though most\n  current maintainers and contributors were OK with that relicensing to a\n  permissive or an LGPL license, I could not get a reply and agreement from\n  some important legacy authors: therefore the relicensing could not happen.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 AND BSD-3-Clause AND MIT\n\nThis software combines several origins each with their own license.\nAll these licenses apply as all original files have been refactored and remixed\nsignificantly::\n\n    Copyright nexB Inc. and others.\n    Copyright (c) 2018 Peter Odding.\n    Copyright 2017 The Climate Corporation (https://climate.com)\n    Copyright (c) 2014-2019 Security Innovation, Inc\n    Copyright 2013 Agustin Henze <tin@sluc.org.ar>\n\nNote that the tests/ may also contain files using other FOSS licenses.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/nexB/debut", "keywords": "debian,deb822,copyright,package,dependency,license,licensing,dep5,control,dsc,python-debian,dpkg,libapt", "license": "Apache-2.0 AND BSD-3-Clause AND MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "debut", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/debut/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/debut/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/nexB/debut"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/debut/0.9.4/", "requires_dist": ["chardet (<4.0.0,>=3.0.0)", "attrs (>=19.2)"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Utilities to parse Debian package, copyright and control files.", "version": "0.9.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>The Python package <cite>debut</cite> is a collection of utilities to parse various Debian\npackage manifests, machine readable copyright and control files collectively\nknown as the Debian 822 format (based on the RFC822 email format).</p>\n<p>Why the name <cite>debut</cite>?

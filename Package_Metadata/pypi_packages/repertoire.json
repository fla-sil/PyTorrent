Life, whatever it may be!\n```\n\n## People\nThe *people* binder tests you on topics of interest and important contributions of major figures in your field, as well as (optionally) their birth and/or death years.\nIt is organized by person:\n```yaml\nbinder: people\nsheets:\n- name: Bill Thurston\n  dates: 1946-2012\n  topics: low-dimensional topology; foliation; geometrization conjecture\n- name: Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer\n  dates: 1881-1966\n  topics: fixed point theorem; intuitionism\n```\n\n## Math\nThe *math* binder is relatively open-ended, but can test you on definitions, theorem statements, proof key ideas, etc.\nIts key feature is support for latex rendering in iTerm2:\n```yaml\nbinder: math\nsheets:\n- name: Strong law of large numbers\n  statement: |\n    $\\bar{X}_n \\overset{a.s.}{\\to} \\mu$\n- name: Weak law of large numbers\n  statement: |\n    $\\lim_n \\mathbb{P}[|\\bar{X}_n - \\mu| < \\epsilon] = 0$\n- name: Heine\u2013Cantor theorem\n  statement: |\n    If $f : M \\to N$ is a continuous function on a compact metric space $M$, then $f$ is uniformly continuous\n  proof: |\n    Find a finite subcover of the balls of half the radius needed to make $f$ change by no more than $\\epsilon$, and take $\\delta$ as their minimum radius.\n```\n\n# Installation\n1. Install repertoire with `pip install repertoire`\n1. If you want to use the math binder, make sure you have LaTeX installed (and use iTerm2), as well as ImageMagick (`brew install imagemagick` on MacOS)\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/agajews/repertoire", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "repertoire", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/repertoire/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/repertoire/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/agajews/repertoire"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/repertoire/0.0.2/", "requires_dist": ["blessings", "click", "getkey"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Spaced repetition in plain text", "version": "0.0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Repertoire</h1>\n<p>Spaced repetition is a technique that <a href=\"http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">some people</a> like to use to remember things.\nIn particular, things they would like to remember over many years, perhaps for the rest of their lives.\n<a href=\"https://apps.ankiweb.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anki</a> is a popular program for doing this, but it seems unlikely that it will still be possible to run this program 10 years from now (its UI is already showing its age).</p>\n<p>Repertoire is a minimalistic, extensible program for spaced repetition.\nMemories are stored in plain text (which, in my view, will never become obsolete), and the testing interface can run in nothing more than a text-based console.</p>\n<h1>Binders</h1>\n<p>There are three built-in <em>binders</em>, formats for flashcards (<em>sheets</em> in the musical analogy): quotes, people, and math.</p>\n<h2>Quotes</h2>\n<p>Quotes ask you to identify your favorite quotations, their authors, and the dates when they were published.\nThe file is organized by work, decreasing overhead when you have multiple quotes from the same work:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"nt\">binder</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain\">quotes</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">sheets</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n<span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span> <span class=\"nt\">title</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain\">Discourse on Method</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">author</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain\">Ren\u00e9 Descartes</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">date</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain\">1637</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">quotes</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span> <span class=\"nt\">quote</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain\">I think therefore I am</span>\n  <span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span> <span class=\"nt\">quote</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain\">Good sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed</span>\n<span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span> <span class=\"nt\">title</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain\">Crime and Punishment</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">author</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain\">Fyodor Dostoevsky</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">date</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain\">1866</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">quotes</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"p p-Indicator\">-</span> <span class=\"nt\">quote</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain\">Only to live, to live and live!

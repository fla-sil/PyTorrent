One of\nthe key practices of agile development, is prioritizing the backlog.  That\ncan be difficult to do in Trac, as it doesn't have any way of doing\nfine-grained ranking of tickets.  This plugin helps resolve that\nshort-coming.\n\nTracBacklog adds a new navigational element to your navigation bar.\nClicking on it will take you to the unscheduled backlog (all active tickets\nthat aren't currently assigned to a milestone).  On the right hand side,\nis a listing of open milestones.  The idea is that you drag-n-drop tickets\nwithin the list itself to change their rank.  Once you're happy with the\nranking (i.e., you've worked with your customer to prioritize the outstanding\ntickets), you drag-n-drop tickets onto a milestone to assign it into the\nmilestone.  This effectively treats milestones as sprints, which works well\nfor us... and I hope it works well for you!\n\nThe unscheduled backlog is created from tickets that are not assigned\nto any milestone.  You can also view each milestone and see and individual\nbacklog for it, but all tickets are ranked absolutely (they maintain their\nabsolute ranking when you drag them in and out of a milestone).  Furthermore,\nif you are trying this on an existing project, the initial rank for each\nticket will be it's ticket id.  You'll want to spend some time sorting your\ntickets, and you may want to consider pulling them all into the unscheduled\nbacklog when you do that (so that you can order the all the tickets against\neach other).\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nIt requires simplejson 2.0 or better, and Trac 0.11 or better.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nUsing ``easy_install``::\n\n    $ easy_install -U TracBacklog\n\nFrom a tarball::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\nEnable the plugin in trac.ini::\n\n    [components]\n    backlog.* = enabled\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nUsers can customize the fields they see in the Backlog preference pane.\n\nAlso, you will need to run ``trac-admin upgrade`` on your database, since the\nplugin needs to create a table and some default values for your tickets.\n\n\nBugs/Feature Requests\n---------------------\n\nPlease use the\n`GitHub site <https://github.com/jszakmeister/trac-backlog/issues>`_ to file any\nbug and feature requests.\n\n\nSource\n------\n\nThe plugin is maintained on\n`GitHub <https://github.com/jszakmeister/trac-backlog>`_.\n\n\nOther Solutions\n---------------\n\nA Trac plug-in to help folks use Trac to maintain their backlog when using an\nagile development methodology.

Well, there are a few issues with a lot of the\nAPIs readily available online:\n1. A lot of the APIs are out of date. Both Yahoo and Google have stepped back from\nproviding APIs for finance data during the last couple of years and a lot of the\nexisting project - especially on GitHub - were created before that happened and never\nmaintained properly afterwards.\n2. Those data sources that do work properly, often only provide access to a few\nselect markets, most of the time the American stock market. This obviously might\nrestrict your application, especially if you are planning to cater to an international\naudience.\n3. Another issue with commercially maintained APIs often comes with the usage. The free\naccess usually harshly restricts usage by limiting the quotes per minute or per day.\nIf you ever plan to provide your app to the general public, or just a couple of\nfriends, this could put you in a difficult situation of choosing between a free plan\nor a generally usable program.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of things other APIs can do better than this one. This is\nwhy I do want to also tell you when **not** to use this API:\n* You only need data from a **single market**. There are probably a bunch of APIs \nspecializing in data from the market you are looking at. Take a look at those before \njumping into FinanceScraper.\n* You want to write a little application for your **personal use only**. In this case\nthe free plans of commercially available APIs are probably enough for you. Maybe take\na look at [WorldTradingData](https://www.worldtradingdata.com/).\n* You need a lot of data very fast and have no means of parallel execution. In this \ncase you will probably want to use one of the well established APIs, as this project\nis doing full HTML requests to ensure the most recent quotes possible. If you however\nhave a lot of rapid requests on the same data you may want to check out this\nprojects data caching/buffering capabilities.\n\n## Project setup\n\nIf you simply want to use the API, I recommend using the latest stable version \nwhich can be acquired by running `` pip install FinanceScraper ``. For the API's\nusage take a look at the documentation. (I swear it will come soon, this is still\nin it's very beginning)\n\nIf you are looking to contribute to this project please go ahead! You're going to have\nto fork the project and do your work in your own repository. If you are seeing anything\nthat could/should be improved please put in an issue and I will assign you if you want\nto solve it yourself. In order to get your progress into this main project you just have\nto put in a pull request for a branch up-to-date with the current master.\n\n## ToDo\nNow I also want to tell you about what I am planning to add to this project for the\nnext major, minor and micro versions.\n\n### Micro\ncurrently no clear goals for the next micro version\n\n### Minor\n* [ ] introduce more data sources\n* [x] provide a class that forwards a request to multiple different scraper objects\nand collects the result, returning the first returned result or None\n\n### Major\n* look into performance improvements\n* as this will be 1.x.x should be well documented and very usable\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/LukasBudach/FinanceScraper", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "FinanceScraper", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/FinanceScraper/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/FinanceScraper/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/LukasBudach/FinanceScraper"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/FinanceScraper/0.2.1/", "requires_dist": ["requests"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "An up-to-date web scraper providing financial data from various sources", "version": "0.2.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Finance Scaper <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/LukasBudach/FinanceScraper\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Build Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/be5f04e198afcbba62261ac266c0444abd3299bb/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f4c756b61734275646163682f46696e616e6365536372617065722e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a> <a href=\"https://codecov.io/gh/LukasBudach/FinanceScraper\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"codecov\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/6841e184cf77997b910837faa08bd105a1b91171/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f762e696f2f67682f4c756b61734275646163682f46696e616e6365536372617065722f6272616e63682f6d61737465722f67726170682f62616467652e737667\"></a></h1>\n<p>This project aims to provide an up-to-date data scraper for yahoo finance as a simple stock data API.\nFor an in-depth view on the project check out its <a href=\"https://financescraper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" rel=\"nofollow\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>The purpose &amp; why to use Finance Scraper</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of APIs allowing you to pull stock/market data available for python.\n<a href=\"https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pandas Data Reader</a>,\n<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/googlefinance/\" rel=\"nofollow\">googlefinance</a>,\n<a href=\"https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#getting-started\" rel=\"nofollow\">IEXTrading</a> are a just a few\nof the massive amounts of data sources you could use for your application.</p>\n<p>So <strong>why use the FinanceScraper API</strong>?

It is a python module. Then, just create an exam.py file for example.\n\nYou need set up five variables in the module: institution name, course name, professor name, exam title, questions.\nBelow there is an example of an exam file:\n\n\n```python\ninstitution = \"Federal University of Paraiba\"\ncourse = \"Artificial Intelligence\"\nprofessor = \"Yuri Malheiros\"\nexam = \"2nd Exam\"\n\nquestions = [\"question1\", \"question2\", \"question3\", \"question4\", \"question5\"]\n```\n\nThe first four items are very direct, you only need to put the text you want.\nFor the questions, you must provide a list with the names of the question files.\nIn the case above, the exam has five questions.\nThe first question was created in the file called question1.md, the second in the file question2.md and so on.\n\nLet's check how to create a question file.\n\n\n## Creating a question\n\nA question file follow a markdown-ish syntax.\nBelow there is an example of a question file:\n\n```markdown\nWhich algorithm is used for unsupervised machine learning:\n\n---\n\n- KNN\n- Linear regression\nx K-means\n- Decision tree\n- Logistic regression\n```\n\nThe file has two parts divided by the \"---\" line. The first part (above the ---) is the question text. You can write any markdown in that part. In the second part (below the ---) you put the answers. They must be created as a list, and the correct one has an \"x\" instead of \"-\".\n\n\n### Comments\n\nQuestions may have a comment section. For this, you need to insert a extra \"---\" line after the answers. Below the \"---\" you can write any comment you want. Check the example below:\n\n```markdown\nWhich algorithm is used for unsupervised machine learning:\n\n---\n\n- KNN\n- Linear regression\nx K-means\n- Decision tree\n- Logistic regression\n\n---\n\nThis is a comment.\n```\n\n\n## Generating an exam\n\nTo generate an exam, use the Command Line Interface (CLI).\n\n```bash\nexamgen -e EXAM_FILE\n```\n\nEXAM_FILE is the python file with the information of the exam.\n\nThe CLI supports other options:\n\n- **-rq, --random-questions**: randomize the questions positions in the exam.\n- **-ra, --random-answers**: randomize the answers positions in each question.\n- **-b, --batch**: generate multiple exams.\n- **-q, --quantity INTEGER**: set the number of exams in batch generation.\n- **-m, --merge**: merge all exams in one file in batch generation.\n- **-fb, --front-and-back**: use this option if you want to print the merged exams using the front and back of the sheets.\n\nNote: ExamGen uses pandoc to generate PDF files from Markdown.\n\n\n## Question bank\n\nRandomize question order sometimes is not the behavior we want. So, we provide an alternative way to \nmix questions in exams. \n\nUsing question bank, you can create many questions and set which questions can appear as the first question, or in the second question, or third, etc.\n\nTo do this you only need to set the questions in the exam file as follows:\n\n```python\ninstitution = \"Federal University of Paraiba\"\ncourse = \"Artificial Intelligence\"\nprofessor = \"Yuri Malheiros\"\nexam = \"2nd Exam\"\n\nquestions = [(\"q1v1\", \"q1v2\"), (\"q2v1\", \"q2v2, q2v3\"), \"q3\", (\"q4v1\", \"q4v2\"), \"q5\"]\n```\n\nIn the example above, the first question will be picked randomly between the questions in the files q1v1.md and q1v2.md. The second question will be q2v1.md, q2v2.md or q2v3.md. Notice that not all questions need to have multiple possibilities, it this example, the third question will always be the question in the file q3.md. The fourth question also have two possibilities, and the last question will always be q5.md.\nIn summary, use a tuple to define the possible questions, and the exam generator will pick one randomly.\n\nThis feature is very useful for generating multiple random exams.", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/yurimalheiros/examgen", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "examgen", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/examgen/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/examgen/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/yurimalheiros/examgen"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/examgen/0.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Generate exams using Markdown and Python", "version": "0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            # Exam Generator<br><br>Generate exams using Markdown and Python.<br><br><br>## Features<br><br>- Write questions in Markdown<br>- Generate PDF exams<br>- Generate answer keys<br>- Randomize questions and answers<br>- Generate multiple randomized exams<br><br>## Install<br><br>Using pip:<br><br>```<br>$ pip install examgen<br>```<br><br>Using the repository code:<br><br>```<br>$ python setup.py install<br>```<br><br>## Creating an exam<br><br>First you need to create an exam file.

In case,\na URL is changed for some reason, however, this can reflect badly in\nterms of SEO as search engines do not appreciate ending up on a 404\npage when crawling a known URL. To handle these situations nicely\n``django-url-tracker`` keeps track of URL changes and when the *old*\nURL is called provides a permanent redirect (HTTP 301) or a gone\nresponse (HTTP 410) for deleted URLs.\n\nThe tracking is aimed at those URLs that are generated based on\nmodel fields, e.g. a *slug* field. To start tracking URL changes\nfor a particular model, you simply have to register the model\nwith ``url_tracker`` and everytime a model is changed or deleted,\nURL changes are recorded.\n\nThe HTTP repsonses that provide an ``HttpResponsePremanentRedirect``\nor ``HttpResponseGone`` are handled similar to the ``flatpages``\nmiddleware, intercepting ``404`` exceptions and checking for the\nrequested URLs in all existing ``URLChangeRecords``. Depending\non the recorded data the corresponding HTTP response is return or\na ``404`` is raised when no URL matching the requested one can be\nfound.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstallation is as easy as::\n\n    pip install django-url-tracker-fork\n\nDone!\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nTo start using ``url_tracker`` in your project. Just add the\nfollowing two lines to your ``settings.py``:\n\n1. Add the middleware ``url_tracker.middleware.URLChangePermanentRedirectMiddleware``\n   to the end of  ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` which should look similar\n   to this afterwards::\n\n        MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (\n            'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',\n            'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',\n            'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',\n            'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',\n            'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',\n            'django.contrib.flatpages.middleware.FlatpageFallbackMiddleware',\n            'url_tracker.middleware.URLChangePermanentRedirectMiddleware',\n        )\n\n2. Add ``url_tracker`` and ``django.contrib.contenttypes``, included by\n   default, to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::\n\n        INSTALLED_APPS = (\n            \"django.contrib.contenttypes\",\n            \"url_tracker\",\n        )\n\n\nNow you are able to use ``url_tracker`` within you project. All that\nremains to do is registering a model for tracking.\n\nTracking A Model\n----------------\n\nThis is just a simple example of how to track a model. Let's assume we\nhave a model ``Project`` that hold details on this particular project and\nis made available at the URL ``http://www.example.com/project/some-project/``.\nThe project's URL is based on the ``SlugField`` of our model. The model could\nlook like this::\n\n    class Project(models.Model):\n        name = models.CharField(max_length=20)\n        slug = models.SlugField(max_length=20)\n        description = models.CharField(max_length=500)\n\n\nI will not go into details of how to create the slug as I think this is\ncommon practise. So for now we just assume that ``slug`` is populated\nautomatically from ``name``. One other thing, however, is required for\nthe tracker to work, the ``get_absolute_url`` method. Let's add this to\nthe model::\n\n    class Project(models.Model):\n        ...\n\n        @models.permalink\n        def get_absolute_url(self):\n            return ('project-detail', (), {'slug': self.slug})\n\nAnd now the missing link to actually start tracking URL changes. Add the\n``URLTrackingMixin`` to your model and add the following command to the\nbottom of the class definition (or the file if you prefer that)::\n\n    import url_tracker\n\n    class Project(url_tracker.URLTrackingMixin, models.Model):\n        ...\n\n    url_tracker.track_url_changes_for_model(Project)\n\n\nTo change which functions are called to tracks urls, add a\n``url_tracking_methods`` attribute to the clast, which is a list of\nmethod names to track. By default the the list contains\n``get_absolute_url``.\n\nYou are done. If you go to the admin interface, create a new project\nand then change its slug (which changes its URL) you will see a new\n``URLChangeRecord`` reflecting the change. Opening the ``old_url`` should\nthen redirect you to the ``new_url``.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nIf you find issues or would like to see a feature suppored, head over to\nthe `issues section:\n<https://github.com/saulshanabrook/django-url-tracker/issues>`_ and report it.\n\nTo contribute code in any form, fork the `github repository:\n<https://github.com/saulshanabrook/django-url-tracker>`_ and clone it locally.\nCreate a new branch for your feature::\n\n    git commit -b feature/whatever-you-like\n\nThen make sure all the tests past (and write new ones for any new features)::\n\n    ./run_tests.py\n\npush the finished feature to github and open a pull request form the branch.\n\nIf you make a change to models.py that requires a database migration,\nuse ``django-mini.py -p -a url_tracker -a south -a django.contrib.contenttypes schemamigration url_tracker --auto`` to create a south migration.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/saulshanabrook/django-url-tracker", "keywords": "seo,django,framework", "license": "BSD", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "django-url-tracker-forl", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-url-tracker-forl/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-url-tracker-forl/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/saulshanabrook/django-url-tracker"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-url-tracker-forl/0.1.4/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A little app that trackes URL changes in a database table to provide HTTP 301 & 410 on request.", "version": "0.1.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/saulshanabrook/django-url-tracker\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"https://travis-ci.org/elbaschid/django-url-tracker.png\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/fe0657a1fc5a9210e2a0a6a76984d3b58fb484fd/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f656c626173636869642f646a616e676f2d75726c2d747261636b65722e706e67\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://coveralls.io/r/saulshanabrook/django-url-tracker\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"https://coveralls.io/repos/elbaschid/django-url-tracker/badge.png?branch=master\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/7ee92e74b9d5a28f1af248820d10ec307d3da0e9/68747470733a2f2f636f766572616c6c732e696f2f7265706f732f656c626173636869642f646a616e676f2d75726c2d747261636b65722f62616467652e706e673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a>\n<p>The <tt><span class=\"pre\">django-url-tracker</span></tt> is meant to be a easy-to-use addition to\na website to enhance its SEO.

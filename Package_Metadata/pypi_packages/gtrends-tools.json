While Google Trends has a publicly available browser tool at <http://trends.google.com/trends> with unofficial interfaces in Python [[1]](https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends) and R [[2]](https://github.com/PMassicotte/gtrendsR), the Google Health Trends API provides more control in selecting data, has higher download rates, and arguably returns more precise search trends. However, to use this tool, a Google Health Trends API key is required for access to Google's servers.\n\nI hope to expand this package by adding tools for Google Correlate and methodologies for feature selection and engineering of search queries. The aim is to provide more relevant and accurate data for machine learning projects.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install gtrends-tools with pip, run: `pip install healthtrends`\n\nTo install gtrends-tools from source, first clone the repository and then run:\n`python setup.py install`\n\n\n## Usage\n\nHere is a simple example of `gtrends-tools` usage.\n\n```python\nimport healthtrends\n\nDIR = '/home/fl16180/'\n\nqueries = ['tofu', 'exercise']\n\ngt = healthtrends.TrendsSession(api_key='xxx')\ngt.request_trends(term_list=queries, geo_level='country', geo_id='US')\ngt.save_to_csv(directory=DIR, fname='healthy_trends.csv')\n\n```\n\nParameters for request_trends are:\n- term_list: list of search term queries\n- geo_level: geographic location, one of 'country', 'region', or 'dma'\n- geo_id: name of the geographic location, e.g. 'US' (country), 'US-NY' (region), '501' (dma)\n- start_date: first day to download data from, in form 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Defaults to 2004-01-04.\n- end_date: last day to download data from, in form 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Defaults to today's date.\n- freq: time interval of data, one of 'day', 'week', 'month', 'year'. Defaults to 'week'\n\nFor additional examples, refer to the [included scripts](bin/example.py). I will add more detailed documentation of parameters later, as well as scripts to get data remotely (for IP restrictions on API access).\n\n\n## Research\nSearch frequencies obtained from the Google Trends API using this code (or previous versions) have been an integral part of research papers including [[1]](https://publichealth.jmir.org/2018/1/e4/).\n\n## Credits\nPackage structure inspired by <https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends>\n\nThe original Google Health Trends API script has been passed around a few times before being adapted by Andre Nguyen and passed to me.

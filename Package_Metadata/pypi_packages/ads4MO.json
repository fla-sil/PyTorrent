It is possible download data by MONTH, DEPTH or DAY until a maximum of three selected variables(Planning to increase this number thought).\nIt brings in a very intuitive scripting way what was already proposed with [MerOC](https://github.com/carmelosammarco/MerOC).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"\" height=\"380\" src=\"DATA/FILE.gif\">\n</p>\n\n## Be aware that:\n\nThe tool is in development so it can be possible find bugs, errors and imprecisions. Please to report them if you find one.\n\n## Dependencies:\n\nThe dependencies required which are not installed by default are listed below:\n\n- [x] motuclient>=1.8.1\n- [x] ftputil>=3.4\n\n## Installation and module usage\n\nIt is possible to install and then use in both UNIX and Windows operative systems following the below steps:\n\n```\npip install ads4MO\n```\nwe can import the module as:\n\n```\nfrom ads4MO import download\n```\nOnce the module is imported we can call the interactive download process typing;\n\n```\ndownload()\n```\n\nAt this point the system is going to ask:\n\n- **Username and password**\n\n- **Type of the download** which can be set typing one of the following:\n\n     - **MONTH**: The entire period selected will be downloaded by months\n     - **DEPTH**: The entire period selected will be downloaded by depth levels\n     - **DAY**: The entire period selected will download as daily files\n     - **MONTH&DEPTH**: The entire period selected will be downloaded by months and depth levels\n     - **YEAR**: The entire period selected will be downloaded by years. Very usefull just when you want extract a grid point (The --longitude-min = --longitude-min and --latitude-min = --latitude-max).\n\n- **Starting/Ending Time**: If not values as HH:MM:SS are typed then \"12:00:00\" is going to be used as default value.\n\n- **Motu client script** which is generated by the CMEMS web portal.\nPlease to copy and paste just from the \"--motu\" until the end. You can leave untouched   \"--out-dir <OUTPUT_DIR> --out-name <OUTPUT_FILENAME> --user <USERNAME.> --pwd <PASSWORD.>\" because they were already set previously.\n\nFollowing an example of the full script generted by the Web-portal:\n\n```\npython -m motuclient  --motu http://nrt.cmems-du.eu/motu-web/Motu --service-id GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_001_024-TDS --product-id global-analysis-forecast-phy-001-024 --longitude-min -180 --longitude-max 179.9166717529297 --latitude-min -80 --latitude-max 90 --date-min \"2019-04-19 12:00:00\" --date-max \"2019-04-19 12:00:00\" --depth-min 0.493 --depth-max 0.4942 --variable thetao --variable bottomT  --out-dir <OUTPUT_DIR> --out-name <OUTPUT_FILENAME> --user <USERNAME> --pwd <PASSWORD>\n```\n\nWhat you need to use as module's input:\n\n```\n--motu http://nrt.cmems-du.eu/motu-web/Motu --service-id GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_001_024-TDS --product-id global-analysis-forecast-phy-001-024 --longitude-min -180 --longitude-max 179.9166717529297 --latitude-min -80 --latitude-max 90 --date-min \"2019-04-19 12:00:00\" --date-max \"2019-04-19 12:00:00\" --depth-min 0.493 --depth-max 0.4942 --variable thetao --variable bottomT  --out-dir <OUTPUT_DIR> --out-name <OUTPUT_FILENAME> --user <USERNAME> --pwd <PASSWORD>\n```\n\nThe results are going to be downloaded in the file path in which the terminal/command-prompt was at the moment of the data request.\n\n## Stand-alone applications (No Python installation required):\n\n---------\n\n**The stand-alone App for Windows OS can be downloaded from [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e5ilv9x84m4m0gk/ads4mo-win.exe?dl=0).**\n\nThe APP was developed, compiled and tested in Windows 10 environment. As soon as I have time I will try to test it in other Windows environments. It will generate a folder called \"CMEMS_DATA\" in which all the data downloaded are going to be stored. This folder will be stored in the same system path where the executable \"ads4mo-win.exe\" is located.\n\n---------\n\n**The stand-alone App for macOS can be downloaded from [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vimrdqhcri5tevm/ads4mo-macOS.zip?dl=0).**\n\nIf the APP doesn't start because of \"unidentified developer\" message then you need to give the system the permission to run it. In more details, please to go in **Security & Privacy** (Tab \"General\") and then click on the button which will allows the execution of the tool. It will create a Desktop folder called \"CMEMS_DATA\" which will store all the data downloaded.\n\n---------", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/carmelosammarco/d4mo", "keywords": "", "license": "gpl-3.0", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "ads4MO", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ads4MO/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ads4MO/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/carmelosammarco/d4mo"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ads4MO/0.0.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "~=3.6", "summary": "Python module which adds new CMEMS downloads services (applied mainly to big data requests)", "version": "0.0.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>ads4MO - Added Download Services for Mercator-Ocean</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://travis-ci.com/carmelosammarco/ads4mo\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Build Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/b6ab6296b3b506634a90fca154353ce660ccaa77/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e636f6d2f6361726d656c6f73616d6d6172636f2f616473346d6f2e706e67\"></a> <a href=\"https://ci.appveyor.com/project/carmelosammarco/ads4mo\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Build status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/c6a33f9f6121fdd8558c429948caedf594f65ba8/68747470733a2f2f63692e6170707665796f722e636f6d2f6170692f70726f6a656374732f7374617475732f7934676c6337643763636a62386469713f7376673d74727565\"></a> <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/ads4MO/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"PyPi\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/5a741233d564ba19309ca7ffd856f6ab08cb5b59/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f507950692d50726f6a6563742d79656c6c6f772e737667\"></a> <a href=\"https://gitter.im/ads4mo/community?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Gitter\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/a0b7a4e49af8c5b98dcd2c33d407d2988dfa3907/68747470733a2f2f6261646765732e6769747465722e696d2f616473346d6f2f636f6d6d756e6974792e737667\"></a></p>\n<p>I developed this software while working as <a href=\"https://www.akka-technologies.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">AKKA</a> consultant engeneer for the <a href=\"http://marine.copernicus.eu\" rel=\"nofollow\">CMEMS's Service Desk (Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service)</a>.

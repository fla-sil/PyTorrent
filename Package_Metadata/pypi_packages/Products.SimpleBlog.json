It has no\nfancy blogger-api/backlink stuff etc. It does support\ncategories. Writing entries is done from inside Plone.\n\nSimpleBlog comes with three new portal types: Blog, BlogFolder and\nBlogEntry:\n\n- Blog: Folderish object that is the container for the BlogEntries and\n  the front-page of the weblog.\n\n- BlogEntry: Entry object inside the weblog.\n\n- BlogFolder: Folder that can only exist inside the Blog\n  container. The folder allows you to organize the BlogEntries in any\n  way you like.\n\nGetting started\n===============\n\nAfter you have set the permissions correctly in ZMI (see install.txt)\nyou can go to any folder that you have permissions for and add a Blog\nfrom any of the dropdown lists. You will be given a form where you can\nprovide the necessary information to create a new Blog:\n\n* **Short Name**, **Title**, **Description** will speak for\n    themselves.\n\n* **BlogEntries to display** defines how many items should be visible\n    on the Blog's front-page.\n\n* **Possible Categories** is a list of categories that can be used\n    inside BlogEntries (one category per line). More about categories\n    later.\n\nAfter you have created the Blog, you can adjust its Display settings\nfrom the Display menu in Plone. Currently there are 3 different\ndisplay settings. Besides these settings, there is also a stylesheet\nin product's skin that you can customize at will.\n\nAfter you have created the Blog, you can start creating BlogEntries.\nChoose BlogEntry from the Add items list and fill in the form:\n\n* **Short Name**, **Title**, **Description**, **Body** will speak for\n  themselves. **Note** when you use the Upload a file field, be aware\n  that it will replace the current content!!\n\n* **Cross-post in** here you can pick another blog in the portal where\n  this entry will also be shown.\n\n* **Always on top** Controls if the Entry, when published is always\n  shown first. This can be handy for announcements etc.\n\n* **Categories** Select one or more categories from the list to\n  classify the BlogEntry.\n\n* **Related items** point to other content in your portal to indicate\n  them as related.\n\n* **Allow Discussion on this item** control whether people can comment\n  on this entry.\n\nAfter the BlogEntry is saved, it will be in the 'draft' workflow state\nand is only visible by the owner and the manager (by default).  So, in\norder to make it appear on the Blog's front-page, it must be set in\nthe 'published' state. The Blog will search and display the\nBlogEntries that have this state (this state is defined in the\nsimpleblog_tool in ZMI and in the configlet in Plone setup). When\nputting the BlogEntry in the published state, you can also choose to\ngive it an effective date somewhere in the future. SimpleBlog uses the\nstandard way of publishing content.\n\nInside the Blog you can create BlogFolders. These are a bit similar to\nthe Blog itself in that it has roughly the same view but this time it\nonly shows the Entries that are stored inside the BlogFolder (and\nsubfolders). BlogFolders are there for your convenience, to organize\nor archive Entries in any way you want and to have additional\ncategories (see below).\n\nCategories\n==========\n\nSimpleBlog can use categories to classify BlogEntries. When you edit\nand configure the Blog object, you can provide it with a list of\ncategories that will present itself as a multi-selection list when you\nedit/create a BlogEntry.  Next to that, BlogFolders can define\nadditional categories.  In BlogEntries created inside the BlogFolder,\na selection can be made out of the categories defined in the Blog\n*and*, additionally, out of the ones defined by the BlogFolder(s) it\nsits in. All the categories will add up. This feature can be useful\nwhen the Blog is maintained by several authors. You can then\nincorporate some policy that certain Entries must be created in\nspecific BlogFolders because of the additional categories. Categories\nyou can later search for but you don't want exposed to all the other\nauthors.\n\nNext to categories defined by the Blog object and the BlogFolders, you\ncan also define a set of global categories. These categories are\navailable to all the BlogEntries created in the portal.  Defining\nthese global categories can be done in ZMI in the simpleblog_tool or\nin the Plone setup.\n\nBlogEntries can be searched for in the Catalog and in Topics using\ncategories. Use the EntryCategory index.\n\nThe blog portlet\n================\n\nSimpleBlog comes with a fully configurable portlet than can show 4\ndifferent parts: recent entries, categories, a calendar widget and\nrecent comments. You can use plone's portlet manager to configure each\nportlet. SimpleBlog's configlet in the Site Setup allows you to\ncontrol how and if portlets are created in new Blogs that are added to\nthe portal. Also note that the portlet can be used outside the context\nof a Blog. In that case it will aggregated entries from all Blogs\ninside the folder hierarchy from where the porlet is shown.\n\nConfiguring SimpleBlog\n======================\n\nSimpleBlog allows you to control a few things in its behavior. Go to\nSite Setup in your plone instance.\n\nUsing SimpleBlog as your homepage in Plone\n==========================================\n\nInside the skin folder there is a template called\n**simpleblog_standalone**. First get rid of the current index_html in\nyour portal root by deleting it or renaming it. Then create a new Page\ntemplate in the root and call it index_html.  Then copy/paste the code\nfrom simpleblog_standalone in there and adjust it at will. All this is\ndone in ZMI.\n\nWell, that's all you have to know to set up SimpleBlog. Enjoy it.\n\n=======\nHistory\n=======\n\n3.0\n===\n\n    - Initial egg release [jvloothuis]\n\n3.0-beta1\n=========\n\n    - Register types with portal_diff.\n      [wichert]\n    - Added a permission that controls the portlet rendering.

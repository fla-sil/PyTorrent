The variance and standard deviation are also measures of spread, but they are more affected by extremely high or extremely low values and non normality. If your data is normal, the standard deviation is usually the best choice for assessing spread.

Where a range is a measure of where the beginning and end are in a set, an interquartile range is a measure of where the bulk of the values lie. That\u2019s why it\u2019s preferred over many other measures of spread (i.e. the average or median) when reporting things like school performance or SAT scores.\n\nThe interquartile range formula is the first quartile subtracted from the third quartile:\nIQR = Q3 \u2013 Q1.\n\n'ReadMore https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/probability-and-statistics/interquartile-range/\"_\n\n\nInstallation\n---------------\n* Install from python pacakage 'or'\n -pip install robustbase\n\n* Clone the repo and run \n - python3 setup.py install\n\nHow to Use\n---------------\ncode:: \n\n  from robustbase.robustbase import Qn\n  import numpy as np\n\n  data = np.random.rand(10)\n  print(Qn(data))\n\nReferences\n------------\nsoon...\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/deepak7376/robustbase", "keywords": "Sn Qn MAD IQR", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "robustbase", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/robustbase/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/robustbase/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/deepak7376/robustbase"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/robustbase/0.2.1/", "requires_dist": ["certifi (==2019.11.28)", "docutils (==0.15.2)", "numpy (==1.18.0)", "statistics (==1.0.3.5)"], "requires_python": ">=3", "summary": "A Python Based Library to Calculate Estimators (Sn, Qn, MAD, IQR)", "version": "0.2.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>robustbase</h1>\n<p>A Python Library to Calculate Estimators.</p>\n<p>:Author: Deepak Yadav\n:Version: 2.0\n:Copyright: This document has been placed in the public domain.</p>\n<p>.. contents::</p>\n<h2>Qn scale estimator</h2>\n<p>The median absolute deviation (MAD) and interquartile range are the two most commonly used robust alternatives to the standard deviation.

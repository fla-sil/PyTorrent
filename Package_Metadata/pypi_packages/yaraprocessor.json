With YARA you can create descriptions of malware families based\non textual or binary patterns contained on samples of those families.\n\nHowever, sometimes the data you are analyzing needs some manipulation in\norder to achieve the best results. Yaraprocessor allows you to scan data\nstreams in few unique ways. It supports scanning data streams in discrete\nchunks, or buffers. These chunks can overlap or be completely disjoint\ndepending on the 'processing_mode' selected.\n\nYaraprocessor was originally written for\n`Chopshop <https://github.com/MITRECND/chopshop>`_. Combined with Chopshop, it\nallows for dynamic scanning of payloads plucked from network packet capture.\nHistorically, signature based tools operate over the entire PCAP file. With\nChopshop and Yaraprocessor, YARA can be ran against individual packet payloads\nas well as a concatenation of some or all of the payloads. Ideally, this makes\nwriting signatures easier.

If you are running a service that faces the internet, you likely see thousands of scans, bots, and brute force attempts every day. These scans clog up your log files, and make it hard to find legitimate events of interest.\n\nThe Animus Omni CLI is a utility that leverages the Animus API to reduce noisy entries from your log files. This tool is currently in ALPHA and will be available for free with rate-limited accounts.\n\nHow it Works\n------------\n\nAnimus Omni is powered by a network of sensors that are deployed across the internet. These sensors have no business value, but have a comprehensive set of logging rules. These logs are aggregated and analyzed before being loaded into a database that is made available through the Animus API. omni-reduce analyzes your log files, and passes metadata to our API. The API returns a filter based on your metadata that is then applied to your file. The result is less noisy log files.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nFrom the source repository::\n\n\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nOr via PyPi::\n\n    $ pip install animus-omni\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nThis command will ask you to provide your e-mail address, which will register a rate limited account for you to use for free during the alpha period::\n\n    $ omni-reduce --configure\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nCommandline usage for the omni-reduce tool::\n\n    usage: omni-reduce [-h] [--type {auth,http,generic}] [--noise]\n                       [--out-file OUTFILE] [--stats] [--dry-run] [--port PORTS]\n                       [--configure]\n                       [filename]\n\n    positional arguments:\n      filename              Filename of log file to reduce\n\n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      --type {auth,http,generic}, -t {auth,http,generic}\n                            Log type to analyze\n      --noise, -n           Print the noise from the file rather than reducing it\n      --out-file OUTFILE, -o OUTFILE\n                            Output file for the result\n      --stats, -s           Print statistics to STDERR from the reduction\n                            operation\n      --dry-run, -d         Don't output the reduced log file, only print possible\n                            reduction statistics to STDERR\n      --port PORTS, -p PORTS\n                            Port and protocol used by generic mode.

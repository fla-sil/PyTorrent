I DO NOT recommend using this on a software project directory for obvious reasons. It is fully customizable and any of the default names can be changed if for some reason you don't like the default folder names or perhaps even the extremely inventive name DirectoryCleaner.\n\n---\n\n## Setup\n\nFirst install with pip.\n```\npip install DirectoryCleaner\n```\nThen this should make DirectoryCleaner available from your path. To test this type\n```\nDirectoryCleaner -h\n```\nIf you get the help commands you're all set.\n\n### Windows Specific Extra Step\n\nIf you don't already, set your default encoding for cmd to UTF-8 using this command.\n```\nchcp 65001\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n\nThe most basic form of usage is to clean a messy directory with all the default names. The default names take the form of (file_extension)Full_name_of_file_extension. For example a png files default name is (png)Portable Network Graphics. The default directory name everything will be placed in is named DirectoryCleaner(Current_date).\n```\nDirectoryCleaner /users/username/desktop\n```\n#### Grouping files\n\nThe -gf or --group_files flag will group common file types together into the default group directory names. For example all image files of the format jpg, jpeg, png, tif, tiff, gif, bmp, eps, raw, cr2, nef, orf, and sr2 will be placed in an 'Images' folder with this flag set.\n```\nDirectoryCleaner /users/username/desktop -gf\n```\n\n#### Changing defaults\n\nWith these three flags you can change all the default directory names that your files will be placed in. The prompts they will give you will tell you exactly how to change them. After any of the names are changed those names will be the new defaults everytime you run the program.\n```\nDirectoryCleaner /users/username/desktop -mfn -cfn -cgn\n```\n\n#### Reverting to the default settings\n\nWith this flag you can revert to the default settings if you decided that you in fact love and miss the sensible defaults \ud83d\ude0f.\n```\nDirectoryCleaner /users/username/Desktop -rs\n```\n\n#### Ignoring dotfiles\n\nIf you don't want your precious dotfiles to be cleaned up you can pass in the --ignore_dotfiles or -idf flag. By default, unless you had a dotfile named after a common file extension, which is rarely the case, dotfiles would be placed in a folder called 'Unknown'.\n```\nDirectoryCleaner /users/username/desktop -idf\n```\n\n---\n\n## Commands\n\n```\npositional arguments:\n  path                  The path to the directory that you want to cleanup not\n                        actually the word path.

The date will always be\n                        apart of the name, only DirectoryCleaner will be\n                        changed.\n  --revert_settings, -rs\n                        Revert the settings file to its default state when the\n                        program was downloaded. Will use the default settings\n                        to run the program as well.\n  --group_files, -gf    Set this flag if you would like to group commonly used\n                        files like Word Docs, Excel files, PDFs, music files\n                        etc. in folders named after the type of media they\n                        are.\n  --change_folder_names, -cfn\n                        Set this flag if you want to rename one of the default\n                        folder names Directory Cleaner uses for that type of\n                        file.\n  --change_group_names, -cgn\n                        Set this flag if you'd like to rename one of the\n                        default group names.\n  --ignore_dotfiles, -idf\n                        Set this flag if instead of placing dotfiles in an\n                        'Unknowns' folder, you simply want them ignored.                        \n```                        \n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/Cantasaurus/DirectoryCleaner", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "DirectoryCleaner", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/DirectoryCleaner/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/DirectoryCleaner/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/Cantasaurus/DirectoryCleaner"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/DirectoryCleaner/0.3/", "requires_dist": ["tqdm (>=4.25.0)", "pyfiglet (>=0.7.5)", "beautifulsoup4 (>=4.6.3); extra == 'Scraper'", "requests (>=2.19.1); extra == 'Scraper'"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "An easy to use program that will clean a specified directory by placing all loose files in one folder with specified sub folders.", "version": "0.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>DirectoryCleaner</h1>\n<h4>For when you're tired of all that garbage</h4>\n<p><img alt=\"demo\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/7ec6c96a11abad7ffd257652267b3f00365129a7/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f67667973686172652f6469726563746f7279636c65616e65726769662e676966\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>The main focus of this application is to make it as easy as possible to clean up directories that just have a bunch of loose files laying around that may not be that important.

Game character's stats are taken into consideration on each turn, whilst the game herop also possesses some additional skills to help him in battle.\n\n### The story \nOnce upon a time there was a great hero, called Orderus, with some strengths and weaknesses, as all heroes have. \nAfter battling all kinds of monsters for more than a hundred years, Orderus now has the following stats: \n- Health: 70 - 100 \n- Strength: 70 - 80 \n- Defence: 45 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 55 \n- Speed: 40 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 50 \n- Luck: 10% - 30% (0% means no luck, 100% lucky all the time). \n\nAlso, he possesses 2 skills: \n\n- Rapid strike: Strike twice while it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his turn to attack; there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 10% chance he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll use this skill every time he attacks \n- Magic shield: Takes only half of the usual damage when an enemy attacks; there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 20% change he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll use this skill every time he defends. \n\n### Gameplay \nAs Orderus walks the ever-green forests of the Game, he encounters some wild beasts, with the \nfollowing properties: \n- Health: 60 - 90 \n- Strength: 60 - 90 \n- Defence: 40 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 60 \n- Speed: 40 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 60 \n- Luck: 25% - 40% \n\nThe game simulates a battle between Orderus and a wild beast. On every battle, Orderus and the beast are initialized with random properties, within their ranges. \n\nThe first attack is done by the player with the higher speed. If both players have the same speed, than the attack is carried on by the player with the highest luck. \nAfter an attack, the players switch roles: the attacker now defends and the defender now attacks. \n\nThe damage done by the attacker is calculated with the following formula: \n~ **Damage = Attacker strength \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Defender defence**\n\nThe damage is subtracted from the defender\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health. An attacker can miss their hit and do no  damage if the defender gets lucky that turn.  Orderus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 skills occur randomly, based on their chance on each turn. \n### Game over \nThe game ends when one of the players remain without health or the number of turns reaches 20. \nThe application outputs the results for each turn: what happened, which skills were used (if any), the damage done, defender\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health left. \nAdditionally, a winner may be declared if we have a winner before the maximum number of rounds is reached. \n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/sandu-alexandru/hero_game/", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "game-hero", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/game-hero/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/game-hero/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/sandu-alexandru/hero_game/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/game-hero/1.0.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "A HeroGame implemented for demonstration purposes", "version": "1.0.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Game Hero</h1>\n<p>The project developed covers a story game based on turn based combat, where the game hero encounters a wild beast in the forest.

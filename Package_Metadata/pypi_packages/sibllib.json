Our contributions to the science of injury causation and prevention aim to significantly reduce the U.S. warfighter's exposure to serious, severe, and fatal injuries.\n\nFor more information, see our [website](http://www.sandia.gov/biomechanics/).\n\n## Library [![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3610/) [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](https://github.com/sandialabs/sibl#license)\n\n* XYFigure\n  * [Getting started](xyfigure/README.md)\n  * [Documentation](xyfigure/documentation.md)\n  * [Test Cases](xyfigure/test/README.md)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Python 3.6 or higher (the library requires f-strings)\n* Scipy\n* Pillow\n\n```console\n$ python3 -m pip install Pillow\n```\n\n## Workflow\n\nFor an overview, [read the guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) from GitHub.\n\n### Get a local copy of the repository using `git clone` with SSH\n\n```console\n$ cd ~  # Starting from the home directory is optional, but recommended.\n$ git clone git@github.com:sandialabs/sibl.git\n```\n\n### Push to the repository\n\nIf you update the codebase, and wish to have the modifications merged into the main repository, you will need to either *push to the repository* if you are a collaborator (information below), or *create a pull request* if you have forked the repo (information to come).\n\nIn the `~/sibl/.git/config` file, add the following:\n\n```python\n[user]\n    name = James Bond  # your first and last name\n    email = jb007@company.com  # your email address\n```\n\nConfigure ssh keys between your local and the repo.  This assumes to you have an existing public key file in `~/.ssh/id_rsa/id_rsa.pub`.

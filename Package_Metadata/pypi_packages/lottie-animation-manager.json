Instead of including all lottie animations inside of the `static` folder in an application, we think all animation assets should be hosted on a CDN (content delivery network).  \n\nThis way, updates to animation assets don't require changes to the code repository or static asset folder.  This also reduces the overall build size of an application, reducing the website load time for every user session.\n\nLottie Animation Manager is the first half of a larger plan.  Soon, there will be a companion Vue library as well which will let you easily reference your lottie assets hosted on a CDN from inside of your Vue Application.\n\n# Features\n- Upload your lottie animation assets to AWS S3 + Cloudfront CDN with a single command\n- Automatically compress image assets using TinyPNG to save load time before they are uploaded\n\n# Setup/Installation\nSimply install the Lottie Animation Manager library through **pip**:\n```bash\n# most common way:\npip install lottie-animation-manager\n# for people who have multiple versions of python:\npip3 install lottie-animation-manager\n```\n# Usage\n1. Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html)\n```\npip3 install awscli --upgrade --user\n```\n2. Configure / Add your AWS Security Access Keys by entering:\n```\naws configure\n```\n3. Now, using `cd` , navigate to your folder with your lottie asset (which was exported by the Bodymovin plugin).  Your folder layout might look something like this:\n![alt text](documentation_images/sample_animation_folder_layout.png \"Example Lottie Animation Export Directory\")\n5. Call the python application from your command line like so from inside this animation directory:\n```\nlottie-animation-manager\n```\n6. Once the application loads, follow the steps in the lottie animation wizard to upload, compress, and manage your assets to Cloudfront CDN :tada:\n\n# AWS Cloudfront CDN Setup (Background)\nCreate an AWS Cloudfront deployment so that your lottie applications can load quickly worldwide whenever they are called within your application.\nBasic instructions to do this:\n1. Create your AWS security keys by visiting `Your account Name > My Security Credentials` at the top, clicking `Access Keys`, and clicking `Create New Access Key` .  Write down of these securities as you can only see them one time.\n2. Create a basic [s3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/bucket/create):\n![alt text](documentation_images/create_bucket.png \"Create basic S3 bucket\")\nimage above is incorrect, disable block all public access\n3. Uploaded an image asset and set it to read permission `everyone`\n![alt text](documentation_images/upload_test_image.png \"Upload a test image\")\n4. Visit [AWS Cloudfront](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home?#) home\n![alt text](documentation_images/cloudfront_home.png \"Cloudfront home\")\n5. Click `Create Distribution`\n6. Click `Get Started` under **Web**\n![alt text](documentation_images/get_started.png \"Create Distribution - Get Started\")\n7. Enter an `origin domain name` where you are choosing your s3 bucket.  Keep all other default settings the same:\n![alt text](documentation_images/cloudfront_create.png \"Create a distribution settings\")\nClick **Create Distribution**\n8. Let cloudfront create your deployment, this takes a few minutes to complete.\n9. Eventually you will see the status change to `Deployed` and state change to `Enabled`:\n![alt text](documentation_images/deployed_distribution.png \"Deployed CDN Distribution\")\nNote the domain name URL which cloudfront \"creates\" for your new deployment (ending in ****.cloudfront.net), you'll need this in the next step.\n10. Visit your image asset with the new cloudfront endpoint URL to test to make sure your cloudfront CDN deployment is working.\n![alt text](documentation_images/test_image_asset.png \"Test your image asset on cloudfront\")\n# AWS Cost Warning\nPlease be careful using AWS services.

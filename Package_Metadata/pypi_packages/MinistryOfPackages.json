The expectation is that it runs behind a firewall, and also\nmost likely a reverse proxy. It requires PyYAML and Tornado\n(http://www.tornadoweb.org), and it's tested with pip and Python 2.7 It is not\ntested with easy_install, and easy_install support is not a near-term goal or\npriority (Please use pip)\n\n\nWhat Works Now?\n===================\n\nRight now, MinistryOfPackages is usable for simple use cases: \n\n1. It has DirectoryListing support, and that's completely generic. It's\n   meant to be used by command line tools, but the browser presentation\n   works -- it just doesn't have all the fancy icons :)\n\n2. You can do, for example, 'python setup.py sdist upload -r\n   http://localhost:8080/dist', and then leverage the directory listing\n   capability to go to http://localhost/packages and browse to confirm your\n   package made it into the repository. \n\n3. You can 'pip install -i http://localhost:8080/packages <pkg>' on the package you\n   uploaded in point 2 above.\n\n4. If you want to check internal first and fall back to pypi.python.org, there's no global pip config file (yet), so you need to \n   export two environment variables, either in your personal shell init, or in the global shell initialization files: \n\n   PIP_INDEX_URL=http://your.index.internal/packages\n   PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=http://pypi.python.org/simple\n\nThese features still need more testing and a little polish, but they\ngenerally work.\n\nWhat's Up Next?\n====================\n\n1. Completion of a data model (using Redis) to support\n   more of the CLI and browser UI features (like 'register').\n\n2. Fleshing out a proper browser interface. \n\nWhat's After That?\n====================\n\n1. Proxying requests to PyPI for pip, so MinistryOfPackages can be\n   your primary index server for everything.\n\n2. Package caching. \n\n3. PyPI Mirroring (this can technically be done now, but it's not a good\n   solution as it stands). \n\nFeature requests, new ideas, and pull requests are welcome. \n\nWhy are you doing this?\n=======================\n\nI'm after a few different things with this project: \n\n1.  I want something that's blindingly easy to deploy. I don't want to muck\n    with WSGI, CGI, FCGI, whatever. I want to write code and run it, and\n    have something that works. Having used Tornado for numerous other\n    projects (some 'web scale'), I can tell you it works :) \n\n2.  I want some enterprise-y features like proxy requests and package\n    caching.  Those will come later, but I didn't want to start this using a\n    huge multi-headed framework because I want to get to them sooner than\n    later :)\n\n3.  I want to understand distutils, Python package distribution, and all\n    that stuff better.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/bkjones/MinistryOfPackages", "keywords": null, "license": "UNKNOWN", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "MinistryOfPackages", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/MinistryOfPackages/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/MinistryOfPackages/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://github.com/bkjones/MinistryOfPackages"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/MinistryOfPackages/0.9.5/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A minimal PyPI implementation meant for use behind a firewall.", "version": "0.9.5", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"what-is-ministryofpackages\">\n<h2>What is MinistryOfPackages?</h2>\n<p>A simple Python package index server implementation, meant for internal use (at\nleast for now).

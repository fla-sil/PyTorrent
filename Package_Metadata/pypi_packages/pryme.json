Check it out if you're curious, though. The `Decomposition` class is pretty nifty.\n\nThis is (/ will be) a Python module for various number-theoretic operations and combinatorial structures. Certain major functions are memoized to disk for efficiency. For example, output data for `decompose()` (which computes the prime factorization of its argument) is stored in `./memo/decompose.pryme`.\n\nThis module is *not* intended to be suitable or efficient for large primes (> 2^64). The focus of this module is number theory on a more mundane scale. For efficient large primality tests and factorizations, the user is directed towards such modules as `gmpy2` and `SymPy`.\n\n## Usage Guide\n\n`NotImplemented`\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v0.2 (21 March '16)\n\n* Miller-Rabin primality test implemented.\n* `Decomposition`s are properly memoized.\n* `Decomposition` testing script begun.\n\n### v0.1 (13 March '16)\n\nThis is the first pushed version of pryme.

The name sketch is taken from the short C programs that the Arduino IDE complies and uploads to Arduino devices. Arduino sketches have a fixed format: a `setup()` function that is run once and a `loop()` function that is then run repeatedly forever. This format makes it easy to start writing simple programs to control the device. \r\n\r\nSketches uses the same format, allowing you to write simple programs to perform every day tasks, for example controlling a Raspberry Pi's GPIO, with almost no boilerplate code. \r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* **Write low overhead sketch files:** For a functioning sketch you only have to define the interpreter and at one of `setup()`, `loop()`, or `cleanup()` and you're ready to code.\r\n* **Automatic imports:** Sketches will automatically import a selection of commonly used libraries at runtime, meaning you don't have to worry about your import statements.\r\n* **Argument Preparsing:** Sketches will before running your code check the input arguments to ensure the right number of arguments are passed to your script, so you don't have to write code to check they're all there. Simply define the arguments you want as the parameters of your `setup()` function.\r\n* **Clean crashing:** When your code is stopped by user interupt, or otherwise crashes `cleanup()` is run, giving you the opportunity to safely end your program.\r\n* **Error Reporting:** Errors your code throws are printed back to the terminal so you can see where it broke.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe best way to demonstrate this is probably with an example.

The main purpose of Labphew is to provide a basis for those with little coding experience to build their own user-interface for a piece of hardware or to control a measurement. \n\n\n### Python for the Lab\n-------------\nThis project is heavily inspired by the instruction exercise written by [Dr. Aquiles Carattino](https://www.uetke.com), the mastermind behind [Python for the Lab](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/). If you want to learn more (serious!) coding for lab automation with Python, check the excellent [PTFL website](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/) or book him for a course.\n\nPython for the Lab (PFTL) is a code architecture and a programming course for computer-controlled instrumentation. PTFL codes are designed following the MVC design pattern, splitting the code into Controllers for defining drivers, Models for specifying the logic of the experiment, and View for parking the GUI.\nPFTL was developed by [Uetke](https://www.uetke.com) to explain to researchers, through simple examples, what can be achieved quickly with little programming experience. The ultimate goal of this project is to serve as a reference place for people interested in instrumentation written in Python.\n\nYou can find the code of the original exercise at [Github](https://github.com/PFTL/SimpleDaq/), the documentation is hosted at [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/python-for-the-lab/). If you are interested in learning more about Python For The Lab, you can check [Uetke's courses](https://uetke.com/courses/).\n\n## The Labphew package\n-------------\nCurrently, the labphew package contains more wishes than executable pieces.

You can use it to embed a tiled map\ninto your PyQt5 application.  The map can be overlayed with points, images, text\nand other layers.  The map tiles can come from a local source of pre-generated\ntiles or from a tile server.  The tiles may have any desired coordinate system\nas tile coordinates are translated to pySlipQt internal coordinates.\n\npySlipQt works on Linux, Mac and Windows.  Requirements are python 3 and PyQt5.\n\nFor more information visit the\n`GitHub repository <https://github.com/rzzzwilson/pySlipQt/>`_ or view the API\ndocumentation in\n`the wiki <https://github.com/rzzzwilson/pySlipQt/wiki/The-pySlipQt-API>`_.\n\nRelease Notes\n-------------\n\nRelease 0.5 of pySlipQt is early-release and is considered BETA software.\nIt is being released so anyone interested in pySlipQt can run the\n\"pyslipqt_demo.py\" program and get comfortable with the way pySlipQt\nworks.  Note that testing has only been under macOS and no testing has been\ndone on either of Linux or Windows, though the aim is to make pySlipQt\ncross-platform.\n\nThis release has these notes:\n\n1. Some testing has been done, but not comprehensive testing, so please report\n   any errors to me at rzzzwilson@gmail.com and attach the \"pyslipqt.log\" file.\n\n2. \"Box selection\" now works.\n\n3. Wrap-around of tiles doesn't work yet, but I *hope* to have it working even\n   though it will come with some limitations.\n\n4. The included GMT tileset is very old and has a different zoom compared to any\n   tiles from the 'net, such as OSM tiles, for instance.  I hope to fix this\n   later.  The GMT tiles can still be used an example of how to use locally\n   generated tiles.\n\n5. All the \"examples/test_*.py\" programs have been converted to python3\n   and PyQt5, but there may still be problems.\n\n6. Some bugs found and removed.\n\nThe GMT example tileset is included in the \"examples\" subdirectory.  The\ngmt_local_tiles.py tileset code assumes that the zip file has been unzipped in\nthe user's home directory (ie, ~/gmt_local_tiles).  If you put the tiles in any\nother place, please make the appropriate changes in gmt_local_tiles.py or make\nyour own version of gmt_local_tiles.py.\n\nSee the API documentation for the details on how to use pySlipQt.  The\ndemonstration program \"examples/pyslipqt_demo.py\" does require that the pySlipQt\npackage has been installed, though you make run pyslipqt_demo.py from any place\nas long as it is moved along with its required files from the \"pySlipQt/examples\"\ndirectory.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/rzzzwilson/pySlipQt/releases/tag/0.5.1", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/rzzzwilson/pySlipQt", "keywords": "python pyqt5 slipmap map", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "pySlipQt", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pySlipQt/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pySlipQt/", "project_urls": {"Download": "https://github.com/rzzzwilson/pySlipQt/releases/tag/0.5.1", "Homepage": "http://github.com/rzzzwilson/pySlipQt"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pySlipQt/0.5.1/", "requires_dist": ["pyqt5"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "A slipmap widget for PyQt5", "version": "0.5.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>pySlipQt is a \u2018slip map\u2019 widget for PyQt5.

ActionDB is designed to keep events that need to be summoned at a later\ndate persistent. Personally, this will be used when I make discord bots via\nhttps://github.com/b1naryth1ef/disco. However this doesn't mean you\ncan't use this with anything else, you can, and I highly encourage that you do. While this library was designed so that\nyou could easily create and use your own backend, you're welcome to use the sqlite3 backend that comes with it. Lastly,\nI was to talk about what's planned. At some point, I want to do some major refactoring, and separate the client and\nserver. This would allow you connect to a remote database, something that's not essential but nice, but mainly use\nwhatever concurrency library you want. The backend will still be gevent, however the client can be asyncio, trio,\nthreading, etc.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nTo get started, we'll need to create our client, this will also create a action.db file, however the name can be\nchanged when initializing:\n```py\nfrom action import Action\n\naction = Action()\n```\nAfter this, you should add listeners to your heart's content:\n```py\n@action.listen(\"new_msg\")\ndef new_message(name: str, content: str, id: str=None)\n    print(name + \"\\n\\n\" + content + \"\\n\" + \"(\" + id + \")\")\n```\nAnd if you want to do something, such as send a message in 5 minutes, you can do:\n```py\naction.trigger_in(5 * 60, \"new_msg\", \"Hello World!\", \"My name is sam, and I live in a can\", id=\"2323445\")\n```\nThen presuming you're also doing other things, or have utilized ``gevent.joinall``, in 5 minutes you'll see:\n\n    Hello World!\n\n    My name is sam, and I live in a can\n    (2323445)\n\nAnd that's all there is! If you want to see how you can trigger events at an exact time, or other fun stuff, see the\ndocumentation graciously provided below!\n\n### Note:\nYou can import the main classes from action like so:\n```py\nfrom action import Action, ActionBackend, ActionEmitter, Event\n```\nHappy Coding!", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/Zwork101/actiondb", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "actiondb", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/actiondb/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/actiondb/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/Zwork101/actiondb"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/actiondb/1.1.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.6.0", "summary": "The database that doesn't wait for you, it comes.", "version": "1.1.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            # Welcome to ActionDB<br>*The database that doesn't wait for you, it **goes**.*<br><br>![MyPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/MyPy-Passing-blue.svg)<br>![Flake8](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flake8-Pep%208-brightgreen.svg)<br>[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zwork101/actionDB.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Zwork101/actionDB)<br>Full docs [here](https://zwork101.github.io/action/)<br><br>## Introduction<br><br>Welcome to actionDB, the DB that comes to you.

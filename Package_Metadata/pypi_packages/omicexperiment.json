Examples include DESeqDataSet\n(from the package DeSeq2), MRExperiment (from the package\nmetagenomeSeq), phyloseq-class (from the package phyloseq). To my\nknowledge, there exists no similar powerful functionality available to\nusers of python.\n\nThe philosophy of this package is to build upon solid foundations of the\npython scientific stack and try not to re-invent the wheel. Packages\nsuch as numpy and pandas are powerful optimized libraries in dealing\nwith matrix and tabular data, respectively. This package's backend thus\nconsists almost entirely of pandas DataFrames and pandas APIs.\n\nExample code\n------------\n\n::\n\n    from omicexperiment.experiment.microbiome import MicrobiomeExperiment\n    from omicexperiment.filters import Sample, Taxonomy\n\n    mapping = \"example_map.tsv\"\n    biom = \"example_fungal.biom\"\n    tax = \"blast_tax_assignments.txt\"\n\n    #our Experiment object\n    exp = MicrobiomeExperiment(biom, mapping,tax)\n\n    #include only samples with more than 90000 counts\n    exp.filter(Sample.count > 90000)\n\n    ##collapse the OTUs in the _data_ DataFrame to genus level assignment\n    exp.filter(Taxonomy.groupby('genus')) #any taxonomic rank can be passed\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nJust clone the git repository. Hopefully very shortly, the package will\nbe uploaded to PyPi and will be pip-installable.\n\nDue to bugs in handling numpy installation in setuptools, it is better\nto install numpy first using 'pip install numpy'.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nCurrent omicexperiment dependencies:\n\n-  numpy\n-  scipy\n-  pandas\n-  scikit-bio\n-  biom-format\n-  lxml\n-  pygal\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis package is released as open-source, under a BSD License.

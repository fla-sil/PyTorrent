A preprocessor statement\n        is a comment (as appropriate for the language of the file being preprocessed).\n        This way the preprocessor statements do not make an unpreprocessed file\n        syntactically incorrect.\n        \n        For example::\n        \n            pepe -D FEATURES=macros,scc code.py\n        \n        will yield this transformation::\n        \n            ...                                     ...\n            # #if \"macros\" in FEATURES\n            def do_work_with_macros():              def do_work_with_macros():\n                pass                                    pass\n            # #else\n            def do_work_without_macros():\n                pass\n            # #endif\n            ...                                     ...\n        \n        or, with a JavaScript file::\n        \n            ...                                     ...\n            // #if \"macros\" in FEATURES\n            function do_work_with_macros() {        function do_work_with_macros() {\n            }                                       }\n            // #else\n            function do_work_without_macros() {\n            }\n            // #endif\n            ...                                     ...\n        \n        The ``#if`` expression (``\"macros\" in FEATURES`` in the example) is Python\n        code, so it has Python's full comparison richness.  A number of\n        preprocessor statements are implemented::\n        \n            #define VAR [VALUE]\n            #undef VAR\n            #ifdef VAR\n            #ifndef VAR\n            #if EXPRESSION\n            #elif EXPRESSION\n            #else\n            #endif\n            #error ERROR_STRING\n            #include \"FILE\"\n        \n        As well, pepe will do inline substitution of defined variables.\n        Although, this is currently turned off by default because substitution occurs\n        in program strings, which is not ideal. When a future version of\n        pepe can lex languages being preprocessed it will NOT substitute\n        into program strings and substitution will be turned ON by default.\n        \n        Install Notes\n        -------------\n        Installing Pepe is easy::\n        \n            $ pip install pepe\n        \n        Getting Started\n        ---------------\n        \n        Using as a shell command::\n        \n            $ pepe --help\n        \n        Pepe can also be used as a module.

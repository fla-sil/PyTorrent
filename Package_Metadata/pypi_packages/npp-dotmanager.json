You can configure it to symlink your files to their destination\ndirectory with support to different names in backup and working dirs.\nMore, you can manage the config files, that you want to share with\nothers separate from your private ones. Uses git to automatically push\nand pull repositories on backup.\n\n**Current stable version is 0.2.0**\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nYou can install it with pip:\n\n``pip install npp-dotmanager``\n\nOr download the source and use:\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/sxnwlfkk/dotmanager\n    $ cd dotmanager\n    $ python3 setup.py install\n\nRun\n---\n\nYou can run the program with the ``dotmanager`` command. You can explore\nthe arguments with ``dotmanager -h`` help function.\n\nIf you don't have root permission, you can use the\n``dotmanager_noroot.py`` script after cloning the repository. In the\nroot dir of the project call:\n\n``python3 scripts/dotmanager_noroot.py -h``\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nDotmanager needs a configuration file to run, and checks first in\n``~/.dotfile``. You can specify a config file from another directory\nwith calling:\n\n``dotmanager -d ~/path/to/alternative/dotfile``\n\nConfiguration file\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe configuration file needs to be formatted in YAML, in the following\nfashion:\n\n::\n\n    repositories:\n        private:\n            dir: /home/user/path/to/backup/directory\n            url: https://example@bitbucket.org/configs.git\n        public:\n            dir: /home/user/path/to/public/respitory\n            url: https://github.com/example/configs.git\n\n    backup-folders:\n        scripts:\n            target: ~/bin/\n            public:\n                - first_script\n                - second_script\n            private:\n                - third_script\n        home:\n            target: ~/\n            public:\n                - .vimrc\n                - .tmux.conf\n                - [.newsbeuterrc, ~/.newsbeuter/config/.newsbeuterrc]\n            private:\n                - .zshrc\n                - .dotfile\n                - .netrc\n                - [ranger.conf, ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf]\n\n*This example config file is available in the source repositories.*\n\nThe ``repositories`` and ``backup-folders`` are mandatory levels.\nRepositories needs to have at least a private level, where the ``dir``\nneeds to be set to the backup folder, and the ``url`` is only needed, if\nyou want to use the Git functionality.\n\nThe keys in the ``backup-folders`` are the name of the directories\ninside your backup folder **(at the moment you need at least one, and\nit's also a good idea to structure your backup files)**. The ``target``\nkey determines the working directory, where most of the dotfiles will be\nsymlinked.\n\nPublic and Private modes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe files under the ``public`` key will be treated the same as the\nprivate ones, -- symlinked to the target directory -- with the exception\nthat they will be copied additionally to the public directory, if you\nspecified one.\n\nStoring files with alternative name\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you want to store your config files with different name than it needs\nto be in the target directory for whatever reason, you can do that. For\nexample, you want to store ``ranger``'s config file (``rc.conf``) as\n``ranger.conf`` in your backup directory. For this to work, you need to\nspecify the alternative name first, then the path to the target file:\n\n``- [ranger.conf, ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf]``\n\nAlternate target path\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf your file needs to be in other directory than the rest of your files\nin your backup dir, you can specify the alternate path with the above\nmethod.\n\nSetup\n-----\n\nSetup is one of the main modes of work if ``dotmanager``. You can call\nit with public or private. Setup symlinks in both cases both public and\nprivate files to their destination. However public tries to clone the\npublic ``git`` repository, if provided. Else, it makes the directory (if\nit doesnt exists), and copies the public files to their position.\nOptimally you'll need to use this once an install.\n\nPrivate\n~~~~~~~\n\n``dotmanager --setup --private``\n\nPublic\n~~~~~~\n\n``dotmanager --setup --public``\n\nBackup\n------\n\nBackup is the function to call, if you want to migrate your backups to\ntheir git servers. If called with the ``--private`` flag, it just\ncommits the changes in your backup directory, and pushes it to current\nbranch. Called with the ``--public`` flag, it commits and pushes the\nprivate directory, then copies the current state of the public files to\nthe public dir. After that the public repository is also committed and\npushed to the current dir.\n\nPrivate\n~~~~~~~\n\n``dotmanager --backup --private``\n\nPublic\n~~~~~~\n\n``dotmanager --backup --public``\n\nThe ``--no_git`` flag\n---------------------\n\nThe ``--no_git`` flag inhibits every git functionality of the program,\nif you want to use other hosting or version control.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n::\n\n    Copyright (C) 2017, Saxon Wolfkok <saxonwolfkok@gmail.com>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

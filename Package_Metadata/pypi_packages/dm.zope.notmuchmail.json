This package exposes its retrieval\ncapabilities through Zope.\n\n\nFunctionality\n=============\n\nThe package defines two email search views ``email_search_simple``\nand ``email_search_combined``.\n\n``email_search_simple`` presents a simple search form with\na single field ``Search terms``. In this field, you specify\nwhat should be retrieved according to the following\nextract from the ``notmuch`` documentation::\n\n       The  search  terms  can  consist of free-form text (and quoted phrases)\n       which  will  match  all  messages  that  contain  all  of   the   given\n       terms/phrases in the body, the subject, or any of the sender or recipient headers.\n\n       As a special case, a search  string  consisting  of  exactly  a  single\n       asterisk (\"*\") will match all messages.\n\n       In  addition  to free text, the following prefixes can be used to force\n       terms to match against specific portions of an email, (where <brackets>\n       indicate user-supplied values):\n\n            from:<name-or-address>\n\n            to:<name-or-address>\n\n            subject:<word-or-quoted-phrase>\n\n            attachment:<word>\n\n            tag:<tag> (or is:<tag>)\n\n            id:<message-id>\n\n            thread:<thread-id>\n\n            folder:<directory-path>\n\n       The  from: prefix is used to match the name or address of the sender of\n       an email message.\n\n       The to: prefix is used to match the names or addresses of any recipient\n       of an email message, (whether To, Cc, or Bcc).\n\n       Any  term  prefixed with subject: will match only text from the subject\n       of an email. Searching for a phrase in  the  subject  is  supported  by\n       including quotation marks around the phrase, immediately following subject:.\n\n       The attachment: prefix can be used to search for specific filenames (or\n       extensions) of attachments to email messages.\n\n       For  tag:  and is: valid tag values include inbox and unread by default\n       for new messages added by notmuch new as well as any other  tag  values\n       added manually with notmuch tag.\n\n       For  id:, message ID values are the literal contents of the Message-ID:\n       header of email messages, but without the '<', '>' delimiters.\n\n       The thread: prefix can be used with the thread ID values that are  generated  internally  by  notmuch  (and do not appear in email messages).\n       These thread ID values can be seen in the first column of  output  from\n       notmuch search\n\n       The  folder:  prefix can be used to search for email message files that\n       are contained within particular directories within the mail store. Only\n       the  directory  components  below  the top-level mail database path are\n       available to be searched.\n\n       In addition to individual terms, multiple terms can  be  combined  with\n       Boolean  operators  ( and, or, not , etc.). Each term in the query will\n       be implicitly connected by a logical AND if  no  explicit  operator  is\n       provided,  (except  that  terms with a common prefix will be implicitly\n       combined with OR until we get Xapian defect #402 fixed).\n\n       Parentheses can also be used to control the combination of the  Boolean\n       operators.\n\n       Finally, results can be restricted to only messages within a particular\n       time range, (based on the Date: header) with a syntax of:\n\n            <initial-timestamp>..<final-timestamp>\n\n       Each timestamp is a number representing the  number  of  seconds  since\n       1970-01-01  00:00:00  UTC.  This  is  not  the most convenient means of\n       expressing date ranges, but until notmuch is fixed  to  accept  a  more\n       convenient  form, one can use the date program to construct timestamps.\n       For example, with the bash shell the following syntax would  specify  a\n       date range to return messages from 2009-10-01 until the current time:\n\n            $(date +%s -d 2009-10-01)..$(date +%s)\n\n\nWhen you submit the form, an overview of those threads will be presented\ncontaining at least one matching message. You can then examine\na selected thread: this shows you selected header information for\nthe contained messages. Finally, you can examine a selected message.\nCurrently, the package does not yet show message attachments\nand is tested only for plain text messages (as I do not use\nHTML messages, for security and privacy reasons).\n\n``email_search_combined`` combines the search form and the thread overview\nin a single page. It is this view, you would usually use.\n\n\nUser interfaces\n===============\n\nThe package currently supports 2 user interfaces: one based\non JavaScript (more precisely ``jquery`` (http://jquery.com/))\nand a pure HTML interface.\n\nIn the JavaScript based interface, thread and message details\nare shown directly on the threads overview page (using AJAX calls\nand dynamic HTML); in the pure HTML interface, those details\nare shown in separate windows (or tabs).\n\nThe interfaces are not switched automatically based on\nJavaScript availability in the browser. However, the\nJavaScript based interface should work similar to the\npure HTML interface if JavaScript is disabled (though it looks\na bit funny in this setup).\n\nYou decide during configuration which of the two interfaces\nis used.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nThis package requires Zope 2.12 or higher.\n\nThis package should be installable by any of the typical means used\nin a Zope 2 environment (\"buildout\", \"easy_install\", \"pip\").\n\nHowever, it depends on the ``notmuch`` Python package\n(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/notmuch). In order to facilitate\nthe use of a corresponding operating system package (called\n``python-notmuch`` in Debian systems), this dependency is not\ndeclared and you must make this package manually available in\nyour Zope environment.\n\nIn addition, this packages is only useful, when you have set up\na ``notmuch`` database which indexes the email messages you are\ninterested in. Consult the ``notmuch`` documentation for details.\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nThe configuration consists of 3 mandatory parts:\n\n 1.\n\n   register the package's views.\n\n   This currently is done by including the ZCML\n   of ``dm.zope2.notmuchmail.browser.standalone``\n   in your overall ZCML configuration.\n\n   I plan to support a Plone integration in the future.\n   This integration would use Plone's ``formlib`` integration\n   and Plone's ``main_template`` as base rather than provide\n   a standalone base. Looking at the source of ``standalone``,\n   it should not be difficult to implement a Plone integration\n   (in case, you need one before I support it).\n\n 2.\n \n   provide access to the ``notmuch`` database which indexes\n   the interesting mails.\n\n   This is done by registering a\n   ``dm.zope.notmuchmail.interfaces.INotMuchDatabase`` utility.\n   To implement such a utility, you can use\n   ``dm.zope.notmuchmail.notmuchmail.NotMuchDatabase``.\n   Its constructor gets the path to the maildir indexed by\n   ``notmuch``. If you do not provide the path, then\n   standard ``notmuch`` configuration decides where to find\n   the database - usually one configured for the user running\n   the Zope process.\n   ``dm.zope.notmuchmail:user.zcml`` registers the utility in\n   such a way.\n\n 3.\n\n   define at what objects (in the Zope hierarchy) which\n   user interface should be available.\n\n   The JavaScript based interface is available at an object,\n   if this objects provides\n   ``dm.zope.notmuchmail.browser.interfaces.IJqUi``;\n   the pure HTML based interface is available, if it\n   does not provide\n   ``dm.zope.notmuchmail.browser.interfaces.IJqUi``\n   but provides ``dm.zope.notmuchmail.browser.interfaces.IUi``.\n\n   You can use the ``Interfaces`` tab of the\n   \"Zope Management Interface\" (aka \"ZMI\")\n   of an object, to add interfaces to its set of provided interfaces.\n   Alternatively, you could use a ZCML ``class`` directive\n   to let all objects of the respective class provide a specified\n   interface.\n\nBeside these mandatory configuration steps (whithout them, you\ncannot use the functionality), there is an optional configuration:\nyou can define additional message header fields.\nTo do this, you register an adapter providing\n``dm.zope.notmuchmail.interfaces.IAdditionalHeaderItems``\nfor ``dm.zope.notmuchmail.notmuchmail._Delegator`` objects (those\nare wrappers around ``notmuch`` messages). It must return\na sequence of name/value items. Each element\nin the sequence is interpreted as an additional message header field\n(with its corresponding value).", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dm.zope.notmuchmail", "keywords": "email retrieval zope notmuchmail notmuch", "license": "BSD", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "dm.zope.notmuchmail", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dm.zope.notmuchmail/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dm.zope.notmuchmail/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dm.zope.notmuchmail"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dm.zope.notmuchmail/0.1b1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Zope interface to the email indexer and retriever `notmuch[mail]`", "version": "0.1b1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>This package contains a Zope [2] interface to the <tt>notmuch</tt>\npackage (<a href=\"http://notmuchmail.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://notmuchmail.org/</a>). <tt>notmuch</tt> is used for email\nindexing and fast retrieval.

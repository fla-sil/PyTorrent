If you are looking for tools to\nanalyze OLE files or to extract data (especially for security purposes\nsuch as malware analysis and forensics), then please also check my\n`python-oletools <http://www.decalage.info/python/oletools>`_, which are\nbuilt upon olefile and provide a higher-level interface.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nolefile is based on the OleFileIO module from\n`PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm>`_, the excellent\nPython Imaging Library, created and maintained by Fredrik Lundh. The\nolefile API is still compatible with PIL, but since 2005 I have improved\nthe internal implementation significantly, with new features, bugfixes\nand a more robust design. From 2005 to 2014 the project was called\nOleFileIO\\_PL, and in 2014 I changed its name to olefile to celebrate\nits 9 years and its new write features.\n\nAs far as I know, olefile is the most complete and robust Python\nimplementation to read MS OLE2 files, portable on several operating\nsystems. (please tell me if you know other similar Python modules)\n\nSince 2014 olefile/OleFileIO\\_PL has been integrated into\n`Pillow <http://python-imaging.github.io/>`_, the friendly fork of PIL.\nolefile will continue to be improved as a separate project, and new\nversions will be merged into Pillow regularly.\n\nMain improvements over the original version of OleFileIO in PIL:\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-  Compatible with Python 3.x and 2.6+\n-  Many bug fixes\n-  Support for files larger than 6.8MB\n-  Support for 64 bits platforms and big-endian CPUs\n-  Robust: many checks to detect malformed files\n-  Runtime option to choose if malformed files should be parsed or raise\n   exceptions\n-  Improved API\n-  Metadata extraction, stream/storage timestamps (e.g. for document\n   forensics)\n-  Can open file-like objects\n-  Added setup.py and install.bat to ease installation\n-  More convenient slash-based syntax for stream paths\n-  Write features\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nPlease see the `online\ndocumentation <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/olefileio_pl/wiki>`_ for\nmore information, especially the `OLE\noverview <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/olefileio_pl/wiki/OLE_Overview>`_\nand the `API\npage <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/olefileio_pl/wiki/API>`_ which\ndescribe how to use olefile in Python applications. A copy of the same\ndocumentation is also provided in the doc subfolder of the olefile\npackage.\n\nReal-life examples\n------------------\n\nA real-life example: `using OleFileIO\\_PL for malware analysis and\nforensics <http://blog.gregback.net/2011/03/using-remnux-for-forensic-puzzle-6/>`_.\n\nSee also `this\npaper <https://computer-forensics.sans.org/community/papers/gcfa/grow-forensic-tools-taxonomy-python-libraries-helpful-forensic-analysis_6879>`_\nabout python tools for forensics, which features olefile.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nolefile (formerly OleFileIO\\_PL) is copyright (c) 2005-2015 Philippe\nLagadec (`http://www.decalage.info <http://www.decalage.info>`_)\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\nmet:\n\n-  Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n-  Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n   documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\nIS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

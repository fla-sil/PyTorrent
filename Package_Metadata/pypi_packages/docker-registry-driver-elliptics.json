Endpoint is `host:port:af`. `af` is address family as number. Use `2` for IPv4, `10` for IPv6\n1. `elliptics_wait_timeout`: time to wait for the operation complete\n1. `elliptics_check_timeout`: timeout for pinging node\n1. `elliptics_io_thread_num`: number of IO threads in processing pool\n1. `elliptics_net_thread_num`: number of threads in network processing pool\n1. `elliptics_nonblocking_io_thread_num`: number of IO threads in processing pool dedicated to nonblocking ops\n1. `elliptics_groups`: Elliptics groups registry should use\n1. `elliptics_verbosity`: Elliptics logger verbosity (0...4)\n1. `elliptics_logfile`: path to Elliptics logfile (default: `dev/stderr`)\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\nstorage: elliptics\nelliptics_nodes: [\n      \"elliptics-host1:1025:2\",\n      \"elliptics-host2:1025:10\",\n      ...\n      \"host:port:af\" ] # or spaceseparated string\nelliptics_wait_timeout: 60\nelliptics_check_timeout: 60\nelliptics_io_thread_num: 2\nelliptics_net_thread_num: 2\nelliptics_nonblocking_io_thread_num: 2\nelliptics_groups: [1, 2, 3]\nelliptics_verbosity: 4\nelliptics_logfile: \"/tmp/logfile.log\"\nelliptics_loglevel: debug\n```\n\n## Developer setup\n\nClone this.\n\nInstall `Elliptics`:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install curl\ncurl http://repo.reverbrain.com/REVERBRAIN.GPG | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo echo \"deb http://repo.reverbrain.com/precise/ current/amd64/\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list\nsudo echo \"deb http://repo.reverbrain.com/precise/ current/all/\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install elliptics\n```\n\nGet your python ready:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\nsudo pip install tox\n```\n\nStart the test `Elliptics`:\n\n```\ncd fixtures\nsudo ./start.sh\n```\n\nYou are ready to hack.\nIn order to verify what you did is ok, just run `tox`.\n\nThis will run the tests provided by [`docker-registry-core`](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker-registry/tree/master/depends/docker-registry-core)\n\n\n## License\n\nThis is licensed under the Apache license.\nMost of the code here comes from docker-registry, under an Apache license as well.\n\n[pypi-url]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docker-registry-driver-elliptics\n[pypi-image]: https://badge.fury.io/py/docker-registry-driver-elliptics.svg\n\n[travis-url]: http://travis-ci.org/noxiouz/docker-registry-driver-elliptics\n[travis-image]: https://secure.travis-ci.org/noxiouz/docker-registry-driver-elliptics.png?branch=master", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/noxiouz/docker-registry-driver-elliptics/archive/master.zip", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/noxiouz/docker-registry-driver-elliptics", "keywords": null, "license": "Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

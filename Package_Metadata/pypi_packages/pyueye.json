As there is no intelligence in the PyuEye interface, it is as near as possible to the uEye C API and always up-to-date. Benefit from many Python advantages, for example the interactive programming of your uEye camera. Write and test small code snippets without the complex setup of a programming IDE with a toolchain. The PyuEye interface is ideal for prototyping uEye camera applications for all supported uEye platforms (Windows, Linux, Linux Embedded).\n\nYou find more information on this software version in the PyuEye `release notes <https://en.ids-imaging.com/pyueye-release-notes>`_.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n> pip install pyueye\n\nQuickstart\n----------\n\n::\n\n    from pyueye import ueye\n\n    h_cam = ueye.HIDS(0)\n    ret = ueye.is_InitCamera(h_cam, None)\n\n    if ret != ueye.IS_SUCCESS:\n        pass\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n::\n\n PyuEye - uEye API Python bindings\n\n Copyright (c) 2017 by IDS Imaging Development Systems GmbH.\n All rights reserved.\n\n PyuEye is a lean wrapper implementation of Python function objects that\n represent uEye API functions.

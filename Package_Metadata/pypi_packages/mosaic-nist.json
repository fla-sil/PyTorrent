By modeling the nanopore system with an equivalent circuit, MOSAIC leverages the transient response of a molecule entering the channel to quantify pore-molecule interactions. In contrast to existing techniques such as ionic current thresholding or Viterbi decoding, this technique allows the estimation of short-lived transient events that are otherwise not analyzed.\n\nNanometer-scale pores have demonstrated potential use in biotechnology applications, including DNA sequencing, single-molecule force spectroscopy, and single-molecule mass spectrometry. The data modeling and analysis methods implemented in MOSAIC allow for dramatic improvements in the quantification of molecular interactions with the channel in each of these applications.\n\n**If you use MOSAIC in your work, please cite:** `Analytical Chemistry 2016, (88) pp. 11900\u201311907  <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03725>`_ and `ACS Nano 2014, (8) pp. 1547\u20131553.  <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn405761y>`_\n\n\nInstallation\n=================================\n\nPlease refer to the `Installation <https://pages.nist.gov/mosaic/html/doc/GettingStarted.html>`_ section of the MOSAIC documentation for details on installation.\n\n\nGetting Help\n=================================\n\nFor questions and help, please join our `mailing list <https://pages.nist.gov/mosaic/html/doc/mailingList.html>`_. \n\nTo subscribe:\n\n\tEmail `mosaic-request@nist.gov <mailto:mosaic-request@nist.gov?subject=subscribe>`_ with subject 'subscribe'\n\nTo unsubscribe:\n\n\tEmail `mosaic-request@nist.gov <mailto:mosaic-request@nist.gov?subject=unsubscribe>`_ with subject 'unsubscribe'\n\nOnce subscribed, you can send messages by emailing `mosaic@nist.gov <mailto:mosaic@nist.gov>`_.\n\n\nReporting Problems\n=================================\n\nReport problems using our `issue tracker <https://github.com/usnistgov/mosaic/issues>`_ on Github.\n\n\nChange Log\n=================================\n\n**v1.3.5**\n\n- Saves raw events in database.

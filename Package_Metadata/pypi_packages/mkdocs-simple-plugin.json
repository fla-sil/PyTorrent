It is designed for the way developers commonly write documentation in their own code -- with simple markdown files.\n\n## About\n\nYou may be wondering why you would want to generate a static site for your project, without doing the typical \"wiki\" thing of consolidating all documentation within a single `docs` folder or using a single `README` file.\n\n1. My repository is too big for a single documentation source.\n\n    Sometimes it isn't really feasible to consolidate all documentation within an upper level `docs` directory.  This is often the case with medium/large repositories.  In general, if your code base is too large to fit well within a single `include` directory, your code base is probably also too large for documentation to fit within a single `docs` directory.  \n\n    Since it's typically easier to keep documentation up to date when it lives as close to the code as possible, it is better to create multiple sources for documentation.\n\n2. My repository is too simple for advanced documentation.\n\n    If your code base is _very very_ large, something like the [monorepo plugin](https://github.com/spotify/mkdocs-monorepo-plugin) might better fit your needs.\n\n    For most other medium+ repositories that have grown over time, you probably have scattered documentation throughout your code.  By combining all of that documentation while keeping folder structure, you can better surface and collaborate with others. And, let's face it.  That documentation is probably all in markdown, since github renders it nicely.\n\n3. I want a pretty documentation site without the hassle.\n\n    Finally, you may be interested in this plugin if you have a desire for stylized documentation, but don't want to invest the time/energy in replicating information you already have in your README.md files, and you want to keep them where they are (thank you very much).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis plugin was made to be super simple to use.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nYou will need to have [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) installed on your system.  I recommend installing it via pip to get the latest version.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\npip install --upgrade pip --user\npip install mkdocs --user\n```\n\n### Installation\n\nThen, install the plugin.\n\n```bash\npip install mkdocs-simple-plugin\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nIt's easy to use this plugin.  You can either use the generation script included, or set up your own custom config.\n\n#### Basic\n\nBasic usage was optimized around ease of use.  Simply run\n\n```bash\nmkdocs_simple_gen\n```\n\nand you're all set!\n\n#### Advanced\n\nAdvanced usage is _also_ easy.\n\nCreate a `mkdocs.yml` file in the root of your directory and add this plugin to it's plugin list.\n\n```yaml\nsite_name: your_site_name\nplugins:\n  - simple\n```\n\nIf you'd like, you can specify some additional configuration settings.\n\n```yaml\n# simple plugin configuration options\nignore_hidden: True # Ignore md files in hidden directories (those starting with a '.')\nignore_directories: # Folders that should be ignored to add md files\n  - \"drafts\"\n```\n\nNote:  Files in the `docs_dir` (by default `docs`) will be merged with any other documentation in your repository.\n\nThen, you can build the mkdocs from the command line.\n\n```bash\nmkdocs build\n```\n\n### Test\n\nOne of the best parts of mkdocs is it's ability to serve (and update!) your documentation site locally.\n\n```bash\nmkdocs serve\n```\n\n### Deploy\n\nAfter you build, you'll need to initialize your deployment by running the gh-deploy command for mkdocs.  This will set up the gh-pages branch and copy the site over.\n\n```bash\nmkdocs gh-deploy\n```\n\nNext, you'll need to set up your github repository to enable gh-pages support.

Replace references to the dummy package name with your package name via `sh replace_chthonic.sh <your-package-name>`.\n2. Add any package dependencies to `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`.\n   * If you decide to `pip install` new dependencies later on, as you develop, it's all good! Just remember to add them to `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`.\n3. Install the environment with `vagrant up`.\n4. Enter the environment with `vagrant ssh`.\n   * To stop running the environment, exit it with `exit` and halt it with `vagrant halt`\u2014this can save a lot of CPU and memory when you're not working on the package. Bring it up again anytime with `vagrant up`.\n\n## Package Development.\n1. Enter the environment with `vagrant ssh`.\n   * A [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for your package will be automatically activated each time you enter.\n     * The necessary packaging tools are already installed in this venv by default.\n     * Other development tools (e.g., `pylint`) are also installed by default; check out `requirements.txt` for the full list.\n2. Add project files to the appropriate directory (e.g., the package subfolder, whose name is `chthonic` in this example).\n\n## Packaging for PyPI\n1. Enter the Vagrant environment with `vagrant ssh`.\n2. Make sure that your `README.md` is informative about your package.\n3. Make sure that all package dependencies have been added to `setup.py`.\n4. `python setup.py sdist`<sup>1</sup>\n5. `twine upload dist/*` (requires a [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) account).\n6. Done!\n\n## Using Jupyter Notebooks with Vagrant\n1. Enter the environment with `vagrant ssh`.\n2. Inside the environment, run `jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0`.\n3. Copy the bottom-most URL printed to the console (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=5dibo` (the actual token will be way, way, way longer)).\n4. Open your favorite web browser, paste in the URL, and go to it.\n\n<sup>1</sup>Notice that this doesn't issue `bdist_wheel`, in flagrant violation of [the official packaging tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/). I've found wheel construction in Vagrant environments to be a bit buggy and, fortunately, unnecessary for my projects.

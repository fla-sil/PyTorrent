It provides\na sync functionality for which your notes are stored in your Google Drive and\ncan be accessed and modified on other PC's where this application is installed.\nThe application consists of a client-side and server-side. The following subsections\nprovide some more information depending on whether you need sync or not.\n\nI don't need sync\n-----------------\n\nIf you do not wish to make use of the sync facility and are content with storing\nand accessing your notes locally, you do not need to consider the server-side.\nIn this case see the subsection *client-side* under *Installation* to install\nthe client side.\n\nI need sync\n-----------\n\nIf you want to make use of the sync functionality, you need to install the client-side\n(as you would if you didn't want sync). You would also need to have a server running.\nTo setup your own server, instructions are availabe under the subsection *server-side*\nwhich is under *Installation*. Then, create an account with the email associated with\nyou Drive and a password for this account. You can now log in and start using the\napplication. If you need the notes on another PC install the application there and\nlog in using the email and password provided during creation of note0 account.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nClient-side\n-----------\n\nTo install the client-side:\n::\n\n        $ pip install note0\n\nNow you need to set it up (one-time only, which creates a new directory in your home directory):\n::\n\n        $ note0 -s\n\nTo start using the application:\n::\n\n        $ note0\n\nUse the *help* command (after application has been started) to list all possible commands:\n::\n\n        note0> help\n\nServer-side\n-----------\n\nTo setup your own server, you require\n\n- MySQL\n- npm\n- Node.js version 6.9.2 (the server-side wasn't tested using other versions)\n- To use console.developers.google.com to enable the Drive API and create an\n  OAuth Client ID and download the JSON file consisting of the Client ID,\n  Client Secret etc.\n- Downloaded copy of *server.js* and *package.json* from this project. These files can be found in the *server*\n  directory of this project.\n\nCreate a directory (the directory will be assumed to have the name *server_directory*\nfor reference but it is not necessary to name it so) where files required to setup\nthe server will be present.\n\nDownload the *server.js* and *package.json* file to this directory. Rename the JSON file consisting of the\nClient ID etc. to *client_secrets.json* and move it to this directory if not already present here.\nMake this directory into your working directory to install dependencies of *server.js* as follows:\n\n::\n\n        $ npm install\n\nAfter you have installed MySQL, open the *server.js* file and locate the lines where\na connection to the MySQL database is created. This would be near the beginning of the script\nand would look like this:\n\n.. code:: javascript\n\n        var connection = mysql.createConnection({\n                user     : 'usernamehere' ,\n                password : 'wxyz',\n                database : 'drive'\n        });\n\nChange the value of *user* (which is currently *usernamehere*) and *password* (which is currently *wxyz*) to your MySQL credentials.\n\nNow create a database named *drive*:\n\n.. code:: sql\n\n        mysql> CREATE DATABASE drive;\nIn that database create two tables *users* and *sessions*:\n\n.. code:: sql\n\n        mysql> USE drive;\n        mysql> CREATE TABLE users (email VARCHAR(256), pswd VARCHAR(256), token VARCHAR(1024), tkey VARCHAR(256), iv VARCHAR(256),tkey_key VARCHAR(256), directory_id VARCHAR(256));\n        mysql> CREATE TABLE sessions (email VARCHAR (256), skey VARCHAR (512));\n\nNow start the server:\n\n::\n\n        $ node server.js\n\nUsage example\n=============\n\n::\n\n        $ note0\n\n        Welcome to note0\n        Version 0.1.0\n\n        Type 'help' to know more\n\n        Log in status: You are not logged in\n\n         note0>  new\n\n        Successfully created new note\n\n         note0>  open\n\n        Note number: 0\n        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        This is a sample\n        file used in the README of\n        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        Which note do you want to open (note number): 0\n        Note successfully saved\n\n         note0>  delete\n\n        Note number: 0\n        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        This is a sample\n        file used in the README of\n        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        Which note do you want to delete (note number): 0\n        Are you sure you want to delete note number 0 (y/n)?: y\n        Note successfully deleted\n\n         note0>  open\n\n        You do not have any notes\n\n         note0>  delete\n\n        You do not have any notes\n\n         note0>  help\n\n        Documented commands (type help <topic>):\n        ========================================\n        change_password  delete          exit  login   new   set_editor  status\n        create_account   delete_account  help  logout  open  set_url     sync\n\n         note0>  sync\n\n        Sync not possible since you are not logged in\n\n         note0>  help exit\n\n        Use this command to exit the application\n\n         note0>  exit\n        $\n\nNotes are opened in the editor that can be set using *set_editor*.\n\nHow note0 works\n===============\n\nThe client-side consists of a directory *.note0* that is created in the home directory.\nIt stores the notes and a config file containing information regarding who is logged in,\naddress of the server and more. The server stores information on user accounts,\nlogin sessions etc. When the server receives a request, for example to upload a note, it makes use\nof the Google API to upload it to the user's drive.\n\nA note0 account is required to make use of the sync functionality and if an account is created\nthen notes can be stored locally and on Drive. If a note0 account is not created then notes can\nonly be stored locally.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": null, "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/ajay0/note0", "keywords": null, "license": "MIT", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "note0", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/note0/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/note0/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/ajay0/note0"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/note0/0.1.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A command line note taking application", "version": "0.1.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            Introduction<br>============<br><br>note0 is a command-line note taking application written for Linux.

The classes within the library can be thought of as a catalog of tools and methods to retrieve data. Not all data point methods are required for each tool, meaning a new tool can be added with only a single method.

For example, consider the following workflow:\n1.\tCollect data with tool one.\n2.\tCollect data with tool two.\n3.\tWrite code to isolate the data for tool one.\n4.\tWrite code to isolate and data for tool two. \n5.\tMerge data into a standard format.\n6.\tRemove duplicated data.\n7.\tExpose normalized data.\n\nTo summarize, this workflow can be reduced to the following using PyFunnels:\n1.\tSpecify output files\n2.\tInitiate an object.\n3.\tUse method on the object.\n4.\tExpose normalized data.\n\nPyFunnels has been purposely structured for ease of use and extensibility to new tools and data points.

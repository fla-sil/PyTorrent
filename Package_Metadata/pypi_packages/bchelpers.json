But it is pretty low-level and kind of awkward to use.\nThe long-term fix for that is boto3 but in the mean time I've created\na few helpers to make things a bit easier.\n\nUsing bchelpers\n---------------\n\nA simple use would be like this:\n\n    from bchelpers.region import Region\n\n\tregion = Region(region_name='us-west-2', profile='dev')\n\tec2 = region.get_service_endpoint('ec2')\n\tinstances = ec2.call('describe-instances',\n\t                     query='Reservations[*].Instances[*]')\n\nThe variable `instances` would now be a list of dictionaries, each containing\nthe full data for each instance running in this account in this region.\n\nNote the ability to pass a\n[jmespath](https://github.com/boto/jmespath) query in the call.  This\nquery will be run against the raw data from the response so you can\neasily tailor the output to include exactly what you want and only\nwhat you want.  Check out the `jmespath` link for full details on all of\nthe awesome things you can do with it.\n\nI'll probably add more stuff to this over time but I fully expect this to\njust go away eventually and be replaced with boto3.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/garnaat/bchelpers", "keywords": null, "license": "Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

To be of real use these datasets must be interpreted with respect to each other and to refined standards: well-characterized image datasets called atlases. To build these interpretations, dense spatial alignments must be computed. This process is known as image registration, in which one image is optimally deformed, or flowed, until it aligns with another. Accurate registration is challenged by the large scale of imaging data and the heterogeneity across species scales and modalities.

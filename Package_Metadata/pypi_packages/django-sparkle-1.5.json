If you're looking for the base version of django-sparkle, please visit [https://github.com/Mobelux/django-sparkle](https://github.com/Mobelux/django-sparkle)\n        \n        # Requirements\n        \n        * Django >= 1.5\n        * Markdown > 2.1 (for release notes)\n        * django-absolute (for absolute URLs in the link field of the appcast)\n        \n        ## optional requirements\n        \n        * OpenSSL (if you want to have releases signed)  \n        This must be available on the command line as the `openssl` command.\n        \n        \n        \n        # Setup\n        \n        1. `easy_install django-sparkle-1.5` or `pip install django-sparkle-1.5`\n        2. Make sure that `django-absolute` is correctly installed (this needs some additional settings).\n        3. Add `sparkle` to your installed apps\n        4. In `urls.py` include the sparkle URLs by adding something like `(r'^sparkle/', include('sparkle.urls'))`.\n        5. Ensure `MEDIA_URL` is correctly set\n        6. `python manage.py syncdb` to create the tables needed for sparkle.\n        7. Optional: In `settings.py` add `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` which is the path to your private DSA key for signing your releases.\n        8. Optional: Add `SPARKLE_UPLOAD_PREFIX` to your settings (default is `sparkle/`). This component will be added to the media URL for your uploaded versions.\n        \n        # Usage\n        \n        Create an application and optionally add some versions.\n        \n        The application's appcast feed will be available at `/whatever_you/configured_in/your_urls_py/(?P<application_slug>\\d+)/appcast.xml`.\n        \n        Your uploaded versions will be available at `{{ MEDIA_URL }}/SPARKLE_UPLOAD_PREFIX/application_slug/version_number.extension`. You can get the URL for an latest version of an Application by calling `instance.latest().update.url`.\n        \n        Set the `SUFeedURL` key in your Info.plist to point to the sparkle application's appcast URL. `http://example.com/sparkle/app/appcast.xml` for example.\n        \n        If you want to enable system profiling, be sure to set the `SUEnableSystemProfiling` key in your Info.plist to `YES`.\n        \n        # Settings\n        \n        * `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`  \n           The path to your DSA private key for signing releases.  Defaults to `None`.  If not provided, releases will not be automatically signed when uploaded.\n        * `SPARKLE_UPLOAD_PREFIX`  \n        The path prefix that will be added to your uploaded files. Defaults to `sparkle/`. Use this to configure the upload directory in which your release files will end. Note that this prefix will become part of the download URL.

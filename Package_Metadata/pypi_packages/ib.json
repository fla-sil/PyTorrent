Previous versions are not supported.\r\n\r\nTWS requires a web browser capable of executing Sun(R) Java(tm)\r\napplets.  TWS can also be started directly with Sun(R) Java(tm) and\r\nthe stand-alone package supplied by Interactive Brokers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Interactive Brokers?\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFrom the page \"`About The Interactive Brokers Group`__\":\r\n\r\n  Interactive Brokers conducts its broker/dealer and proprietary trading\r\n  businesses on 60 market centers worldwide.

It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.\r\n\r\n  Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has\r\n  modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and\r\n  dynamic typing.  There are interfaces to many system calls and\r\n  libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,\r\n  Mac, MFC). New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python\r\n  is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a\r\n  programmable interface.\r\n\r\n  The Python implementation is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX,\r\n  on Windows, DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga... If your favorite system isn't\r\n  listed here, it may still be supported, if there's a C compiler for\r\n  it. Ask around on comp.lang.python -- or just try compiling Python\r\n  yourself.\r\n\r\n  The Python implementation is copyrighted but freely usable and distributable,\r\n  even for commercial use.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Else?\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIbPy is not a product of Interactive Brokers, nor am I affiliated with\r\nIB.

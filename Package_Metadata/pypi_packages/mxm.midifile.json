When MidiToCode gets a midi event from the midi parser, it prints how the event would look if it was generated with python code using mxm.midifile.\n\n    from mxm.midifile import MidiInFile, MidiToCode\n    test_file = testdir('file-generated.mid') \n    midiIn = MidiInFile(MidiToCode(), test_file)\n    midiIn.read()\n\nWhich will then print:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    midi = MidiOutFile('file.mid')\n\n    midi.header(format=0, nTracks=1, division=96)\n    midi.start_of_track()\n    \n    # note on\n    midi.update_time(0)\n    midi.note_on(0, 0x40, 0x64)\n    \n    # note off one bar later\n    midi.update_time(384)\n    midi.note_off(0, 0x40, 0x40)\n    \n    midi.update_time(0)\n    midi.end_of_track()\n    \"\"\"\n\nIt is not very usefull in itself, but I have found that converting midi files to code like this, makes it a lot easier to understand midi files and how to use this library. It basically turns any midi track into an example. Also you can take the printed output and save it as a .py file. When you run it, it will generate a midi file\n\nReading, changing and saving as a new midi file\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIf you want to do something usefull, like transposing the notes in a midi file, you must subclass the \"MidiOutFile\" and overwrite some of the methods for your own needs.\n\n    class Transposer(MidiOutFile):\n\n        \"Transposes all notes by 'delta' semitones\"\n\n        delta = 24\n\n        def _transp(self, ch, note):\n            if ch != 9: # not the drums!\n                if 0 <= (note+self.delta) <= 127: # dont transpose out of midi range\n                    note += self.\n            return note\n\n        def note_on(self, channel=0, note=0x40, velocity=0x40, use_running_status=False):\n            note = self._transp(channel, note)\n            MidiOutFile.note_on(self, channel, note, velocity, use_running_status)\n            \n        def note_off(self, channel=0, note=0x40, velocity=0x40, use_running_status=False):\n            note = self._transp(channel, note)\n            MidiOutFile.note_off(self, channel, note, velocity, use_running_status)\n\n    in_file  = exampledir('file.mid')\n    out_file = exampledir('file-transposed.mid')\n\n    midi_out = Transposer(out_file)\n    midi_in = MidiInFile(midi_out, in_file)\n    midi_in.read()\n\n\nThe \"MidiEvents\" class in \"src/midi_events.py\" is the full documentation to all the methods that can be overwritten for your own classes. It is also the class you must subclass to make usefull work.\n\nThe \"MidiToCode\" class in \"src/midi_to_code.py\" is a good and simple example of how to make a complete subclass of MidiEvents for your own purpose.\n\nmxm.midifile only reads and writes midi files. There are som rules that must be upheld when making your own midi files. mxm.midifile does not do this for you. So it is possible to make bad midi files with it. If you are in doubt it is practical to use the \"MidiToCode\" to analyze some good midi files and see how they do it.\n\nIf there is interest I will considder making a \"SafeMidiOutFile\" class that will help avoiding writing bad midi files.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nThere are more examples in the \"examples\" directory.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/maxmcorp/mxm.midifile", "keywords": "midi", "license": "MIT License", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "mxm.midifile", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/mxm.midifile/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/mxm.midifile/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/maxmcorp/mxm.midifile"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/mxm.midifile/1.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "A python 3 library for reading, writing and modifying midi files", "version": "1.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            mxm.midifile is a python package for reading, writing and manipulating midi files<br>=================================================================================<br><br>I have made mxm.midifile to make reading and writing midi files in Python as pythonic, simple and straight forward as possible.

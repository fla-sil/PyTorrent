The format is\npractically dead -- at the time of writing the WDDX specification websites\nwere off-line.  (Indeed, I wrote this module to help retire a legacy\ndata-storage engine written back when WDDX looked like a promising\ninterchange format.)\n\nBelow are the key deficiencies.  I'm not planning on rectifying any of these\nmyself, they are documented here in case anybody else wants to take the module\nover...\n\n\nEncoding Support\n----------------\n\nThe world needs less WDDX packets, not more.  I have resisted the temptation\nto write the missing dump() and dumps() functions, even though it might be\nfun to do so...\n\n\nDate-time Parsing\n-----------------\n\nParsing of date-time values is weak.  WDDX represents date-time values using\nfull ISO 8601 encoding.  This should be decoded using a full ISO 8601 parser,\nnot the fragile datetime.strptime() I used.  There is no such parser in the\nstandard library, and I was loath to bring in an external dependency for\na field I wasn't using.\n\n\nNicities and Details\n--------------------\n\nI've only implemented enough of the WDDX specification to handle all of the\npackets I had.  Partly because that was enough to 'stratch my itch', but\nmostly because I was unable to find a copy of the spec.\n\nFor example, I found a presentation online with a slide that mentions in\npassing that the WDDX string type can contain  control characters in\nstrings, eg. <char code='0C'/>.

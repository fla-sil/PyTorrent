To install clone the repository and use the following command:\n\n\tpip install /path/to/technic-solder-client\n\nVersions are also hosted on PyPi so feel free to use this instead:\n\n\tpip install technic-solder-client\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are many commands available. All commands take a URL to the Solder server. This is denoted by the `solder_url` parameter.\n\n### Server Info\n\nSome times you just need to know some basic information about the Solder Server. You can get this information with the info command. This is done like so:\n\n\tsolder <solder_url> server-info\n\n### Verify\n\nUsed to verify that your API key is valid.\n\n\tsolder <solder_url> verify-api-key <api_key>\n\n### Mods\n\n#### List\n\nGets a list of all available mods.\n\n\tsolder <solder_url> mod list\n\n#### Get\n\nGets information about a specific mod.\n\n\tsolder <solder_url> mod get <mod_slug>\n\nThe `mod_slug` paramter is a URL friendly short name for the mod. This is set by the Solder server.\n\n### Modpacks\n\nThere are a few commands available for modpacks.\n\n#### List\n\nThis command lists off all the public modpacks that are available on the Solder server.\n\n\tsolder <solder_url> modpack list\n\n#### Get\n\nThis command gives some information about the modpack.\n\n\tsolder <solder_url> modpack get <modpack_slug>\n\nThe `modpack_slug` parameter is a URL friendly short name for the modpack. This is set by the Solder server.\n\n#### Build\n\nThis allows you to work with modpack builds.\n\n##### Get\n\nThis command gives you the information on a particular build of a modpack.\n\n\tsolder <solder_url> build <modpack_slug> get <build>\n\n##### Download\n\nThis command downloads a build of the modpack.\n\n\tsolder <solder_url> build <modpack_slug> download <build> [--latest] [--dir DIR] [--upgrade]\n\nThe `build` parameter is optional. If you don't give that the recommended build for the mod is chosen unless you also give the `--latest` flag. If you do that then the latest build is downloaded. If you give the `--dir` flag you can set a specific directory to download to. The default is the current directory. If the `--upgrade` flag is given then the bin, config, and mods directory are cleaned (deleted) before downloading the modpack. This flag does nothing if the directories don't exist.\n\n### Configuration\n\nYou can use a configuration file to change a bit of how the solder client works. This file is by default located in your user home directory as a file named `.solderrc`. The configuration file is JSON formatted.\n\n#### Solder Cache\n\nYou can change the location of your mod cache by setting the `cache` key in the configuration file. This is just a path to a directory.\n\n\t{\n\t\t...snip...\n\t\t\"cache\": \"~/my-solder-cache\"\n\t\t...snip...\n\t}\n\n### Notes\n\nAll of the commands take an optional `--config <config_file>` flag that allows you to give a different configuration file.\n\n### API\n\nThe client uses Python and you are more than welcome to tap into the API that is available for use in other applications.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/cadyyan/technic-solder-client", "keywords": null, "license": "MIT", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "technic-solder-client", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/technic-solder-client/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/technic-solder-client/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/cadyyan/technic-solder-client"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/technic-solder-client/2.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Python implementation of a Technic Solder client", "version": "2.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            # Technic Solder Client for Python<br><br>## Installation<br><br>Installation requires pip installed as well as Python 2.7 or greater.

Create a scatterplot \n2. Plot the distribution of your data\n3. Group or cluster samples in your data\n\n### 1. Creating a scatterplot:\n\nTo create a scatterplot, you have to run the **scattergraph** function from the **plotting.py** file, which takes the following arguments:\n1.  x: this is the column that you want to plot on your x-axis. This should be a numpy array.\n2.  y: this is the column that you want to plot on your y-axis. This should be a numpy array.\n3.  xtitle: this will be the title of your x-axis. This should be a string.\n4.  ytitle: this will be the title of your y-axis. This should be a string.\n5.  graphtitle: this will be the title of your graph. This should be a string.\n6.  outlier_treatment: this tells the graph how to visually differentiate outliers on your plot. You can choose one of the below options. This should be a string.\n-  \"color\": plots the outliers in a different color\n-  \"shape\": plots the outliers with a different marker\n-  \"size\": plots the outliers with a different size\n-  _Note: this argument will default to size if any other string is passed_\n7. outlier_sensitivity: this is a multiplier in a customized IQR calculation, which ultiamately generates a sub-array of outliers. This should be a float (recommended between 0 and 2). If outlier_sensitivity is zero, then your outliers are in the 1st and 4th quartile of your data. The higher the outlier_sensitivity, the fewer the outliers.\n\n### 2. Plotting your distributions:\nTo plot your distribution, you have to run the **plotdistribution** function from the **plotting.py** file, which takes the following arguments:\n1. y: this is the column that has your target data. This should be a numpy array.\n2. numberofbins: choose the number of bins for the histogram. The larger the data set, the more likely you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll want a large number of bins. This should be an int.\n3. plottitle: this will be the title of your graph. This should be a string.\n\n### 3. Grouping/creating clusters:\nTo create clusters, you have to run the **create_clusters** function from the **clustering.py** file, which takes the following arguments:\n1. x: the columns that you want to use as a basis for clustering. This should be a numpy array.\n2. y: this is the column that has your target data. This should be a numpy array.\n3. numberofclusters: the number of clusters to form as well as the number of centroids to generate. This should be an int.\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/claradab/claraw10", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "claraw10", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/claraw10/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/claraw10/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/claradab/claraw10"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/claraw10/0.0.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "A plotting and clustering package", "version": "0.0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h2>This package allows you to:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a scatterplot</li>\n<li>Plot the distribution of your data</li>\n<li>Group or cluster samples in your data</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>1.

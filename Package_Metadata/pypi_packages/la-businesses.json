It also selects\na subset of businesses with operation starting date within the last NDAYS days\n(default 30) and saves this as a separate CSV file. Finally, it creates and \nsaves a KML file from the subset, useful for importing into Google Maps or\nsimilar software to visualize the distribution of recent businesses opened in\nthe Los Angeles area. \n\n\n## Installation\nInstall with pip. The package installs as a command-line script. \n```\npip install la-businesses\n```\n\n## Usage\nRun from the command line (it installs as as script). All downloaded and \ngenerated files will be stored in a directory `files` inside the current \nworking directory.\n```\nusage: la-businesses [-h] [-u] [-d NDAYS]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help              show this help message and exit\n  -u, --update            update data (default: False)\n  -d NDAYS, --days NDAYS  started since NDAYS days ago (default: 30)\n```\n  \n## Known issues\n#### Locations with missing coordinates are omitted from KML file\nThe script relies on coordinate data already provided in the downloaded dataset. \nSome businesses contain addresses but no coordinates; in these cases, the \nbusiness is ignored when creating the KML (but is included in any saved CSV \nfile). Future implementations should include a function to look up location\ncoordinates from a given address (e.g., using the Open Street Maps API). \n\n#### Locations with no DBA name simply show NaN in the KML file\nThe script could use better handling of business name / DBA combinations to \nomit NaN from KML when it does not have a business name. \n\n#### No phone numbers\nThe data does not include any phone or email contact information; merging this\ndataset with one that includes contact information would be more useful for \nmarket research. \n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "Manuel Ochoa", "maintainer_email": "dev@manuelochoa.com", "name": "la-businesses", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/la-businesses/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/la-businesses/", "project_urls": null, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/la-businesses/0.1.1/", "requires_dist": ["requests (>=2.21,<3.0)", "pandas (>=0.24.2,<0.25.0)", "simplekml (>=1.3,<2.0)", "pytz (>=2018.9,<2019.0)"], "requires_python": ">=3.7,<4.0", "summary": "Save the latest database of businesses in Los Angeles as CSV and KML.", "version": "0.1.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>la-businesses</h1>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>This script downloads and processes the listing of all active businesses\ncurrently registered with the City of Los Angeles Office of Finance.\nAn 'active' business is defined as a registered business whose owner has not\nnotified the Office of Finance of a cease of business operations.\nUpdate Interval: Monthly.</p>\n<p>Data source: <a href=\"https://data.lacity.org/A-Prosperous-City/Listing-of-Active-Businesses/6rrh-rzua\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://data.lacity.org/A-Prosperous-City/Listing-of-Active-Businesses/6rrh-rzua</a></p>\n<p>This script fetches the data and saves it locally as a CSV file.

Currently that includes both [Content Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy) (CSP) and [HTTP Public Key Pinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning) (HPKP), but support for additional report types is planned.\n\nBefore getting started you should familiarize yourself with the standards and their potential pitfalls ([especially HPKP](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/be-afraid-of-public-key-pinning/)). The risks can be mitigated significantly by using Django Lookout along with report-only policies, which would still allow you to be notified of potential attacks without the risk of accidentally rendering your web site inaccessible.\n\nIt's important to note that Django Lookout only handles the *reporting* part of the process. Setting the headers which tell browsers what to do, or even where to send reports, is outside its scope. You'll need to set the `report-uri` property for CSP and/or HPKP to point to your Django Lookout endpoint.\n\n\n## Install and Configure\n\n**Notes**\n\n* If you're using HPKP, Django Lookout *has* to be set up on a different domain name.\n\n\n### Step 1\n\n```bash\npip install Django-Lookout \n```\n\nAdd the app to your Django project's `settings.py`:\n\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n\t...\n\t'lookout',\n\t...\n]\n```\n\n\n### Step 2\n\nAdd the API endpoint to `urls.py`.\n\n```python\nurlpatterns = [\n\t...\n\t# Django Lookout\n\turl(r'^reporting', include('lookout.urls')),\n\t...\n]\n```\n\n**Notes**\n\n* You can set the pattern to whatever you want. That's where you'll be pointing `report-uri`.\n* Be mindful of trailing slashes.\n\n\n### Step 3\n\nRun the database migrations:\n\n```bash\n./manage.py migrate lookout\n```\n\n\n## Useful Guides\n\n### Content Security Policy\n\n* [Google Web Fundamentals \u2013 Content Security Policy](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/csp/)\n* [Content Security Policy - An Introduction](https://scotthelme.co.uk/content-security-policy-an-introduction/)\n\n### HTTP Public Key Pinning\n\n* [Google \u2013 Rolling out Public Key Pinning with HPKP Reporting](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/09/HPKP-reporting-with-chrome-46)\n* [Guidance on setting up HPKP](https://scotthelme.co.uk/guidance-on-setting-up-hpkp/)\n\n\n## Standards\n\nSupport for these standards is planned to be implemented in Django Lookout 1.0.\n\n- [Out-of-Band Reporting API](https://wicg.github.io/reporting/) \u2705  \n  A generic incident reporting API that can be used by all of the following standards.

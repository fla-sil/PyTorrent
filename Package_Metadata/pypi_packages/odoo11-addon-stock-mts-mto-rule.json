The virtual stock of the product is 0 \n    => It will act exactly like the make to order route.\n\n2. The virtual stock is equal to the quantity ordered\n    => It will act exactly like a make to stock route\n\n3. The virtual stock is more than 0 but less than ordered quantity\n    => On part of the products will be taken from stock and a purchase order\n       will be created for the rest. So it will act like both make to order and\n       make to stock rule.\n\nExample : \nWe have a virtual stock of : 1 product A\nA sale Order is made for 3 products A.\n2 Procurements will be created : \n\n1. 1 with a make to stock rule and a quantity of 1\n\n2. 1 with a make to order rule and a quantity of 2.\n\nAfter validation, a purchase order with 2 products will be created.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nYou have to select 'Use MTO+MTS rules' on the company's warehouse form.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nYou have to select the mts+mto route on the product form.\nYou should not select both the mts+mto route and the mto route.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/153/11.0\n\nKnown issues\n============\n\nIf you cancel a delivery order and then recreate it from Recreate\nDelivery Order button in sale order form, then the stock level at the time of\nthe Re-Creation won't be taken into account. So if a purchase order was created\nwhen the sale order was first validated, a similar purchase order will be created\nduring the Re-creation of the delivery order, even if not needed regarding the actual stock.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues>`_.

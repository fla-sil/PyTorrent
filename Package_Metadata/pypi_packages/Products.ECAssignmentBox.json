Plone 3.x support has been dropped.\n  Plone 3 users should use ECAssignmentBox 1.4.x.\n\n\n# Changes in release 1.4.3 (2011-04-29)\n\n- Minor improvements.\n\n\n# Changes in release 1.4.2 (2009-09-30)\n\n- ECAssignmentBox is now eggified and uploaded to PyPI.  An old-style \n  tarball distribution is still available at plone.org.\n\n- It's now possible to modify the submission period and other settings \n  for more than one assignment box at a time by using the ``set \n  assignment box options`` action on ECFolder's content tab.\n\n- Fixed issue: Assignments in state superseded can not be accessed by\n  the owner.\n\n- Fixed issue: ECAssignmentBox int argument error.  After a students \n  submission is graded and state changed to Graded an ``TypeError: \n  int argument required`` appears on the statistics tab.\n\n\n# Changes in release 1.4 (2009-02-04)\n\n- ECAssignmentBox was completly re-implemented with support for Plone \n  3.x.\n\n\n# Changes in release 1.3 (2007-06-27)\n\n- ECFolders and assignment boxes now have an *analysis* tab which \n  provides more information about contained assignments, e.g., number\n  of attempts users needed for an assignment or number of submissions \n  per day.\n\n- The *assignments (full)* view (shows the full text of all assignments\n  on one page) is now integrated in the *assignments* tab.\n\n- New content type ECAssignmentTask, which can be used to build a\n  repository of assignments; ECAssignmentTask objects can be\n  referenced from ECAssignmentBoxes.\n\n- If an assignment box is located inside an ECLecture object which\n  requires registration, submissions are only allowed for users\n  enrolled in the course.\n\n\n# Changes in release 1.2 (2007-02-28)\n\n- Added field ``Maximum number of attempts`` to ECAssignmentBox to\n  restrict the number of resubmissions.\n\n- Implemented issue #118: For box owners and managers it is now\n  possible make submissions even if the assignment box is in state\n  ``public draft`` or ``private``, and to make any number of\n  resubmissions.\n\n- In the *assignments* view:\n\n  - If there is more than one assignment box inside an ECFolder one\n    will see a table for each box.  Clicking the check box in one of\n    the tables' header will check or uncheck all entries inside this\n    table only and *not* all entries in all tables.\n\n  - Now it is possible to toggle the view of superseded assignments.\n\n  - Added clickable workflow states (assignments can now be filtered\n    by workflow state).\n\n  - Added delete button and polished the ``change state`` controls.\n\n- As addition to the *assignments* view, owners and managers can use\n  the *assignments (full)* tab to see the full text of all assignments\n  on one page.\n\n- If the parent of an assignment box is an ECFolder and this ECFolder\n  contains directions, the directions will be shown inside a\n  collapsible box on top of the assignment box.\n\n- Fixed issue #119: Uploads can now be any size.\n\n- Fixed issue #120: Students do not see shared assignments of other\n  users in the *statistics* view.\n\n- Performance improvements: We are now using portal_catalog where\n  possible.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://plone.org/products/ecassignmentbox/", "keywords": "", "license": "GPL", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "Products.ECAssignmentBox", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Products.ECAssignmentBox/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Products.ECAssignmentBox/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://plone.org/products/ecassignmentbox/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Products.ECAssignmentBox/1.5.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Creation, submission and grading of online assignments (exercises, homework).", "version": "1.5.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"overview\">\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>ECAssignmentBox is a Plone product which allows the creation,\nsubmission and grading of online assignments (exercises, homework),\nboth for traditional on-site courses and for e-learning.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"download\">\n<h2>Download</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://plone.org/products/ecassignmentbox/\" rel=\"nofollow\">plone.org products page</a></p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"prerequisites\">\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>To use ECAssignmentBox you need a current Plone installation,\nspecifically Plone 4.x.

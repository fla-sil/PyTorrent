{"info": {"author": "Aruba Switching Automation", "author_email": "aruba-switching-automation@hpe.com", "bugtrack_url": null, "classifiers": ["Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "Intended Audience :: System Administrators", "License :: OSI Approved :: Apache Software License", "Programming Language :: Python :: 3 :: Only", "Topic :: System :: Networking"], "description": "# pyaoscx\n\nThese modules are written for AOS-CX API v1 and v10.04. These scripts are written for devices running AOS-CX firmware version 10.04.\n\nFor this initial release, it is recommended to use the v1 AOS-CX API.  See the Release Notes for more information.\n\n## Structure\n\n* REST API call functions are found in the modules in /pyaoscx.\n* REST API call functions are combined into other functions that emulate low-level processes. These low-level process functions are also placed in files in /pyaoscx.\n* Functions from the /pyaoscx files (API functions and low-level functions) are combined to emulate larger network configuration processes (workflows). These workflow scripts stored in the /workflows folder.\n\n## How to contribute\n\nPlease see the accompanying CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on how to contribute to this repository.\n\n## Git Workflow\n\nThis repo adheres to the 'shared repo' git workflow:\n1. Clone the repo to a local machine:\n\n    ```git clone <repo_URL>```\n2. Checkout a local working branch:\n\n    ```git checkout -b <local_working_branch_name>```\n3. Add and amend files in the local working branch:\n\n    ```git add <file_name>```\n4. Commit regularly. Each commit should encompass a single logical change to the repo (e.g. adding a new function in /pyaoscx is one commit; writing docstrings for all functions in a module is another commit). Include an explanatory message with each commit:\n\n    ```git commit -m \"<Clear_explanation_of_commit_here>\"```\n5. Push commits to github.hpe.com:\n\n    ```git push origin <local_working_branch_name>```\n6. Merge changes using a Pull Request on github.hpe.com. Ensure the PR has a relevant title and additional comments if necessary. PRs should be raised regularly once code is tested and the user satisfied that it is ready for submission. Do not put off creaing a PR until a whole project is complete. The larger the PR, the difficult it is to successfully merge.\n\n## Setup\nBefore starting ensure the switch REST API is enabled. Instructions for checking and changing whether or not the REST API is enabled status are available in the *ArubaOS-CX Rest API Guide*. \nThis includes making sure each device has an administrator account with a password, and each device has https-server rest access-mode read-write and enabled on the reachable vrf.\n\n### How to run this code\nIn order to run the workflow scripts, please complete the steps below:\n1. install virtual env (refer https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Make sure python version 3 is installed in system.\n\n    ```\n    $ python3 -m venv switchenv\n    ```\n2. Activate the virtual env\n    ```\n    $ source switchenv/bin/activate\n    in Windows:\n    $ venv/Scripts/activate.bat\n    ```\n3. Install the pyaoscx package\n    ```\n    (switchenv)$ pip install pyaoscx\n    ```  \n4. Now you can run different workflows from pyaoscx/workflows (e.g. `print_system_info.py`) \n5. Keep in mind that the workflows perform high-level configuration processes; they are highly dependent on the configuration already on the switch prior to running the workflows. For this reason, the comment at the top of each workflow script describes any necessary preconditions.\n\n## Troubleshooting Issues\n1. If you encounter module import errors, make sure that the package has been installed correctly.\n\nAdditionally, please read the RELEASE-NOTES.md file for the current release information and known issues.\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/aruba/pyaoscx", "keywords": "networking aruba aos-cx switch rest api python", "license": "Apache 2.0", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "pyaoscx", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyaoscx/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyaoscx/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/aruba/pyaoscx"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyaoscx/0.1.2/", "requires_dist": ["requests", "PyYAML"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "AOS-CX Python Modules", "version": "0.1.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>pyaoscx</h1>\n<p>These modules are written for AOS-CX API v1 and v10.04.

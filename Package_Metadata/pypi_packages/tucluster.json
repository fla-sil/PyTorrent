A model has a name, description and a folder containing all tuflow model input files\n        - POST: Upload a single zip archive containing all model data. TCF files must be in the root directory. Returns a representation of the\n        created model. Alternatively, pass a JSON object with a ``name`` attribute to create a new model without any data\n\n:``/models/{name}``:\n        - GET: Retrieve a representation of single model by its name\n        - PATCH: Update the ``name``, ``description`` and ``email`` (user) of a single model.\n        You may also upload a file to be added to the model data folder\n\n:``/runs``:\n        - GET: Returns a list of all model runs. A model run represents a single execution of a Tuflow model.\n        It has a link to its model, a control file, the name of the tuflow executable and a task id.\n        The task id can be used to query the status of the run. Upon completion the location of the\n        results, log and check folders are available in the model run.\n\n        - POST: Start a tuflow modelling task. A representation of the created model run is returned. POST body should be json containing:\n                - ``tuflowExe`` - the name of the tuflow executable to use for this run\n                - ``modelName`` - the name of the parent model which supplies the input data\n                - ``controlFile`` - the path to the control file to use for this run (taken from the parent model)\n\n:``/runs/{oid}``:\n        - GET: Retrieve a representation of a single model run by its' ID.\n\n:``/tasks/{id}``:\n        - GET: Retrieve the current status of a task by its task_id. A task is a currently-executing model run\n        and the task id can be retrieved from the model run object.\n\n:``/files/{fid}``:\n        - GET: Download a file by its FID. The FID is the url-safe base64 encoding of the file path.\n        Such encodings are returned when retrieving a directory tree representation.\n\n:``/files/tree/{fid}``:\n        - GET: Get a JSON representation of the directory tree structure given by the folder\n        path described by ``fid``. This is a url-safe base64 encoding of a folder path as can be\n        retrieved from a successful task result (for output folders) or a model, which returns the\n        input folder location as a fid.\n\nLicence\n--------\n\nTucluster is free and open source software licensed under GPLv3.\n\n\n=======\nHistory\n=======\n\n0.1.0 (2017-08-03)\n------------------\n\n* First release on PyPI.\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/JamesRamm/tucluster", "keywords": "tucluster", "license": "GNU General Public License v3", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "tucluster", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/tucluster/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/tucluster/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/JamesRamm/tucluster"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/tucluster/0.1.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "HTTP API for managing and running Tuflow models in the cloud", "version": "0.1.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            =========<br>TuCluster<br>=========<br><br>HTTP API for managing and running Anuga and Tuflow models in the cloud or a local HPC cluster.<br><br>.. note:: TuCluster is in early stages of development and not yet ready for production use.<br>        We are working towards a 0.1 release asap!<br><br><br>.. image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/JamesRamm/tucluster.svg<br>        :target: https://travis-ci.org/JamesRamm/tucluster<br><br>.. image:: https://codecov.io/gh/JamesRamm/tucluster/branch/master/graph/badge.svg<br>        :target: https://codecov.io/gh/JamesRamm/tucluster<br><br>.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/tucluster/badge/?version=latest<br>        :target: http://tucluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest<br>        :alt: Documentation Status<br><br>.. image:: https://pyup.io/repos/github/JamesRamm/tucluster/shield.svg<br>     :target: https://pyup.io/repos/github/JamesRamm/tucluster/<br>     :alt: Updates<br><br>Features<br>--------<br><br>- Upload Anuga or Tuflow model data and queue models for execution across multiple workers<br>- Basic validation of (tuflow) control files<br>- Persists model metadata in mongodb allowing management and searching of all your modelling activities<br>- Poll running models for their status<br>- Explore and download result data<br>- Compare modelling engines by creating a single model with runs for both Anuga and Tuflow<br><br>Future<br>------<br>This API is very young and we have many ideas for expanding.

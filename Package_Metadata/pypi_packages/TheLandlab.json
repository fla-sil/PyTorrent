It will also install any required\npackages.\n\nNote that if you are developing landlab you will probably not want to do this!\nIf you do, you would have to run this command everytime you make a change to\nthe code. Instead, you want to install the package in \"development mode\". See\nbelow in the \"Development Environment\" section for details on how to do this.\n\n\n----------------------\nDeveloping The Landlab\n----------------------\n\nThis section describes one possible workflow when developing The Landlab.\n\nUsing Subversion\n================\n\nThe standard resource for Subversion \"Version Control with Subversion\" book.\nIt's available online and is completely *free*!\n\nhttp://svnbook.red-bean.com/\n\n\nCheckout a copy of the source\n-----------------------------\n\nUse Subversion to checkout the latest version of the source code::\n\n    $ svn co https://csdms.colorado.edu/svn/TheLandlab/trunk landlab\n\nAlternatively, if you already have a working copy of the repository you may want\nto update it with changes that others have committed to the repository::\n\n    $ svn update\n\nReview your changes\n-------------------\n\nNow that you've made changes to some files, you'll probably want to have a\nlook at what you've done. To see what it is you've changed since your last\ncommit (or since you last checkout), use the status command::\n\n    $ svn status\n\nUse the Subversion diff command to see the differences between your copy and the\ncopy that you checked out::\n\n    $ svn diff <changed_file>\n\nwhere *<changed_file>* is the name of the file you've made changes to. If you\ndon't list any file names, this command will print the differences for *all*\nfiles that have changes.\n\nCommit your changes to the repository\n-------------------------------------\n\nOnce you have made changes to your copy of the source and are happy with the\nchanges, you can commit them back to the repository::\n\n    $ svn commit\n\nThis will commit all changes that you have made under the current directory. If\nyou only want to commit changes to a file or two, you can list the file names\nseparately on the command line::\n\n    $ svn commit <one_file> <another_file>\n\n\n---------------------------\nThe Development Environment\n---------------------------\n\nOnce I have a working copy of The Landlab source code, I use the pip command to\ninstall a development version of the code. If I'm in the base landlab folder\n(the folder that contains setup.py), I run the following::\n\n    $ pip install -e .\n\nThis sets up python so that it knows where the landlab package is when try to\nimport it - regardless of what directory you are in. This allows python commands\nlike::\n\n    >>> import landlab\n    >>> from landlab import craters\n\nto work. If you didn't do this you might start getting errors that contain \nsomething like::\n\n    ImportError: No module named landlab\n\nTo uninstall your development version of landlab::\n\n    $ pip uninstall TheLandlab\n\n\n------------------\nRunning Unit Tests\n------------------\n\nImmediatly after update your working copy of the code (or checking out a new\nversion) I will normally run the unit tests for the package to make sure nothing\nis broken. You can do this with setup.py::\n\n    $ python setup.py test\n\nYou should also probably do this before commiting changes to the repository to\nmake sure you didn't break things.\n\n\n------------\nCoding Style\n------------\n\nBecause Python is so flexible style-wise, please try to stick to the coding\nstyle described by PEP8,\n\nhttp://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\n\nAn easy way to make sure that you've done this is by running the pep8 command\non each file that you edit. If you don't have pep8 installed, you will have to\ninstall it with::\n\n    $ pip install pep8\n\nNow you can run it on a Python source file. For instance::\n\n    $ pep8 craters.py\n\nAt first, this will probably return lots of problems with you source file. Don't\nworry though, it won't take long to get used to the coding style and be able to\nwrite compatible code straigt away. If we stick to this it will make it much\neasier to read the code written by any one of us.\n\n\n-----------------------\nBuild API Documentation\n-----------------------\n\nYou can build documentation for the LandLab API using Sphinx. Once you have set\nup your envrionment to properly import landlab, you can generate the necessary\nsphinx files with::\n\n    $ python setup.py build_sphinx\n\nThis will put a bunch of files in the docs folder. The HTML documentation will\nbe under the docs/_build/html/ folder. Pointing your browser to index.html\nunder this folder will give you the top-level page for the documentation. This\nentire folder is relocatable, so if you would like your documentation elsewhere\nyou can easily move the folder around.\n\nIf you have added, removed, or renamed files you may need to regenerate some of\nthe sphinx files and rebuild the api docs. If you have Sphinx installed, you can\ndo this with (from the directory that contains setup.py)::\n\n    $ sphinx-apidoc -o docs landlab\n\n\nHappy Landlab-ing!\n==================", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": "https://pythonhosted.org/TheLandlab/", "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://csdms.colorado.edu/trac/landlab", "keywords": null, "license": "UNKNOWN", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "TheLandlab", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/TheLandlab/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/TheLandlab/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://csdms.colorado.edu/trac/landlab"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/TheLandlab/0.1.5/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Plugin-based component modeling tool.", "version": "0.1.5", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <table>\n<col>\n<col>\n<tbody>\n<tr><th>package name:</th><td>TheLandlab</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><th>Version:</th>\n<td>0.1</td></tr>\n<tr><th>release date:</th><td>2013-03-24</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><th>Authors:</th>\n<td>Greg Tucker\n<br>Nicole Gasparini\n<br>Erkan Istanbulluoglu\n<br>Daniel Hobley\n<br>Sai Nudurupati\n<br>Jordan Adams\n<br>Eric Hutton</td></tr>\n<tr><th>url:</th><td><a href=\"http://csdms.colorado.edu/trac/landlab\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://csdms.colorado.edu/trac/landlab</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><th>license:</th><td>MIT</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div id=\"install\">\n<h2>Install</h2>\n<div id=\"installing-a-release\">\n<h3>Installing a release</h3>\n<p>We don\u2019t have any releases of The Landlab yet so this doesn\u2019t work right now.\nHowever, once we have a stable release, this is how users will install our\nsoftware on their machine:</p>\n<pre>$ pip install TheLandlab\n</pre>\n<p>This will install Landlab as well as any prerequisite packages (required packages\nare listed in setup.py).</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"installing-from-a-source-distribution\">\n<h3>Installing from a source distribution</h3>\n<p>To install the landlab package from a source distribution (like what you get with\na Subversion checkout), run the setup.py script with the install argument:</p>\n<pre>$ python setup.py install\n</pre>\n<p>This will put the landlab package into a system-wide location so that you can\nimport landlab from any python session.

This is achieved \r\nnot through re-implementing Python, as Jython/JPython has done, but rather through interfacing at \r\nthe native level in both Virtual Machines.\r\n\r\nEventually, it should be possible to replace Java with python in many, though not all, situations. \r\nJSP, Servlets, RMI servers and IDE plugins are good candidates.\r\n\r\nOnce this integration is achieved, a second phase will be started to separate the Java logic from \r\nthe Python logic, eventually allowing the bridging technology to be used in other environments, \r\nI.E. Ruby, Perl, COM, etc ...\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\nKnown Bugs/Limitations :\r\n\t* Java classes outside of a package (in the <default>) cannot be imported.\r\n\t* unable to access a field or method if it conflicts with a python keyword.\r\n\t* Because of lack of JVM support, you cannot shutdown the JVM and then restart it.\r\n\t* Some methods rely on the \"current\" class/caller. Since calls coming directly from \r\n\t  python code do not have a current class, these methods do not work.

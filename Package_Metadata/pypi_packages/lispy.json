I'd like to learn more\nabout the internal implementation of python, its introspection\nabilities and its design decisions. I'd also like to better understand\nthe LISP ecosystem, what better way than implementing a LISP in\npython.\n\nCurrent Features\n----------------\n\n  - A minimal scheme implementation in Python (based on Peter Norvig's lispy)\n  - A scheme implementation which can call python functions within the same process\n  - The begining of a \"dialect framework\" which will allow customized\n    lisp dialects with changes to the lanage implemented in either\n    python or a lispy dialect\n\nGoals\n-----\n\nThis is currently a pet project to facilitate learning the LISP and\nscheme ecosystems and to bring about a better understanding of the\ntheory and complexity of language design.

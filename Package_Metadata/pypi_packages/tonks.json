{"info": {"author": "Nicole Carlson, Michael Sugimura", "author_email": "", "bugtrack_url": null, "classifiers": [], "description": "![tonks](https://net-shoprunner-scratch-data-science.s3.amazonaws.com/tonks/tonks_v2_hex_transparent.png)\n\n# Tonks\nTonks is a general purpose deep learning library developed by the ShopRunner Data Science team to train multi-task image, text, or ensemble (image + text) models.\n\nWhat differentiates our library is that you can train a multi-task model with different datasets for each of your tasks. For example, you could train one model to label dress length for dresses and pants length for pants.\n\nSee the [docs](https://tonks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details.\n\nTo quickly get started, check out one of our tutorials in the `notebooks` folder. In particular, the `synthetic_data` tutorial provides a very quick example of how the code works.\n\n## Structure\n- `notebooks`\n    - `fashion_data`: a set of notebooks demonstrating training Tonks models on an open source fashion dataset consisting of images and text descriptions\n    - `synthetic_data`: a set of notebooks demonstrating training Tonks models on a set of generated color swatches. This is meant to be an easy fast demo of the library's capabilities that can be run on CPU's.\n- `tonks`\n    - `ensemble`: code for ensemble models of text and vision models\n    - `text`: code for text models with a BERT architecture\n    - `vision`: code for vision models with ResNet50 architectures\n\n## Installation \n```\npip install tonks\n```\n\n## Notes\nCurrently, this library supports ResNet50 and BERT models.\n\nIn some of our documentation the terms `pretrained` and `vanilla` appear. `pretrained` is our shorthand for Tonks models that have been trained at least once already so their weights have been tuned for a specific use case. `vanilla` is our shorthand for base weights coming from `transformers` or `PyTorch` for the out-of-the-box BERT and ResNet50 models.\n\nFor our examples using text models, we use the [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) repository managed by huggingface. The most recent version is called `transformers`. The huggingface repo is the appropriate place to check on BERT documentation and procedures.\n\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nCopyright (c) 2020, ShopRunner\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

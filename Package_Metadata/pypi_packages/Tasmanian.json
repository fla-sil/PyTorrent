Compared to Local polynomial grids, the wavelet basis can provide\n    similar accuracy with significantly fewer points, but the advantage of the Riesz basis could also\n    be negated from the higher Lebesgue constant near the domain boundary.\n* **Fourier grids** use trigonometric functions with varying frequency and rely on Discrete (complex)\n    Fourier Transforms. Such grids are suitable for approximating periodic functions,\n    since periodicity if preserved in the approximation.\n\nDREAM\n--------------\n\nThe DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis is a method to draw samples from an arbitrary probability\ndistribution defined by an arbitrary non-negative function (not necessarily normalized to integrate to 1).\nThe DREAM approach is similar to the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo, but it evolves a large number\nof chains simultaneously which leads to better parallelization and (potentially) faster convergence.\nIn addition, multiple chains allow for better exploration of the probability domain, which is often\nadvantageous when working with multi-modal distributions.\n\nOne of the main applications of DREAM is in the field of Bayesian inference, where samples are drawn\nfrom a posterior distribution comprised from a data-informed likelihood and an arbitrary model.\nThe DREAM module of Tasmanian can use Tasmanian Sparse Grids approximation to either the model\nor the likelihood.\n\n\n### Please cite us\nIf you use Tasmanian for your research, please cite the Manual and our work on global and locally adaptive grids.\n\n[http://tasmanian.ornl.gov/documents/Tasmanian.bib](http://tasmanian.ornl.gov/documents/Tasmanian.bib)\n\n### Quick Install\n Tasmanian supports `--user` install only, see the on-line documentation for details.", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://tasmanian.ornl.gov", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "Tasmanian", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Tasmanian/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Tasmanian/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://tasmanian.ornl.gov"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Tasmanian/7.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "UQ library for sparse grids and Bayesian inference", "version": "7.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Tasmanian</h1>\n<p>The Toolkit for Adaptive Stochastic Modeling and Non-Intrusive ApproximatioN is a collection of robust libraries for high dimensional integration and interpolation as well as parameter calibration.

Alternatively, you can use file capabilities to grant\nextended priviliges to a binary. Unfortunately, this only works on binaries\nand not on scripts, which means you have to set the capability on the\npython binary.\n\n\nHow does it work?\n-----------------\n\nAs mentioned above, you can only set capabilties on a binary. Therefore,\nthis module has a helper binary, which will get the RAW_NET capability.\nThis binary is spawned by the rawsocket python module every time you create\na new raw socket. The helper uses its capability to create the socket and\nthen passes the file descriptor back to the calling program.\n\nIn linux you can pass file descriptors through unix domain sockets by using\nthe ``sendmsg()`` system call and ``SCM_RIGHTS``. See also `fd passing`_.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nUse PIP::\n\n  pip install rawsocket\n\nOr use the standard method::\n\n  python setup.py install\n\nThis will install the extension module and the helper binary. But it will\n*not* set the file capability on the helper binary. You have two choices:\n\n1. Grant every user access to the helper (simple, *not recommended*)::\n\n     setcap cap_net_raw+ep rawsocket-helper\n\n2. Grant access only to users which are member of a specific group\n   (recommended)::\n\n     chmod 750 rawsocket-helper\n     chown root:yourgroup rawsocket-helper\n     setcap cap_net_raw+ep rawsocket-helper\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  import socket, rawsocket\n  fd = rawsocket.rawsocket_fd()\n  s = socket.fromfd(fd, socket.AF_PACKET, socket.SOCK_RAW)\n\nYou see easy as pie ;)\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

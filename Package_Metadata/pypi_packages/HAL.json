It also has a few supplement engines: spam [1]_, one word\n[2]_, and generic.\n\nNote that this is only a library, it doesn't have any fancy interfaces\npre-installed. There are two scripts, ``hal``, which will load command-\nline HAL, and ``whal``, which will load a Tkinter-based GUI for it.\n\n.. [1] detects keyboard spam and notify the user instead of giving\n       an \"I don't understand\" response\n.. [2] *one*-word variant of matrix, designed to run after matrix.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install, do: ``pip install HAL``.\n\nAfter installation, run python in interactive mode and run\n``import HAL.dbtest``. If it says you don't have full-text search, then you\nshould install the ``pysqlite2`` module from `here\n<http://code.google.com/p/pysqlite/downloads/list>`_. If you don't, HAL\nwill still function, albeit much slower.\n\nNote that this is the raw engine, which accepts HAL file extensions to run.\nIf you do not wish to make your own, you can use the dataset we are developing\nthat is located here: http://github.com/HALTeam/HALdata.\n\nTo start HAL, run ``hal``. This will search for data files in the current\ndirectory. Optionally, you can pass the directory where the dataset is as\nan argument to ``hal``.\n\nNote: The dataset is a converted AIML set, that was again converted to the new\nHAL engine from a previous one that only had a regex engine. Because of this,\nand that the entries were separated by a machine, we expect there to be a lot\nof bugs.

Here is a list of some of\nthem (see http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1368855 for a discussion):\n\n- launchd http://launchd.macosforge.org/\n- upstart http://upstart.ubuntu.com/\n- monit http://mmonit.com/monit/\n- supervisord http://supervisord.org/\n- daemontools http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html\n- daemonize http://bmc.github.com/daemonize/\n- runit http://smarden.sunsite.dk/runit/\n- perp http://b0llix.net/perp/\n\nFor production systems, I recommend using a tool like one of these.  I have\nused supervisord and monit before.  Some of these tools work with daemons, like\nmonit, in which case daemoncmd could come in handy.  Other tools, like\nsupervisord, can supervise your process in such a way that you do not need to\ndaemonize it.\n\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf this project does not do what you want, please open an issue or a pull\nrequest on github, https://github.com/todddeluca/daemoncmd.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Probably Python 2.7 (since that is the only version it has been tested with.)\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install from pypi.python.org\n\nDownload and install daemoncmd:\n\n    pip install daemoncmd\n\n### Install from github.com\n\nClone and install daemoncmd:\n\n    git clone git@github.com:todddeluca/daemoncmd.git\n    cd daemoncmd\n    python setup.py install\n\n\n## Usage\n\nThis module has two separate uses cases: \n    \n- running a command as a daemon process\n- forking the current python process as a daemon.\n\nDaemonizing a command allows one to start, stop, and restart a non-daemon\ncommand as a daemon process.  This requires specifying a pid file which is used\nto interact with the process.\n\nUsage examples:\n\n     daemoncmd start --pidfile /tmp/daemon.pid \\\n            --stdout /tmp/daemon.log --stderr /tmp/daemon.log sleep 100\n     daemoncmd restart --pidfile /tmp/daemon.pid \\\n            --stdout /tmp/daemon.log --stderr /tmp/daemon.log sleep 100\n     daemoncmd status --pidfile /tmp/daemon.pid\n     daemoncmd stop --pidfile /tmp/daemon.pid\n\nAnother use case is forking the current process into a daemon.  According\nto pep 3143, forking as a daemon might be done by the standard library some\nday.\n\nUsage example:\n\n    import daemoncmd\n    import mytask\n\n    daemoncmd.daemonize()\n    mytask.doit()\n\nOr from the command line:\n\n    python -c 'import daemoncmd, mytask; daemoncmd.daemonize(); mytask.doit()'\n\nOther usage notes:\n\n- The command should not daemonize itself, since that is what this script does\n  and it would make the pid in the pidfile incorrect.\n- The command should refer to the absolute path of the executable, since\n  daemonization sets the current working directory (cwd) to '/'.  More\n  generally, do not assume what the cwd is.\n- If daemoncmd is run by monit, etc., PATH and other env vars might be\n  restricted for security reasons.\n- daemoncmd does not try to run the daemon as a particular uid.  That would\n  be handled by a process manager like monit, launchd, init, god, etc.\n- When running under monit, etc., pass environment variables to the command\n  like so:\n\n        FOO=testing daemoncmd start --pidfile /tmp/daemon.pid \\\n            --stdout /tmp/daemon.log printenv FOO\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/todddeluca/daemoncmd", "keywords": "daemon python cli init nohup commandline executable script pidfile", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "daemonpy3", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/daemonpy3/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/daemonpy3/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/todddeluca/daemoncmd"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/daemonpy3/1.0.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Turn any command line into a daemon with a pidfile", "version": "1.0.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <br>## Introduction<br><br>My first introduction to running a command as a daemon looked like this:<br><br>    nohup mycommand --myoption myarg &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null &amp;<br><br>While this is a good for doing some development work, a proper daemon requires<br>quite a number of other things to happen.

Two events\nwhich are either side of midnight will never be combined into a\nsingle activity sequence. If there are log events associated with\nthe same contributor in different timezones, these will be treated\nas if they were from different contributors (for example the\nexample report above shows the effect of a commit which occurred\non 2016-09-11 at bitbucket.org, and had a different timezone\nfrom other commits which happened on the same day on a local git\nrepository on my workstation).\n\nMotivations for this project\n----------------------------\n\nOriginally, this script was a side-project of a side-project.\nI wanted to write a presentation about some work I was doing\nand I wanted to give the audience as sense of how much of my\npersonal time had been invested to date.\n\nAs I worked on the script, I discovered that it was a nice\nsmall scope problem which was a good showcase for some of the\npractices the earlier side-project was intended to help me\nexplore:\n\n-  measuring code coverage achieved by my unit tests;\n-  using pylint to train myself to conform to the PEP-8 coding\n   style recommendations for Python;\n-  implementing continuous integration using Jenkins.\n\nAs of the current HEAD state, code coverage is at or near 100%.\n\nFrom my point of view at the moment, the following tasks\nremain to be done:\n\n-  implement continuous integraton using Jenkins;\n-  package and publish the library via PyPi and \n   resolve any bug reports I receive against the \n   existing scope of behaviour.\n\nI am using the bitbucket issue tracking feature to\nmaintain a backlog for the project. See the up-to-date\nlist `here`_\n\nI have no ambition for this project to grow beyond the\nsize required to complete the tasks above. My hope\nand expectation is that it will never contain more than\n1000 lines of code (excluding test data).\n\nContribution Guidelines\n-----------------------\n\nThis work is licensed under `the MIT License`_.\n\nThe license permits you to copy the source, and work with it in \nwhatever way you like, providing credit is given for whatever remains \nof my own work in your product.\n\nThe development/test  environment for the project requires an installation \nof Python 2 or 3 (preferably 3.5) with PyLint and the coverage module \ninstalled.

Pretty\nmuch all I've ever wanted out of a music player was one that played random\nalbums by picking a random artist, then picking a random album, then playing\nthat album, then picking another random artist.\n\nFor some reason,I've never run into a music player that played random albums\nthat way, which led to me often ending up having to skip past multiple albums by\na particular artist, especially when the artist has a large discography.\n\nWhile I call this player minimalist, that's not set in stone -- I'll probably\nadd last.fm scrobbling capability and other various features. These features\nwill, however, be ones that I find useful. I highly doubt this app will ever be\nincredibly bloated.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n------------\n\nPyrana WILL NOT WORK if you do not install what is outlined below.\n\nYou'll need PyGTK, available from http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html . (last\nversion I teseted on was 2.22 ) Its setup.py throws a big old warning if you try\nto install it via setuputils, and I've never actually had it successfully\ninstall that way. On the plus side, your package manager probably provides a\npackage, if it's not already on your system.\n\nYou'll also need to install python-notify >= 1.1, available from\nhttp://www.galago-project.org/files/releases/source/notify-python/ . I'll\nprobably try to move away from this dependency in the near future.\n\nALSO, you'll need to install gst-python >= 0.10.0, available from\nhttp://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-python/ . This is another dependency\nI'll be most likely removing at some point...\n\nYour music directory has to be arranged in a artist/album heirarchy. Something like:\n\nmusic/\n  Underpowered Umpires/\n    Third Strike/\n  Robby and the Revoltors/\n    William S. Burroughs Was My Father/\n\nCONFIGURING\n-----------\n\nPyrana stores its configuration in ~/.pyrana/pyrana.cfg. It currently accepts 3\noptions:\n\nuse_notify :: whether or not to use libnotify to pop up little messages about\nwhat's playing, defaults to True\n\nmusic_dir :: where your music is located, defaults to ~/music\n\nseen_file :: where to store the file containing hashes of seen songs\n\nupdate_pidgin_status :: whether you want Pyrana to update your pidgin status for\nyou when a track updates, defaults to True\n\nCREDIT\n------\n\nCredit is due to Shel from http://kipdreaming.com for the sweet tray\nicons.

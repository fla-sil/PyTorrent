The line inside the box represents the 2nd quartile, \nwhich is the median.\n\nThe interquartile range, which gives this method of outlier detection its name, is the range between the first and the third quartiles (the edges of the box). \nTukey considered any data point that fell outside of either 1.5 times the IQR below the first \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or 1.5 times the IQR above the third \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quartile to be outside or far out. \nIn a classic box-and-whisker plot, the 'whiskers' extend up to the last data point that is not outside.\n\n\n\n## **How to use this package:**\n\nIt take in the dataset csv file and outputs out a csv file in the rows having outlier values are removed. This package handles univariate datasets as well as multivariate. \nEach feature having outlier rows are removed.\n\n### **Installation**\n\nThe package can be installed using the following command in anaconda/command prompt.\n\n~~~\npip install outlier-removal_3054\n~~~\n\n### **Usage**\n\nThe package can be used for outlier removal by providing dataset.\n\n~~~\nremove-outlier <dataset>\n~~~\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "outlier-removal3054", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/outlier-removal3054/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/outlier-removal3054/", "project_urls": null, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/outlier-removal3054/3.1.2/", "requires_dist": ["pandas", "numpy"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "A Python package for removing outliers in dataset using the Interquartile Range technique.", "version": "3.1.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1><strong>OUTLIER REMOVAL USING IQR METHOD</strong></h1>\n<h3>Author : <strong>Mehak Garg</strong></h3>\n<h2><strong>What are outliers?</strong></h2>\n<p>An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population.\nIn a sense, this definition leaves it up to the analyst (or a consensus process) to decide what will be considered abnormal.\nBefore abnormal observations can be singled out, it is necessary to characterize normal observations.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is IQR method?</strong></h2>\n<p>A robust method for labelling outliers is the IQR (interquartile range) method of outlier detection developed by John Tukey, the pioneer of exploratory data analysis.\nThis was in the days of calculation and plotting by hand, so the datasets involved were typically small, and the emphasis was on understanding the story the data told.\nA box-and-whisker plot (also a Tukey contribution), shows this method in action.</p>\n<p>A box-and-whisker plot uses quartiles (points that divide the data into four groups of equal size) to plot the shape of the data.\nThe box represents the 1st and 3rd quartiles, which are equal to the 25th and 75th percentiles.

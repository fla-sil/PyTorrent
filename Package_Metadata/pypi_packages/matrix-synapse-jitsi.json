The basics you need to know to get up and running are:\n\n- Everything in Matrix happens in a room.  Rooms are distributed and do not\n  exist on any single server.  Rooms can be located using convenience aliases\n  like ``#matrix:matrix.org`` or ``#test:localhost:8448``.\n\n- Matrix user IDs look like ``@matthew:matrix.org`` (although in the future\n  you will normally refer to yourself and others using a third party identifier\n  (3PID): email address, phone number, etc rather than manipulating Matrix user IDs)\n\nThe overall architecture is::\n\n      client <----> homeserver <=====================> homeserver <----> client\n             https://somewhere.org/_matrix      https://elsewhere.net/_matrix\n\n``#matrix:matrix.org`` is the official support room for Matrix, and can be\naccessed by any client from https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html or\nvia IRC bridge at irc://irc.freenode.net/matrix.\n\nSynapse is currently in rapid development, but as of version 0.5 we believe it\nis sufficiently stable to be run as an internet-facing service for real usage!\n\nAbout Matrix\n============\n\nMatrix specifies a set of pragmatic RESTful HTTP JSON APIs as an open standard,\nwhich handle:\n\n- Creating and managing fully distributed chat rooms with no\n  single points of control or failure\n- Eventually-consistent cryptographically secure synchronisation of room\n  state across a global open network of federated servers and services\n- Sending and receiving extensible messages in a room with (optional)\n  end-to-end encryption[1]\n- Inviting, joining, leaving, kicking, banning room members\n- Managing user accounts (registration, login, logout)\n- Using 3rd Party IDs (3PIDs) such as email addresses, phone numbers,\n  Facebook accounts to authenticate, identify and discover users on Matrix.\n- Placing 1:1 VoIP and Video calls\n\nThese APIs are intended to be implemented on a wide range of servers, services\nand clients, letting developers build messaging and VoIP functionality on top\nof the entirely open Matrix ecosystem rather than using closed or proprietary\nsolutions. The hope is for Matrix to act as the building blocks for a new\ngeneration of fully open and interoperable messaging and VoIP apps for the\ninternet.\n\nSynapse is a reference \"homeserver\" implementation of Matrix from the core\ndevelopment team at matrix.org, written in Python/Twisted.  It is intended to\nshowcase the concept of Matrix and let folks see the spec in the context of a\ncodebase and let you run your own homeserver and generally help bootstrap the\necosystem.\n\nIn Matrix, every user runs one or more Matrix clients, which connect through to\na Matrix homeserver. The homeserver stores all their personal chat history and\nuser account information - much as a mail client connects through to an\nIMAP/SMTP server. Just like email, you can either run your own Matrix\nhomeserver and control and own your own communications and history or use one\nhosted by someone else (e.g. matrix.org) - there is no single point of control\nor mandatory service provider in Matrix, unlike WhatsApp, Facebook, Hangouts,\netc.\n\nWe'd like to invite you to join #matrix:matrix.org (via\nhttps://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html), run a homeserver, take a look\nat the `Matrix spec <https://matrix.org/docs/spec>`_, and experiment with the\n`APIs <https://matrix.org/docs/api>`_ and `Client SDKs\n<https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html#client-sdks>`_.\n\nThanks for using Matrix!\n\n[1] End-to-end encryption is currently in beta: `blog post <https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last>`_.\n\n\nSynapse Installation\n====================\n\n.. _federation:\n\n* For details on how to install synapse, see `<INSTALL.md>`_.\n* For specific details on how to configure Synapse for federation see `docs/federate.md <docs/federate.md>`_\n\n\nConnecting to Synapse from a client\n===================================\n\nThe easiest way to try out your new Synapse installation is by connecting to it\nfrom a web client.\n\nUnless you are running a test instance of Synapse on your local machine, in\ngeneral, you will need to enable TLS support before you can successfully\nconnect from a client: see `<INSTALL.md#tls-certificates>`_.\n\nAn easy way to get started is to login or register via Riot at\nhttps://riot.im/app/#/login or https://riot.im/app/#/register respectively.\nYou will need to change the server you are logging into from ``matrix.org``\nand instead specify a Homeserver URL of ``https://<server_name>:8448``\n(or just ``https://<server_name>`` if you are using a reverse proxy).\n(Leave the identity server as the default - see `Identity servers`_.)\nIf you prefer to use another client, refer to our\n`client breakdown <https://matrix.org/docs/projects/clients-matrix>`_.\n\nIf all goes well you should at least be able to log in, create a room, and\nstart sending messages.\n\n.. _`client-user-reg`:\n\nRegistering a new user from a client\n------------------------------------\n\nBy default, registration of new users via Matrix clients is disabled. To enable\nit, specify ``enable_registration: true`` in ``homeserver.yaml``. (It is then\nrecommended to also set up CAPTCHA - see `<docs/CAPTCHA_SETUP.md>`_.)\n\nOnce ``enable_registration`` is set to ``true``, it is possible to register a\nuser via `riot.im <https://riot.im/app/#/register>`_ or other Matrix clients.\n\nYour new user name will be formed partly from the ``server_name``, and partly\nfrom a localpart you specify when you create the account. Your name will take\nthe form of::\n\n    @localpart:my.domain.name\n\n(pronounced \"at localpart on my dot domain dot name\").\n\nAs when logging in, you will need to specify a \"Custom server\".  Specify your\ndesired ``localpart`` in the 'User name' box.\n\nACME setup\n==========\n\nFor details on having Synapse manage your federation TLS certificates\nautomatically, please see `<docs/ACME.md>`_.\n\n\nSecurity Note\n=============\n\nMatrix serves raw user generated data in some APIs - specifically the `content\nrepository endpoints <https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest.html#get-matrix-media-r0-download-servername-mediaid>`_.\n\nWhilst we have tried to mitigate against possible XSS attacks (e.g.\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/1021) we recommend running\nmatrix homeservers on a dedicated domain name, to limit any malicious user generated\ncontent served to web browsers a matrix API from being able to attack webapps hosted\non the same domain.  This is particularly true of sharing a matrix webclient and\nserver on the same domain.\n\nSee https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/1977 and\nhttps://developer.github.com/changes/2014-04-25-user-content-security for more details.\n\n\nUpgrading an existing Synapse\n=============================\n\nThe instructions for upgrading synapse are in `UPGRADE.rst`_.\nPlease check these instructions as upgrading may require extra steps for some\nversions of synapse.\n\n.. _UPGRADE.rst: UPGRADE.rst\n\n\nUsing PostgreSQL\n================\n\nSynapse offers two database engines:\n * `SQLite <https://sqlite.org/>`_\n * `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org>`_\n\nBy default Synapse uses SQLite in and doing so trades performance for convenience.\nSQLite is only recommended in Synapse for testing purposes or for servers with\nlight workloads.\n\nAlmost all installations should opt to use PostreSQL. Advantages include:\n\n* significant performance improvements due to the superior threading and\n  caching model, smarter query optimiser\n* allowing the DB to be run on separate hardware\n* allowing basic active/backup high-availability with a \"hot spare\" synapse\n  pointing at the same DB master, as well as enabling DB replication in\n  synapse itself.\n\nFor information on how to install and use PostgreSQL, please see\n`docs/postgres.md <docs/postgres.md>`_.\n\n.. _reverse-proxy:\n\nUsing a reverse proxy with Synapse\n==================================\n\nIt is recommended to put a reverse proxy such as\n`nginx <https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html>`_,\n`Apache <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy_http.html>`_,\n`Caddy <https://caddyserver.com/docs/proxy>`_ or\n`HAProxy <https://www.haproxy.org/>`_ in front of Synapse. One advantage of\ndoing so is that it means that you can expose the default https port (443) to\nMatrix clients without needing to run Synapse with root privileges.\n\nFor information on configuring one, see `<docs/reverse_proxy.md>`_.\n\nIdentity Servers\n================\n\nIdentity servers have the job of mapping email addresses and other 3rd Party\nIDs (3PIDs) to Matrix user IDs, as well as verifying the ownership of 3PIDs\nbefore creating that mapping.\n\n**They are not where accounts or credentials are stored - these live on home\nservers. Identity Servers are just for mapping 3rd party IDs to matrix IDs.**\n\nThis process is very security-sensitive, as there is obvious risk of spam if it\nis too easy to sign up for Matrix accounts or harvest 3PID data. In the longer\nterm, we hope to create a decentralised system to manage it (`matrix-doc #712\n<https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/712>`_), but in the meantime,\nthe role of managing trusted identity in the Matrix ecosystem is farmed out to\na cluster of known trusted ecosystem partners, who run 'Matrix Identity\nServers' such as `Sydent <https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent>`_, whose role\nis purely to authenticate and track 3PID logins and publish end-user public\nkeys.\n\nYou can host your own copy of Sydent, but this will prevent you reaching other\nusers in the Matrix ecosystem via their email address, and prevent them finding\nyou. We therefore recommend that you use one of the centralised identity servers\nat ``https://matrix.org`` or ``https://vector.im`` for now.\n\nTo reiterate: the Identity server will only be used if you choose to associate\nan email address with your account, or send an invite to another user via their\nemail address.\n\n\nPassword reset\n==============\n\nIf a user has registered an email address to their account using an identity\nserver, they can request a password-reset token via clients such as Riot.\n\nA manual password reset can be done via direct database access as follows.\n\nFirst calculate the hash of the new password::\n\n    $ ~/synapse/env/bin/hash_password\n    Password:\n    Confirm password:\n    $2a$12$xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nThen update the `users` table in the database::\n\n    UPDATE users SET password_hash='$2a$12$xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'\n        WHERE name='@test:test.com';\n\n\nSynapse Development\n===================\n\nBefore setting up a development environment for synapse, make sure you have the\nsystem dependencies (such as the python header files) installed - see\n`Installing from source <INSTALL.md#installing-from-source>`_.\n\nTo check out a synapse for development, clone the git repo into a working\ndirectory of your choice::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse.git\n    cd synapse\n\nSynapse has a number of external dependencies, that are easiest\nto install using pip and a virtualenv::\n\n    virtualenv -p python3 env\n    source env/bin/activate\n    python -m pip install --no-use-pep517 -e .[all]\n\nThis will run a process of downloading and installing all the needed\ndependencies into a virtual env.\n\nOnce this is done, you may wish to run Synapse's unit tests, to\ncheck that everything is installed as it should be::\n\n    python -m twisted.trial tests\n\nThis should end with a 'PASSED' result::\n\n    Ran 143 tests in 0.601s\n\n    PASSED (successes=143)\n\nRunning the Integration Tests\n=============================\n\nSynapse is accompanied by `SyTest <https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest>`_,\na Matrix homeserver integration testing suite, which uses HTTP requests to\naccess the API as a Matrix client would. It is able to run Synapse directly from\nthe source tree, so installation of the server is not required.\n\nTesting with SyTest is recommended for verifying that changes related to the\nClient-Server API are functioning correctly. See the `installation instructions\n<https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest#installing>`_ for details.\n\nBuilding Internal API Documentation\n===================================\n\nBefore building internal API documentation install sphinx and\nsphinxcontrib-napoleon::\n\n    pip install sphinx\n    pip install sphinxcontrib-napoleon\n\nBuilding internal API documentation::\n\n    python setup.py build_sphinx\n\nTroubleshooting\n===============\n\nRunning out of File Handles\n---------------------------\n\nIf synapse runs out of file handles, it typically fails badly - live-locking\nat 100% CPU, and/or failing to accept new TCP connections (blocking the\nconnecting client).  Matrix currently can legitimately use a lot of file handles,\nthanks to busy rooms like #matrix:matrix.org containing hundreds of participating\nservers.  The first time a server talks in a room it will try to connect\nsimultaneously to all participating servers, which could exhaust the available\nfile descriptors between DNS queries & HTTPS sockets, especially if DNS is slow\nto respond. (We need to improve the routing algorithm used to be better than\nfull mesh, but as of March 2019 this hasn't happened yet).\n\nIf you hit this failure mode, we recommend increasing the maximum number of\nopen file handles to be at least 4096 (assuming a default of 1024 or 256).\nThis is typically done by editing ``/etc/security/limits.conf``\n\nSeparately, Synapse may leak file handles if inbound HTTP requests get stuck\nduring processing - e.g. blocked behind a lock or talking to a remote server etc.\nThis is best diagnosed by matching up the 'Received request' and 'Processed request'\nlog lines and looking for any 'Processed request' lines which take more than\na few seconds to execute. Please let us know at #synapse:matrix.org if\nyou see this failure mode so we can help debug it, however.\n\nHelp!! Synapse is slow and eats all my RAM/CPU!\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, ensure you are running the latest version of Synapse, using Python 3\nwith a PostgreSQL database.\n\nSynapse's architecture is quite RAM hungry currently - we deliberately\ncache a lot of recent room data and metadata in RAM in order to speed up\ncommon requests. We'll improve this in the future, but for now the easiest\nway to either reduce the RAM usage (at the risk of slowing things down)\nis to set the almost-undocumented ``SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR`` environment\nvariable. The default is 0.5, which can be decreased to reduce RAM usage\nin memory constrained enviroments, or increased if performance starts to\ndegrade.\n\nHowever, degraded performance due to a low cache factor, common on\nmachines with slow disks, often leads to explosions in memory use due\nbacklogged requests. In this case, reducing the cache factor will make\nthings worse. Instead, try increasing it drastically. 2.0 is a good\nstarting value.\n\nUsing `libjemalloc <http://jemalloc.net/>`_ can also yield a significant\nimprovement in overall memory use, and especially in terms of giving back\nRAM to the OS. To use it, the library must simply be put in the\nLD_PRELOAD environment variable when launching Synapse. On Debian, this\ncan be done by installing the ``libjemalloc1`` package and adding this\nline to ``/etc/default/matrix-synapse``::\n\n    LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so.1\n\nThis can make a significant difference on Python 2.7 - it's unclear how\nmuch of an improvement it provides on Python 3.x.\n\nIf you're encountering high CPU use by the Synapse process itself, you\nmay be affected by a bug with presence tracking that leads to a\nmassive excess of outgoing federation requests (see `discussion\n<https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3971>`_). If metrics\nindicate that your server is also issuing far more outgoing federation\nrequests than can be accounted for by your users' activity, this is a\nlikely cause. The misbehavior can be worked around by setting\n``use_presence: false`` in the Synapse config file.\n\nPeople can't accept room invitations from me\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe typical failure mode here is that you send an invitation to someone \nto join a room or direct chat, but when they go to accept it, they get an\nerror (typically along the lines of \"Invalid signature\"). They might see\nsomething like the following in their logs::\n\n    2019-09-11 19:32:04,271 - synapse.federation.transport.server - 288 - WARNING - GET-11752 - authenticate_request failed: 401: Invalid signature for server <server> with key ed25519:a_EqML: Unable to verify signature for <server>\n\nThis is normally caused by a misconfiguration in your reverse-proxy. See\n`<docs/reverse_proxy.md>`_ and double-check that your settings are correct.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "matrix-synapse-jitsi", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/matrix-synapse-jitsi/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/matrix-synapse-jitsi/", "project_urls": null, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/matrix-synapse-jitsi/1.9.1.2/", "requires_dist": ["jsonschema (>=2.5.1)", "frozendict (>=1)", "unpaddedbase64 (>=1.1.0)", "canonicaljson (>=1.1.3)", "signedjson (>=1.0.0)", "pynacl (>=1.2.1)", "idna (>=2.5)", "service-identity (>=18.1.0)", "Twisted (>=18.9.0)", "treq (>=15.1)", "pyopenssl (>=16.0.0)", "pyyaml (>=3.11)", "pyasn1 (>=0.1.9)", "pyasn1-modules (>=0.0.7)", "daemonize (>=2.3.1)", "bcrypt (>=3.1.0)", "pillow (>=4.3.0)", "sortedcontainers (>=1.4.4)", "pymacaroons (>=0.13.0)", "msgpack (>=0.5.2)", "phonenumbers (>=8.2.0)", "six (>=1.10)", "prometheus-client (<0.8.0,>=0.0.18)", "attrs (>=17.4.0)", "netaddr (>=0.7.18)", "Jinja2 (>=2.9)", "bleach (>=1.4.3)", "typing-extensions (>=3.7.4)", "pyjwt (>=1.6.4)", "txacme (>=0.9.2) ; extra == 'acme'", "eliot (<1.8.0) ; (python_version < \"3.5.3\") and extra == 'acme'", "jaeger-client (>=4.0.0) ; extra == 'all'", "lxml (>=3.5.0) ; extra == 'all'", "txacme (>=0.9.2) ; extra == 'all'", "parameterized ; extra == 'all'", "mock (>=2.0) ; extra == 'all'", "psycopg2 (>=2.7) ; extra == 'all'", "Jinja2 (>=2.9) ; extra == 'all'", "opentracing (>=2.2.0) ; extra == 'all'", "pysaml2 (>=4.5.0) ; extra == 'all'", "sentry-sdk (>=0.7.2) ; extra == 'all'", "matrix-synapse-ldap3 (>=0.1) ; extra == 'all'", "eliot (<1.8.0) ; (python_version < \"3.5.3\") and extra == 'all'", "matrix-synapse-ldap3 (>=0.1) ; extra == 'matrix_synapse_ldap3'", "jaeger-client (>=4.0.0) ; extra == 'opentracing'", "opentracing (>=2.2.0) ; extra == 'opentracing'", "psycopg2 (>=2.7) ; extra == 'postgres'", "Jinja2 (>=2.9) ; extra == 'resources.consent'", "pysaml2 (>=4.5.0) ; extra == 'saml2'", "sentry-sdk (>=0.7.2) ; extra == 'sentry'", "systemd-python (>=231) ; extra == 'systemd'", "mock (>=2.0) ; extra == 'test'", "parameterized ; extra == 'test'", "lxml (>=3.5.0) ; extra == 'url_preview'"], "requires_python": "~=3.5", "summary": "Reference homeserver for the Matrix decentralised comms protocol", "version": "1.9.1.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"contents\">\n<p>Contents</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\" id=\"id2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Introduction</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#about-matrix\" id=\"id3\" rel=\"nofollow\">About Matrix</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#synapse-installation\" id=\"id4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Synapse Installation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#connecting-to-synapse-from-a-client\" id=\"id5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Connecting to Synapse from a client</a><ul>\n<li><a href=\"#registering-a-new-user-from-a-client\" id=\"id6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Registering a new user from a client</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#acme-setup\" id=\"id7\" rel=\"nofollow\">ACME setup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#security-note\" id=\"id8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Security Note</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#upgrading-an-existing-synapse\" id=\"id9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upgrading an existing Synapse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#using-postgresql\" id=\"id10\" rel=\"nofollow\">Using PostgreSQL</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#using-a-reverse-proxy-with-synapse\" id=\"id11\" rel=\"nofollow\">Using a reverse proxy with Synapse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#identity-servers\" id=\"id12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Identity Servers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#password-reset\" id=\"id13\" rel=\"nofollow\">Password reset</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#synapse-development\" id=\"id14\" rel=\"nofollow\">Synapse Development</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#running-the-integration-tests\" id=\"id15\" rel=\"nofollow\">Running the Integration Tests</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#building-internal-api-documentation\" id=\"id16\" rel=\"nofollow\">Building Internal API Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#troubleshooting\" id=\"id17\" rel=\"nofollow\">Troubleshooting</a><ul>\n<li><a href=\"#running-out-of-file-handles\" id=\"id18\" rel=\"nofollow\">Running out of File Handles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#help-synapse-is-slow-and-eats-all-my-ram-cpu\" id=\"id19\" rel=\"nofollow\">Help!!

Just like email, you can either run your own Matrix\nhomeserver and control and own your own communications and history or use one\nhosted by someone else (e.g. matrix.org) - there is no single point of control\nor mandatory service provider in Matrix, unlike WhatsApp, Facebook, Hangouts,\netc.</p>\n<p>We\u2019d like to invite you to join #matrix:matrix.org (via\n<a href=\"https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html</a>), run a homeserver, take a look\nat the <a href=\"https://matrix.org/docs/spec\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matrix spec</a>, and experiment with the\n<a href=\"https://matrix.org/docs/api\" rel=\"nofollow\">APIs</a> and <a href=\"https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html#client-sdks\" rel=\"nofollow\">Client SDKs</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks for using Matrix!</p>\n<p>[1] End-to-end encryption is currently in beta: <a href=\"https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"synapse-installation\">\n<h2><a href=\"#id4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Synapse Installation</a></h2>\n<ul id=\"federation\">\n<li>For details on how to install synapse, see <a href=\"INSTALL.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">INSTALL.md</a>.</li>\n<li>For specific details on how to configure Synapse for federation see <a href=\"docs/federate.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">docs/federate.md</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"connecting-to-synapse-from-a-client\">\n<h2><a href=\"#id5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Connecting to Synapse from a client</a></h2>\n<p>The easiest way to try out your new Synapse installation is by connecting to it\nfrom a web client.</p>\n<p>Unless you are running a test instance of Synapse on your local machine, in\ngeneral, you will need to enable TLS support before you can successfully\nconnect from a client: see <a href=\"INSTALL.md#tls-certificates\" rel=\"nofollow\">INSTALL.md#tls-certificates</a>.</p>\n<p>An easy way to get started is to login or register via Riot at\n<a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/login\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://riot.im/app/#/login</a> or <a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/register\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://riot.im/app/#/register</a> respectively.\nYou will need to change the server you are logging into from <tt>matrix.org</tt>\nand instead specify a Homeserver URL of <tt><span class=\"pre\">https://&lt;server_name&gt;:8448</span></tt>\n(or just <tt><span class=\"pre\">https://&lt;server_name&gt;</span></tt> if you are using a reverse proxy).\n(Leave the identity server as the default - see <a href=\"#identity-servers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Identity servers</a>.)\nIf you prefer to use another client, refer to our\n<a href=\"https://matrix.org/docs/projects/clients-matrix\" rel=\"nofollow\">client breakdown</a>.</p>\n<p>If all goes well you should at least be able to log in, create a room, and\nstart sending messages.</p>\n<div id=\"registering-a-new-user-from-a-client\">\n<span id=\"client-user-reg\"></span><h3><a href=\"#id6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Registering a new user from a client</a></h3>\n<p>By default, registration of new users via Matrix clients is disabled.

Matrix currently can legitimately use a lot of file handles,\nthanks to busy rooms like #matrix:matrix.org containing hundreds of participating\nservers.  The first time a server talks in a room it will try to connect\nsimultaneously to all participating servers, which could exhaust the available\nfile descriptors between DNS queries &amp; HTTPS sockets, especially if DNS is slow\nto respond. (We need to improve the routing algorithm used to be better than\nfull mesh, but as of March 2019 this hasn\u2019t happened yet).</p>\n<p>If you hit this failure mode, we recommend increasing the maximum number of\nopen file handles to be at least 4096 (assuming a default of 1024 or 256).\nThis is typically done by editing <tt>/etc/security/limits.conf</tt></p>\n<p>Separately, Synapse may leak file handles if inbound HTTP requests get stuck\nduring processing - e.g. blocked behind a lock or talking to a remote server etc.\nThis is best diagnosed by matching up the \u2018Received request\u2019 and \u2018Processed request\u2019\nlog lines and looking for any \u2018Processed request\u2019 lines which take more than\na few seconds to execute. Please let us know at #synapse:matrix.org if\nyou see this failure mode so we can help debug it, however.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"help-synapse-is-slow-and-eats-all-my-ram-cpu\">\n<h3><a href=\"#id19\" rel=\"nofollow\">Help!! Synapse is slow and eats all my RAM/CPU!</a></h3>\n<p>First, ensure you are running the latest version of Synapse, using Python 3\nwith a PostgreSQL database.</p>\n<p>Synapse\u2019s architecture is quite RAM hungry currently - we deliberately\ncache a lot of recent room data and metadata in RAM in order to speed up\ncommon requests. We\u2019ll improve this in the future, but for now the easiest\nway to either reduce the RAM usage (at the risk of slowing things down)\nis to set the almost-undocumented <tt>SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR</tt> environment\nvariable. The default is 0.5, which can be decreased to reduce RAM usage\nin memory constrained enviroments, or increased if performance starts to\ndegrade.</p>\n<p>However, degraded performance due to a low cache factor, common on\nmachines with slow disks, often leads to explosions in memory use due\nbacklogged requests. In this case, reducing the cache factor will make\nthings worse. Instead, try increasing it drastically. 2.0 is a good\nstarting value.</p>\n<p>Using <a href=\"http://jemalloc.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">libjemalloc</a> can also yield a significant\nimprovement in overall memory use, and especially in terms of giving back\nRAM to the OS. To use it, the library must simply be put in the\nLD_PRELOAD environment variable when launching Synapse. On Debian, this\ncan be done by installing the <tt>libjemalloc1</tt> package and adding this\nline to <tt><span class=\"pre\">/etc/default/matrix-synapse</span></tt>:</p>\n<pre>LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so.1\n</pre>\n<p>This can make a significant difference on Python 2.7 - it\u2019s unclear how\nmuch of an improvement it provides on Python 3.x.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re encountering high CPU use by the Synapse process itself, you\nmay be affected by a bug with presence tracking that leads to a\nmassive excess of outgoing federation requests (see <a href=\"https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3971\" rel=\"nofollow\">discussion</a>). If metrics\nindicate that your server is also issuing far more outgoing federation\nrequests than can be accounted for by your users\u2019 activity, this is a\nlikely cause. The misbehavior can be worked around by setting\n<tt>use_presence: false</tt> in the Synapse config file.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"people-can-t-accept-room-invitations-from-me\">\n<h3><a href=\"#id20\" rel=\"nofollow\">People can\u2019t accept room invitations from me</a></h3>\n<p>The typical failure mode here is that you send an invitation to someone\nto join a room or direct chat, but when they go to accept it, they get an\nerror (typically along the lines of \u201cInvalid signature\u201d).

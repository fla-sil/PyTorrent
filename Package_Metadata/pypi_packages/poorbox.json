This might also be a simple alternative\nto the complicated Dropbox setup on a server without X installed.\n\nGood news: this downloads only the files that have been modified.\n\nBad news: this is considerably slower than the \"real\" Dropbox software,\ndue to 2 reasons:\n\n1. No optimization has been done: files are downloaded sequentially.\n\n2. The Dropbox REST API only deals with entire files, not file-deltas.\n\nWe don't upload changes yet, so sync is one-way only.\nMaybe in the future!\n\nWhen you run the app for the first time and authorize in your browser,\nDropbox will create an \"Apps/poorbox\" directory which poorbox can see.\nYou can put files and folders there and poorbox will be able to\ndownload them. This is because this app currently has\n\"app_folder\" access, not entire dropbox access.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n- Python 2.7 or 3.x\n- An ability to install Python packages\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nWith one command you can install poorbox and its (few) dependencies.\nThis is achieved through the famous *pypi (Python Package Index)*,\nwhich hosts poorbox downloads here:\n\nhttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/poorbox\n\nThe command is:\n\n    easy_install -UZ poorbox\n\nIf you don't like *distribute* you can use *pip* and the result is the same:\n\n    pip install poorbox\n\nYou also need an app key\n------------------------\n\nThis software is in the process of getting approved by Dropbox. Meanwhile,\nto use it, you need your own *app key* and *app secret*. Please register\nwith Dropbox to obtain a key:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe installation procedure above puts in your path the ``poorbox`` command.\nThere is no other difference between invoking ``poorbox`` or ``poorbox.py``.\n\npoorbox has a few command-line arguments. Use the ``--help`` switch to view them:\n\n    poorbox -h\n\nOn the first run, poorbox will print a URL and pause. Click the URL to\nopen your web browser. There you will authenticate against Dropbox and\nauthorize poorbox to download your files for you. When done, go back to\nyour console and press Enter. poorbox will proceed to download your files.\n\nOn subsequent runs you don't need to authenticate anymore -- poorbox\ndownloads immediately. This is because poorbox stores its credentials\nin a cache -- a simple text file. There is a switch for you to control the\nlocation of this cache.\n\nConfiguration files aren't supported yet; in the meantime, I suggest you\njust create a little script to run poorbox with the necessary switches.\n\nBugs?

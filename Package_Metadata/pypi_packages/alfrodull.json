The original use case was to attach an led strip behind the monitor that turn on and off as the display does. But much more can be doen as additional events can easily be added. For example blinking the lights when notifications are received or tracking CPU usage and warning when it passes a threshold.\n\nRight now the only supported devices are those from [blinksticks](https://www.blinkstick.com/). More can be added if requested and I can get ahold of them.\n\nAlfrodull only works on Linux right now as all of the events uses DBUS notifications to react to events. Support for Windows could be added in the future but would require some other notification service.\n\n## Install\n```bash\npip install alfrodull\n```\n\n## Usage\nSimply start alfrodull and pass a configuration file path as input.\n```bash\nalfrodull config.yml\n```\nAlfrodull could for example be started in xinit or i3wm config.\n\n## Configuration\nAlfrodull is configured with a file, this is where the event, animation and, color are specified. Colors are defined as hex values ex. `#ff00ff`, the values will be checked when the program is started and throw an exception if they can't be parsed. Passing a null value to the color is parsed as turning off the lights.

If these values are not supplied when\ninstantiating the class, this module will attempt to prompt for them from stdin.\nsee the `API Doc <https://github.com/alextremblay/phpIPAM-Scraper/blob/master/docs/apidoc.rst>`_ for additional information.\n\n\nCommand Line Tool\n-----------------\nthe command line tool is called ``phpipam``  and can be used in one of two ways:\n\nWhen called with an argument, it processes that specific request, and then exits. When called without a command, it\ndrops you into a shell from which you can run multiple subcommands.\n\nThe benefit of running the shell is that phpIPAM authentication details will only be asked for once, and will be stored\nin memory until you exit the shell.\n\n**Warning:** Please take caution when using the shell.

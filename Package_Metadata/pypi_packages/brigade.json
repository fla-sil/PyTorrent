While most automation frameworks use their own DSL which you use to describe what you want to have done, Brigade lets you control everything from Python.\n\nOne of the benefits we want to highlight with this approach is the ease of troubleshooting, if something goes wrong you can just use your existing debug tools directly from Python (just add a line of `import pdb` & `pdb.set_trace()` and you're good to go). Doing the same using a DSL can be quite time consuming.\n\nWhat Brigade brings to the table is that it takes care of dealing with your inventory and manages the job of dispatching the tasks you want to run against your nodes and devices. The framework provides a very simple way to write plugins if you aren't happy with the ones we ship. Of course if you have written a plugin you think can be useful to others, please send us your code and test cases as a [pull request](https://github.com/brigade-automation/brigade/pulls).\n\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nWhile Brigade still supports Python 2.7 the recommended version is 3.6.

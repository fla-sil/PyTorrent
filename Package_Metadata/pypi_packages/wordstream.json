Wordstream has a command line interface, ``wordstream``, and a web interface usable by running ``paster serve wordstream.ini`` .  In both cases, the usage is the same. From an initial corpus, the user types lines of text. wordstream will eat the corpus and print a response to the text and feed the user's lines to the corpus\n\n\ndissociate interface\n--------------------\n\nNamed after emacs' ``M-x dissociated-press`` (try it!), dissociate will feed documents to a corpus, scramble the corpus (shuffle the stack order for each word), and output the corpus eating itself, selecting random words, eating their associations, and then eating the associations of the associations until the corpus is empty.  Dissociate has a command line interface (install the software and run ``dissociate --help`` for usage), and a web interface usable via paster serve dissociate.ini.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\nWhile the wordstream corpus is a simple model, the basic idea can be\nused to \n\n * Thesaurus: By feeding the corpus synonyms, wordstream could be used\n   as a thesaurus program.

It\nalso fits, because being offline is somewhat oldfashioned, just like the word\nhandkerchief.\n\nThere are three ways to set handkerchief up:\n\nUsing pip\n---------\n\nThis is the easiest way and probably the right choice for most people. Make\nsure you have `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ installed and type\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   pip install handkerchief\n\ninto your terminal to install handkerchief and all dependencies onto your\ncomputer. This might require admin access.\n\nYou can now invoke handkerchief from everywhere using\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   handkerchief\n\nIn a virtualenv\n---------------\n\nIf a system wide installation with pip is too intrusive for you, and you need\nhandkerchief only in a certain environment, you can try\n`virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_. Within the activated\nvirtualenv, just type\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   pip install handkerchief\n\nYou can then invoke handkerchief while you are in the virtualenv by typing\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   handkerchief\n\nAs standalone script\n--------------------\n\nYou can take just the handkerchief.py from the repository and put it where you need it. No installation required. From there you can invoke it with\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   python handkerchief.py --remote-layouts\n\nFrom repository\n---------------\n\nYou can also clone the repository to some place on your computer and use it\nfrom there. Depending on your system, you might want to make it available from\neverywhere by putting the repo in your PATH, define an alias or something else.\n\nFor example, if you are on a mac you can optionally add the following to your\n~/.bash_profile.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   function handkerchief {\n     # change this path to the location of handkerchief.py\n     hand=~/handkerchief/handkerchief.py\n     if [[ $1 != \"\" ]] ; then\n       python $hand --remote-layouts $1\n        else\n       repo=$(git remote -v | head -n1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed -e 's,.*:\\(.*/\\)\\?,,' -e 's/\\.git$//')\n       if [[ $repo == *https://* ]] ; then\n         python $hand ${repo#https://github.com/}\n       elif [[ $repo == *git@github.com* ]] ; then\n         python $hand ${repo#git@github.com:}\n       else\n         echo \"Provide parameter\"\n       fi\n     fi\n   }\n\n\nSpecifying repositories\n-----------------------\n\nThe simplest way to use handkerchief is to call it with the user or\norganisation and repository name\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   handkerchief jreinhardt/tissues\n\nIf you are calling handkerchief from within a git repository, it tries to figure out a GitHub repo for it\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   cd /path/to/repository\n   handkerchief\n\nOr if you have one or many .html files generated by handkerchief in a\ndirectory, it extracts the repositories to check from them.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   cd /path/to/directory/with/handkerchief/htmls\n   handkerchief\n\nCommandline parameters\n----------------------\n\nThere are a few options available, for example to choose a layout, specify how to authenticate (to avoid GitHubs rate limits) and much more.\n\nFor details see\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   handkerchief --help`.\n\n\nLayouts\n-------\n\nHandkerchief offers a simple way to modify the visual appearance and\nfunctionality of the resulting offline html file, by changing to a different layout.\n\nHandkerchief ships with a default layout that is available when installing with\npip. For developing layouts it is convenient to ask handkerchief to search for\nlayouts in a specific place using the `--layout-dir`. When using handkerchief\nas a standalone script, it can look layouts up at the handkerchief GitHub\nrepository using the `--remote-layouts` option.\n\nA layout consists of a parameter and a template file, and a number of\njavascript and css files, which reside in a subfolder of the layouts folder in\nthe handkerchief repository. To produce the output file, the template file gets\npopulated with the data, and the javascript and css files are inlined. If not\ntold otherwise, handkerchief will fetch layouts from the handkerchief GitHub\nrepository, so that always the most up to date version of the layout is used.\n\nThe parameter file is a json file with the same name as the subfolder in which\nit resides. It contains an associative array with three keys:\n\n* html: the file name of the template file\n* css: a list of filenames of stylesheets to inline\n* js: a list of filenames of javascript files to inline\n\nThe template is processed by `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_, and the\nfollowing variables are available:\n\n* reponame: a string with the name of the repository in the form\n  username/reponame\n* repo: a dictionary containing information about the repository, see\n  `GitHub API docs (1) <https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/>`_\n* issues: a list of dictionaries containing issue data, see\n  `GitHub API docs (2) <https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/>`_. Each\n  issue has an additional field:\n  - 'labelnames' with a list of all labels for this issue\n\n  - 'comments_list' with a list of all comments  for this issue\n    (see `GitHub API docs (3) <https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/comments>`_).\n    The comment data is augmented by a string in `comment['user']['avatar_class']`\n    which contains a css class that sets the avatar of the user as background\n    image of the element.\n\n  - `issue['user']['avatar_class']` which works in the same way as in comments.\n* labels: a list of dictionaries containing label data, see\n  `GitHub API docs (4) <https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/labels>`_\n* milestones: a list of dictionaries containing milestone data, see\n  `GitHub API docs (5) <https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/milestones>`_\n* assignees: a list of dictionaries contining information about assigness, see\n  `GitHub API docs (6) <https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/assignees>`_\n* javascript: a list of dictionaries with the names and contents of the\n  javascript files.\n* stylesheets: a list with the contents of the stylesheets. Additionally it\n  contains a stylesheet that defines classes of the form `avatar_username` that\n  set the avatar of a user as background image of an element.\n\nIf you have created a new layout or improved a existing one, feel free to open\na pull request, contributions are always welcome!\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nRequires `Python 2.7 <http://www.python.org>`_, the\n`Jinja2 template system <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_  and the\n`requests library <http://www.python-requests.org/>`_.\n\nFor most Linux distributions, these should be available via the package\nmanager. On MacOS you can install the dependencies by:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   # using homebrew\n   brew install python\n   # using pip\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nFor Windows there is an installer for Python available from the\n`Python Website <http://www.python.org/downloads>`_, and the rest can be\ninstalled via pip:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nContributors\n------------\n\nThere are a few people that contributed to handkerchief and therefore deserve to credit:\n\n* lukasoppermann turned the initial HTML template from horrible to beauti- and useful\n* laurentj contributed several small layout fixes\n* DonnchaC added code for authenticating by token\n* philfreo contributed a requirements.txt\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nHandkerchief is licensed under the `MIT license <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_\n\n    The MIT License (MIT)\n\n    Copyright (c) 2013 Johannes Reinhardt <jreinhardt@ist-dein-freund.de>\n\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

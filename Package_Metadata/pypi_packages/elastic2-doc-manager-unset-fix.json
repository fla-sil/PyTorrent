If you\nwant to target Elasticsearch 1.x, please install the\n`elastic-doc-manager <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/elastic-doc-manager>`_.\n\nElasticsearch 2.x\n-----------------\n\nFor use with an Elasticsearch 2.x server, install with\n`pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__::\n\n  pip install 'elastic2-doc-manager[elastic2]'\n\nElasticsearch 5.x\n-----------------\n\nFor use with an Elasticsearch 5.x server, install with::\n\n  pip install 'elastic2-doc-manager[elastic5]'\n\n.. note:: Version 0.3.0 added support for Elasticsearch 5.x.\n\n\nAmazon Elasticsearch Service\n----------------------------\n\nTo use with Amazon Elasticsearch Service, you must install the required AWS\ndependencies along with the version of Elasticsearch::\n\n  pip install 'elastic2-doc-manager[elastic2,aws]'\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nYou can also install the development version of elastic2-doc-manager\nmanually::\n\n  git clone https://github.com/mongodb-labs/elastic2-doc-manager.git\n  pip install -e './elastic2-doc-manager[elastic2]'\n\nYou may have to run ``pip`` with ``sudo``, depending on where you're\ninstalling and what privileges you have.\n\n.. note:: Please note that before mongo-connector version 2.2.2, the elastic\ndoc manager was packaged with mongo-connector and only supported\nElasticsearch 1.x.\n\nRunning the tests\n-----------------\nRequirements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n1. Copy of the Elastic 2.x Document Manager Github repository\n\n  The tests are not included in the package from PyPI and can only be acquired\n  by cloning this repository on Github::\n\n      git clone https://github.com/mongodb-labs/elastic2-doc-manager\n\n2. Mongo Orchestration\n\n  Mongo Connector runs MongoDB on its own using another tool called\n  `Mongo Orchestration <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-orchestration>`__.\n  This package should install automatically if you run ``python setup.py test``,\n  but the Mongo Orchestration server still needs to be started manually before\n  running the tests::\n\n      mongo-orchestration --bind 127.0.0.1 --config orchestration.config start\n\n  will start the server. To stop it::\n\n      mongo-orchestration --bind 127.0.0.1 --config orchestration.config stop\n\n  The location of the MongoDB server should be set in orchestration.config.\n  For more information on how to use Mongo Orchestration, or how to use it with\n  different arguments, please look at the Mongo-Orchestration README.\n\n3. Environment variables\n\n  There are a few influential environment variables that affect the tests. These are:\n\n    - ``DB_USER`` is the username to use if running the tests with authentication enabled.\n    - ``DB_PASSWORD`` is the password for the above.\n    - ``MONGO_PORT`` is the starting port for running MongoDB. Future nodes will be started on sequentially increasing ports.\n    - ``ES_HOST`` is the hostname on which Elasticsearch is running.\n    - ``ES_PORT`` is the port on which Elasticsearch is running.\n    - ``MO_ADDRESS`` is the address to use for Mongo Orchestration (i.e. hostname:port)\n    - ``PYTHON_ELASTIC_VERSION`` is the pip style version of Elasticsearch to test with (eg >=5.0.0,<6.0.0)\n\nAll the tests live in the `tests` directory.\n\nRunning tests on the command-line\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhile the tests take care of setting up and tearing down MongoDB clusters on\ntheir own, make sure to start Elasticsearch before doing a full test run!\n\nYou can run all the tests with one command (this works in all supported Python versions)::\n\n  python setup.py test\n\nIn addition, you can be more selective with which tests you run\nin Python > 2.6 only)! For example, if you only wanted to run the elastic2\ndoc manager tests::\n\n  python -m unittest tests.test_elastic2_doc_manager\n\nError messages\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSome of the tests are meant to generate lots of ``ERROR``-level log messages,\nespecially the rollback tests. mongo-connector logs exceptions it encounters\nwhile iterating the cursor in the oplog, so we see these in the console output\nwhile MongoDB clusters are being torn apart in the tests. As long as all the\ntests pass with an `OK` message, all is well.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/blancoms/elastic2-doc-manager", "keywords": "mongo-connector,mongodb,elastic,elasticsearch", "license": "Apache License, Version 2.0", "maintainer": "mongodb", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "elastic2-doc-manager-unset-fix", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/elastic2-doc-manager-unset-fix/", "platform": "any", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/elastic2-doc-manager-unset-fix/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/blancoms/elastic2-doc-manager"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/elastic2-doc-manager-unset-fix/1.0.0/", "requires_dist": ["mongo-connector (>=2.5.0)", "boto3 (>=1.4.0); extra == 'aws'", "requests-aws-sign (>=0.1.2); extra == 'aws'", "elasticsearch (<3.0.0,>=2.0.0); extra == 'elastic2'", "elasticsearch (<6.0.0,>=5.0.0); extra == 'elastic5'"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Elastic2 plugin for mongo-connector", "version": "1.0.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            ====================<br>elastic2-doc-manager<br>====================<br><br>.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/mongodb-labs/elastic2-doc-manager.svg?branch=master<br>   :alt: View build status<br>   :target: https://travis-ci.org/mongodb-labs/elastic2-doc-manager<br><br>Getting Started<br>===============<br><br>This package is a document manager for<br>`mongo-connector &lt;https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-connector&gt;`_ that<br>targets Elasticsearch versions 2.x and 5.x -- don't let the name fool you!<br>For information on running mongo-connector with Elasticsearch, please see the<br>`MongoConnector Usage with Elasticsearch<br>&lt;https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-connector/wiki/Usage%20with%20ElasticSearch&gt;`_<br>wiki page.<br><br>Installation<br>============<br><br>The installation of the elastic2-doc-manager depends on which version of<br>Elasticsearch you are targeting.<br><br>Elasticsearch 1.x<br>-----------------<br><br>This is the document manager for Elasticsearch 2.x and 5.x.

It is designed following the MVC design pattern, splitting the code into Controllers for defining drivers, Models for specifying the logic on how to use devices and perform an experiment. The View is where all the GUI is developed.\n\nPFTL was developed by [Uetke](https://www.uetke.com) to explain to researchers, through simple examples, what can be achieved quickly with little programming knowledge. The ultimate goal of this project is to serve as a reference place for people interested in instrumentation written in Python.\n\nYou can find the code of this package at [Github](https://github.com/PFTL/SimpleDaq/), the documentation is hosted at [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/python-for-the-lab/). If you are interested in learning more about Python For The Lab, you can check [Uetke's courses](https://uetke.com/courses/).\n\nThe GUI\n-------\n![Alt text](docs/source/_static/GUI_Python_For_The_Lab.png?raw=true \"GUI of Python For The Lab\")\n\nIf you follow the Python for the Lab course, the GUI is going to be the last step. You perform an analog output scan while acquiring the voltage on a different port. This will allow the users to acquire an I-V scan or any other voltage-dependent measurement.\n\nThe Device\n----------\n![Alt text](docs/source/_static/PFTL_Real_Device_r.JPG?raw=true \"GUI of Python For The Lab\")\n\nThe objective of PFTL is to control a device to measure the IV curve of an LED. The device is built on an Arduino DUE which has two Digital-to-Analog channels. The program monitors the voltage across a resistance while increasing the voltage applied to an LED. We can change all the parameters of the scan, including the input and output channels, the range, time delay, etc.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nAditional documentation can be found at [Read the Docs](http://python-for-the-lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/PFTL/SimpleDaq", "keywords": "", "license": "GPLv3", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "py4lab", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/py4lab/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/py4lab/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/PFTL/SimpleDaq"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/py4lab/0.1.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Code for Python for the Lab Workshop", "version": "0.1.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Welcome to Python For The Lab's documentation!</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://python-for-the-lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Documentation Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/4d7ddaf87e5a7b18ecd85159610f2424956b8bf6/68747470733a2f2f72656164746865646f63732e6f72672f70726f6a656374732f707974686f6e2d666f722d7468652d6c61622f62616467652f3f76657273696f6e3d6c6174657374\"></a> <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/PFTL/SimpleDaq\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Build Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/04e9abefe2c02c026a3aee3d6dc8e6f80ecfb3ea/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f5046544c2f53696d706c654461712e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a> <a href=\"https://coveralls.io/github/PFTL/SimpleDaq?branch=master\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Coverage Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/8e954cfd4ebfb67c234f1bdf42dd3553883e6cc1/68747470733a2f2f636f766572616c6c732e696f2f7265706f732f6769746875622f5046544c2f53696d706c654461712f62616467652e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a></p>\n<p>Python for the Lab (PFTL) is a simple program to acquire data from a DAQ device.

It is implemented in Python 3.7 and uses `AsyncIO <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_.\n\nSince a few new AsyncIO features were used in this program, it is necessary to have **Python 3.7 or higher** to run it.\n\nThis application is a CLI chat room program. However, it does not use a simple server-client way. All nodes are clients, any node can be a server from this point of view.\n\nFor better understanding, the server (node that manages the user messages) will be referred to as the *leader* and the AsyncIO component of the application that listens on the given port will be refered to as the *server* further on in the docuentation. Meaning that any node has a *server*, however only one node in the chatroom is the *leader*.\n\nThe chatroom is a network ring (a node only knows its *next* and *previous* node), however all nodes know the *leader* node as well in order to send it a message. The first node that creates the chatroom is automtically its *leader*. When the *leader* dies or logs out, the new *leader* is elected using `Chang-Roberts leader election algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang_and_Roberts_algorithm>`_. \n\nWhen the user types a message, the node sends it to the *leader* node and the *leader* distributes it to all the participants (the *leader* knows them all).\n\nWhen a node wants to join the chat room, all it needs is one address of any node that is already in the room.\n\nWhen a node logs out or dies without informing the others, its next and previous nodes detect it and repair the ring.\n\nInstallation\n------------\nThe program is uploaded on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/soucevi1-dist-chat/>`_.\n\nFor the newest version, just type::\n\n   python -m pip install soucevi1_dist_chat\n\nFor any specific version, type::\n\n   python -m pip install soucevi1_dist_chat==<version>\n\nYou can also clone and use the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/soucevi1/dist-chat>`_.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nCreating the chatroom\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTo run the application as the leader node after the installation, type::\n\n   soucevi1_dist_chat -l -a <IP> -p <port> -n <your name>\n\nWhere ``<IP>`` and ``<port>`` is the IP address and port the node will listen on, ``<your name>`` is the username of your choice and ``-l`` stands for being the *leader*.\n\nJoining the existing chatroom\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTo join the existing chatroom, you need to know IP ``<nIP>`` and port ``<nPort>`` of any node that is already in the chatroom::\n\n   soucevi1_dist_chat -a <IP> -p <port> -n <your name> -na <nIP> -np <nPort>\n\nLogging\n^^^^^^^\n\nIn both cases you can specify the option ``-v`` that stands for verbose. Without ``-v``, the application logs into file (``chat_<port>.log``). With ``-v`` the application logs to the file as well as to the stdout.\n\nThe format of the log message is::\n\n   TS: message\n\nWhere ``TS`` is Lamport logical clock timestamp.\n\nChatting\n^^^^^^^^\n\nOnce you start the *leader*, you won't be able to do anything until the first connection of another node is made. After that, you get a prompt that looks like this::\n\n   > Name(IP:port): \n\nWhere you can write your message and press Enter to send it. Received message looks simillar::\n\n   > Name(IP:port)[Lamport timestamp]: Hello from Name\n\n\nTo exit the application, instead of your message simply write ``//exit``.\n\nHelp\n^^^^\n\nFor help, run::\n\n   soucevi1_dist_chat --help\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nYou can take a look at the documentation on this `website <https://soucevi1-dist-chat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.\n\nOr, you can build it using Sphinx::\n\n   $ cd docs\n   $ make html\n\nYou can replace ``html`` in the command with whatever Sphinx currently supports.

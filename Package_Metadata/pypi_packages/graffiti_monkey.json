By looking at the tags an EC2\ninstance has, it copies those tags to the EBS Volumes that are attached to it,\nand then copies those tags to the EBS Snapshots.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n::\n\n\tusage: graffiti-monkey [-h] [--region REGION] [--profile PROFILE] [--verbose] [--version] [--config CONFIG.YML] [--dryrun]\n\n\tPropagates tags from AWS EC2 instances to EBS volumes, and then to EBS\n\tsnapshots. This makes it much easier to find things down the road.\n\n\toptional arguments:\n\t  -h, --help           show this help message and exit\n\t  --region REGION      the region to tag things in (default is current region of\n\t                       EC2 instance this is running on). E.g. us-east-1\n\t  --profile PROFILE    the profile to use to connect to EC2 (default is 'default',\n\t                       see Boto docs for profile credential options)\n\t  --verbose, -v        enable verbose output (-vvv for more)\n\t  --version            display version number and exit\n\t  --config CONFIG.YML  read a yaml configuration file.  specify tags to propagate without changing code.\n\t  --dryrun             dryrun only, display tagging actions but do not perform them\n\t  --append             append propagated tags to existing tags (up to a total of ten tags). When not set,\n\t                       graffiti-monkey will overwrite existing tags.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nSuppose you have the following in `us-east-1`:\n\n::\n\n\ti-abcd1234\n\t  - Tags:\n\t    - Name: \"Instance 1\"\n\n\tvol-bcde3456\n\t  - Attached to i-abcd1234 on /dev/sda1\n\n\tsnap-cdef4567\n\t  - Snapshot of vol-bcde3456\n\n\nWhen you run:\n\n::\n\n    graffiti-monkey --region us-east-1\n\n\nFirst, Graffiti Monkey will set the EBS volume tags\n\n::\n\n\tvol-bcde3456\n\t  - Tags:\n\t    - Name: \"Instance 1\"\n\t    - instance_id: i-abcd1234\n\t    - device: /dev/sda1\n\nand then it will set the tags on the EBS Snapshot\n\n::\n\n\tsnap-cdef4567\n\t  - Tags:\n\t    - Name: \"Instance 1\"\n\t    - instance_id: i-abcd1234\n\t    - device: /dev/sda1\n\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install Graffiti Monkey using the usual PyPI channels. Example:\n\n::\n\n    sudo pip install graffiti_monkey\n\nYou can find the package details here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graffiti_monkey\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to install from source:\n\n::\n\n    git clone git@github.com:Answers4AWS/graffiti-monkey.git\n    cd graffiti-monkey\n    python setup.py install\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nThis project uses `Boto <http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`__ to\ncall the AWS APIs. You can pass your AWS credentials to Boto can by using a\n:code:`.boto` file, IAM Roles or environment variables. Full information can be\nfound here:\n\nhttp://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html\n\nGraffiti-monkey itself can be configured using a yaml file\n\n::\n\n  ---\n  #region: us-west-1\n  _instance_tags_to_propagate:\n    - 'Name'\n    - 'Owner'\n\n  _volume_tags_to_propagate:\n    - 'Name'\n    - 'instance_id'\n    - 'device'\n    - 'Owner'\n\n:code:`_instance_tags_to_propagate` is used to define the tags that are propagated\nfrom an instance to its volumes. :code:`_volume_tags_to_propagate` defines the tags\nthat are propagated from a volume to its snapshots.\n\nWhen using yaml configuration files you need to have pyYAML. This can be easily setup\n using pip :code:`pip install PyYAML`.  If you don't use config files you don't have\n this limitation.\n\n\nWiki\n----\n\nCan be found here: https://github.com/Answers4AWS/graffiti-monkey/wiki\n\n\nSource Code\n-----------\n\nThe Python source code for Graffiti Monkey is available on GitHub:\n\nhttps://github.com/Answers4AWS/graffiti-monkey\n\n\nAbout Answers for AWS\n---------------------\n\nThis code was written by `Peter\nSankauskas <https://twitter.com/pas256>`__, founder of `Answers for\nAWS <http://answersforaws.com/>`__ - a company focused on helping businesses\nlearn how to use AWS, without doing it the hard way.

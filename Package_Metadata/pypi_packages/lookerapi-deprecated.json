Pass API3 credentials to the **/login** endpoint to obtain a temporary access_token. \n# Include that access_token in the Authorization header of Looker API requests. For details, see [Looker API Authorization](https://looker.com/docs/r/api/authorization)  ### Client SDKs  The Looker API is a RESTful system that should be usable by any programming language capable of making HTTPS requests. Client SDKs for a variety of programming languages can be generated from the Looker API&#39;s Swagger JSON metadata to streamline use of the Looker API in your applications. A client SDK for Ruby is available as an example. For more information, see [Looker API Client SDKs](https://looker.com/docs/r/api/client_sdks)  ### Try It Out!  The &#39;api-docs&#39; page served by the Looker instance includes &#39;Try It Out!&#39; buttons for each API method. After logging in with API3 credentials, you can use the \\&quot;Try It Out!\\&quot; buttons to call the API directly from the documentation page to interactively explore API features and responses.  ### Versioning  Future releases of Looker will expand this API release-by-release to securely expose more and more of the core power of Looker to API client applications. API endpoints marked as \\&quot;beta\\&quot; may receive breaking changes without warning. Stable (non-beta) API endpoints should not receive breaking changes in future releases.

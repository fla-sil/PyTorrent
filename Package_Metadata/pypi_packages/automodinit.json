This causes the following, irritating\nproblems:\n\n1. Test suites don't find docstring tests.\n2. Static analysis tools don't see some module content in __all__.\n3. Things which scan themselves for plugins mismatch what os.listdir()\n   returns as against what the module import table has.\n4. I waste time over something which should take care of itself.\n5. os.listdir() based solutions tend to fail when freezed into\n   an executable binary because they don't understand running from\n   inside a ZIP archive.\n\nSo here's how to make the problem go away forever:\n\n1. Include the automodinit package into your setup.py dependencies.\n2. Replace all __init__.py files like this:\n\n__all__ = [\"I will get rewritten\"]\n# Don't modify the line above, or this line!\nimport automodinit\nautomodinit.automodinit(__name__, __file__, globals())\ndel automodinit\n# Anything else you want can go after here, it won't get modified.\n\n3. That's it! From now on importing a module will set __all__ to\n   a list of .py[co] files in the module and will also import each\n   of those files as though you had typed:\n\n   for x in __all__: import x\n\n   Therefore the effect of \"from M import *\" matches exactly \"import M\".\n\nCustomising:\n-=-=-=-=-=-=\nautomodinit can take the following additional parameters:\n\nfilter: This is a callable which will be passed a list of tuples\n        (loader, modulename, ispkg) which is the output of\n        pkgutil.iter_modules() for the calling module.

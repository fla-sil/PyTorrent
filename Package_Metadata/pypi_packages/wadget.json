Package managers from the CLI have been a godsend for installing software, so I decided to try and port the idea to Doom addons.\n\nDoom was a game I fell in love with as a kid, and with this CLI tool you can easily download and search for new levels and files from the /idgames archive as you would apt-get or any other packaging solution. Of course it is a work in progress, but I hope it comes in handy!\n\n### Install\nFirstly, clone or download the git repository and navigate to it within a terminal. You MUST have Python3 and pip (3, if necessary to specify on your OS) installed for wadget to function.\n\nSimply run this command from within the root wadget directory. wadget uses Python3, so you must specify pip3 if necessary on your system:\n```\n$ pip3 install .\n```\nYou can now use wadget from the command line.\n\n#### PyPi\nPyPi carries the latest \"stable\" release of wadget:\n```\n$ pip3 install wadget\n```\n\n### Usage\nTo get started with basic usage, we can download Community Chest 3 to the working directory using:\n```\n$ wadget cchest3\n```\nIf we wanted to search for all Community Chest files, or get a specific file ID for download, we can use the -s flag:\n```\n$ wadget cchest -s\n```\nThis will return:\n```\nThe Community Chest Project\n---------------------------\nFILE ID: 12021\n\nThis is a compilation of levels from the Doom Community\n\nCommunity Chest 2\n-----------------\nFILE ID: 13024\n\nFollowing the success of the original Community Chest, Community Chest 2 is a 32 map megawad including levels made by 26 different authors from the Doom Community. Originally announced almost one year ago in December 2003, it is now complete and ready for your enjoyment.\n\nCommunity Chest 3\n-----------------\nFILE ID: 15156\n\nThe third installment of the series, Community Chest 3 boasts 32 maps made by 20 different authors from the Doom community.

Compared to CGI, SCGI is more efficient because it does not fork\nand execute a separate instance of the application for every request; instead,\nthe application is launched ahead of time and receives multiple requests\n(either sequentially or concurrently) via socket connections. Compared to\nFastCGI, SCGI is a much simpler protocol as it uses a separate socket\nconnection for each request, rather than including framing within a single\nconnection to multiplex requests (a feature which is rarely used in FastCGI\nanyway due to the lack of per-request flow control).\n\nSee the Wikipedia_ and Python_ SCGI pages for more information.\n\n\nWhat is Sans-I/O?\n=================\n\nSans-I/O is a philosophy for developing protocol processing libraries in which\nthe library does not do any I/O. Instead, a user of the library is responsible\nfor transferring blocks of bytes between the socket or pipe and the protocol\nlibrary, and for receiving application-level protocol items from and sending\nthem to the library. This obviously makes a sans-I/O library a little more\ndifficult to use, but comes with the advantage that the same library can be\nused with any I/O and concurrency mechanism: the same library should be usable\nin a single-request-at-a-time server, a process-per-request or\nthread-per-request blocking server, a server using select/poll and\ncontinuations, or a server using asyncio, Twisted, or any other asynchronous\nframework.\n\nSee SansIO_ for more information.\n\n\nHow do I install it?\n====================\n\nsioscgi\u2019s releases are published on PyPI for installation through pip. You can\nrun ``pip install sioscgi``.\n\nFor development, the source is available at GitLab_ and GitHub_.\n\n\nHow do I use it?\n================\n\nIn general terms, as follows:\n\n1. Accept an SCGI connection from the HTTP server (or other SCGI client).\n2. Construct an ``SCGIConnection`` object.\n3. Receive the request from the SCGI client by repeating the following until a\n   ``RequestEnd`` event occurs:\n\n   a) Read some bytes from the connection and pass them to\n      ``SCGIConnection.receive_data``.\n   b) Call ``SCGIConnection.next_event`` to receive high-level events\n      corresponding to the received data (one ``RequestHeaders``, zero or more\n      ``RequestBody`` events, and one ``RequestEnd``).\n\n4. Send the response to the SCGI client using ``SCGIConnection.send``, sending\n   first a ``ResponseHeaders`` event, then zero or more ``ResponseBody`` events,\n   then a ``ResponseEnd`` event, and sending the returned bytes over the\n   connection.\n\nThis being a sans-I/O library, how exactly you implement each step will depend\non what I/O and application framework you\u2019re working under. For example, for a\nthread-per-request or process-per-request server, you would likely do a\nblocking receive from a normal function in step 3.1; in an asyncio-based server\nyou would instead ``await`` new data from a coroutine.\n\nFor detailed information about the classes and methods available, see the\nmodule documentation provided in the docstrings by running ``import sioscgi``\nfollowed by ``help(sioscgi)``.\n\n\n.. _Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Common_Gateway_Interface\n.. _Python: http://www.python.ca/scgi/\n.. _SansIO: https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/\n.. _GitLab: https://gitlab.com/Hawk777/sioscgi\n.. _GitHub: https://github.com/Hawk777/sioscgi\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/Hawk777/sioscgi", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "sioscgi", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/sioscgi/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/sioscgi/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/Hawk777/sioscgi"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/sioscgi/2.1.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "A sans-I/O implementation of the SCGI specification.", "version": "2.1.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"what-is-sioscgi\">\n<h2>What is sioscgi?</h2>\n<p>sioscgi is an implementation of the Simple Common Gateway Interface (SCGI)\nprotocol under the Sans-I/O philosophy.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"what-is-scgi\">\n<h2>What is SCGI?</h2>\n<p>SCGI is a protocol used for communication between HTTP servers and Web\napplications.

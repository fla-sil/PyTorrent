The options remain visible to Managers and Personnel \nManagers who may need to access them.\n\nIn particular, this product will:\n\n* Hide the Contents, Sharing, and Relations tabs from the user (when viewing their Person).\n\n* Hide the Actions and Display menus from the user (when viewing their Person).\n\n* Hide the Employment Information, User Settings, categorization, dates, ownership, and settings schema fields from   the user (when editing their Person).\n\n* Correct the versioning configuration so that the \"Save as new version\" box\n  will not display at the bottom when editing a Person (unless versioning is\n  enabled).\n\n* (Plone 3) Make the username in the personal bar link directly to the FSD profile,\n  instead of the Plone dashboard (and hide the default FSD 'My Folder' link).\n  \n* (Plone 4) Rename the FSD 'My Folder' link to 'My Profile' in the personal tools.\n  \nInstallation Notes\n------------------\nYou should install FacultyStaffDirectory first before using this product.  FSD Simplifier will uninstall safely, but the permissions to access the Actions and Display menus on Persons will remain disabled for the user.

It is likely to be compatible with later versions, but you should test on a development instance first.\n\nCredits\n============\n\nThis product was first developed by Heather Wozniak during the West Coast Plone Sprint 2010 organized by the Los Angeles Plone Users Group (http://laplone.org).  \n\nSpecial thanks to Alec Mitchell and Luke Brannon for their guidance and assistance with this project.

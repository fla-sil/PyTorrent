It is *NOT* useable using\nplain plone. It is intended to be used in conjunction with\n``anthill.skinner`` package. Look there for more information.\n\nTo remember: This theme relies on the idea that for anonymous users you want\nto have a flexible theme that is easy to set up and for yourself or content\neditors you want to unleash the full power of Plone by leaving the interface\nas is. This paradigma is enough for most Plone websites imho.\n\nInstallation\n-------------\n\n- Include anthill.exampletheme in your buildout\n- Make sure to have it included in instance zcml and eggs option\n- Also dont' forget to include anthill.skinner, anthill.tal.macrorenderer and\n  z3c.autoinclude\n- Go to portal_quickinstaller and install anthill.skinner\n- Then install anthill.exampletheme\n- Click on \"Show Preview\" on the upper right corner in Plone\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\n- z3c.autoinclude\n- anthill.skinner >= 0.2\n- anthill.tal.macrorenderer\n\nHow does it look like?\n----------------------\n\n.. image:: http://files.banality.de/public/anthill.exampletheme.jpg\n\nHow to create a public skin?\n----------------------------\n\nI'm currently creating a paster template that creates all the files and dirs needed to\nstart right away. This template is based on plone3_theme and has no big\ndifferences (but important and subtle ones).\n\nBut before invoking paster you should have a look at this \nexample in order to see how easy it is to create your own layout. I will\ndescribe the steps needed in order to build a public view:\n\n- I assume you have a ready to use design ready. I took mine from\n  freecsstemplates.org. I got images, one css file and the index.html.\n\n- Create a package (e.g. my.theme) using ``paster create -t plone3_theme my.theme``\n\n- Copy all images to browser/images\n\n- Copy your css file to browser/stylesheets/main.css\n\n- Copy main_template.pt from this package\n  (skins/anthill_exampletheme_custom_templates) to\n  skins/my_theme_custom_templates\n\n- Copy publicmenu_levels.pt from this package\n  (skins/anthill_exampletheme_custom_templates) to\n  skins/my_theme_custom_templates\n\n- Fire up your favourite editor and open\n  skins/my_theme_custom_templates/main_template\n\n- Delete all stuff in the body tag\n\n- Copy the contents of your index.html between body tags\n\n- Look at how this package uses menu structures and insert menu call at\n  correct places. Also have a look at publicmenu_levels.pt where menu\n  definitions live.\n\n- Do not forget to include the \"Back to Plone\" link!\n\n- Now make sure that your profiles/default/skins.xml matches the one from this\n  package. You do need to change the contents in skin-path to be based on\n  *publicview* and not *Plone Default*. Yu also need to make sure that the\n  first layer (my_theme_custom_templates) has attribute\n  insert-before=\"anthill_skinner_templates\"\n\nNow you should be ready to start with your new skin. Make sure to install\nanthill.skinner first and then install your package. Go to Plone interface and\nthen you should have a new link on the upper right that reads \"Show Preview\".\nClick and if you did all right you should see your shiny layout.\n\nI think you agree that this is very easy and will take you at most an\nhour to have every design ready. How long will it take to have this design on\ntop of Plone w/o publicview? Don't know - not my problem :)\n\nFeedback to the author\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.2 - 2009-08-09\n----------------\n\n* Fixed some setuptools issues and added more doc [spamsch]\n\n0.1 - 2009-08-08\n----------------\n\n* Initial release", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "UNKNOWN", "keywords": "web zope plone anthill skin theme", "license": "GPL", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "anthill.exampletheme", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/anthill.exampletheme/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/anthill.exampletheme/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "UNKNOWN"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/anthill.exampletheme/0.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Example theme for anthill.skinner", "version": "0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"introduction\">\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>This package provides a public theme for Plone.

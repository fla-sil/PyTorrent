On Mac OSX, you may have to use `/usr/local/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate`. You can copy the code as is below, including the preceeding dot.\n\n```bash\n. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate\n```\n\nStep 2:\n\n* Install the extension\n\n\n>You can download the source code and install the extension manually. To do so, execute the following command:\n> ```bash\n> pip install -e git+https://github.com/shemogumbe/ckanext-dataviewanalytics.git#egg=ckanext-dataviewanalytics\n> ```\n> **Alternatively**: You can clone this repo (preferably into the /src directory where you installed CKAN), cd into ckanext-dataviewanalytics and run\n>```bash\n> python setup.py develop\n> ```\n> Install necessary requirements\n>```bash\n> pip install -r requirements.txt\n> ```\n\nStep 3:\n\n* Modify your configuration file (generally in `/etc/ckan/default/production.ini`) and add `dataviewanalytics` to the `ckan.plugins` property.\n\n```bash\nckan.plugins = dataviewanalytics <OTHER_PLUGINS>\n```\n\nStep 4:\n\n* Restart your server:\n\n```bash\npaster serve /etc/ckan/default/production.ini\n```\n\nOR\n\n```bash\npaster serve --reload /etc/ckan/default/production.ini\n```\n\nWith `--reload`, your server is restarted automatically whenever you make changes to your source code.\n\n\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nIf you've found a bug/issue in the extension, please open a new issue [here](https://github.com/shemogumbe/ckanext-dataviewanalytics/issues/new) (try\nsearching first to see if there's already an [issue](https://github.com/shemogumbe/ckanext-dataviewanalytics/issues) for your bug).\n\n\n\nContributing to DataViewAnalytics CKAN Extension\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have interest in contributing to the development of DataViewAnalytics extension, you are welcome. A good starting point\nwill be reading the CKAN general [Contributing guide](http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-2.7.0/contributing/index.html). Then you can check out \nexisting [issues](https://github.com/shemogumbe/ckanext-dataviewanalytics/issues) that are open for contribution; new features and issues are welcome.\nTo work on any issue, comment on the issue to indicate your interest and the issue will be assigned to you.

We presented there the difficulty measure which we discovered and have provided this Python package of code which can calculate it.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis code is pip-installable so can be installed on your machine by running:\n\n`pip3 install edm`\n\nThe code requires Python 3 and NumPy.\n\nIt is recommended that you install this code in a `virtualenv`:\n\n```commandline\n$ mkdir myvirtualenv/\n$ virtualenv -p python3 myvirtualenv/\n$ source bin/activate\n(myvirtualenv) $ pip3 install edm\n```\n\n## Running\n\nTo calculate the difficulty of a text classification dataset, you will need to provide two lists: one of sentences and one of labels. These two lists need to be the same length - i.e. every sentence has a label. Each item of data should be an untokenized string and each label a string.\n\n```python\n>>> sents, labels = your_own_loading_function(PATH_TO_DATA_FILE)\n>>> sents\n[\"this is a positive sentence\", \"this is a negative sentence\", ...]\n>>> labels\n[\"positive\", \"negative\", ...]\n>>> assert len(sents) == len(labels)\nTrue\n```\n\nThis code does **not** support the loading of data files (e.g. csv files) into memory - you will need to do this separately.\n\nOnce you have loaded your dataset into memory, you can receive a \"difficulty report\" by running the code as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom edm import report\n\nsents, labels = your_own_loading_function(PATH_TO_DATA_FILE)\n\nprint(report.get_difficulty_report(sents, labels))\n```\n\nNote that if your dataset is very large, then counting the words of the dataset may take several minutes. The Amazon Reviews dataset from _Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text\nClassification_ by Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao and Yann LeCun, 2015 which contains 3.6 million Amazon reviews takes approximately 15 minutes to be processed and the difficulty report created.

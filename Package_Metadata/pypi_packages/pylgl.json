For ease of deployment, the lingeling source files\nare included in this project. These files have\nbeen extracted from lingeling version bbe-6fe9691-170131.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe ``pylgl`` module has two functions ``solve`` and ``itersolve``,\nboth of which take an iterable of clauses as an argument. Each clause\nis itself represented as an iterable of (non-zero) integers.\n\nThe function ``solve`` returns one of the following:\n  * one solution (a list of integers)\n  * the string \"UNSAT\" (when the clauses are unsatisfiable)\n  * the string \"UNKNOWN\" (when a solution could not be determined within the\n    propagation limit)\n\nThe function ``itersolve`` returns an iterator over solutions.  When the\npropagation limit is specified, exhausting the iterator may not yield all\npossible solutions.\n\nBoth functions take the following keyword arguments:\n  * ``vars``: number of variables (integer)\n  * ``verbose``: the verbosity level (integer)\n  * ``simplify``: enable simplification (integer)\n  * ``seed``: random number generator seed (integer)\n  * ``randec``: enable random decisions order (integer)\n  * ``randecint``: random decision order interval (integer)\n  * ``randphase``: enable random decision phases (integer)\n  * ``randphaseint``: random decision phases interval (integer)\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nLet us consider the following clauses, represented using\nthe DIMACS `cnf <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form>`_\nformat::\n\n   p cnf 5 3\n   1 -5 4 0\n   -1 5 3 4 0\n   -3 -4 0\n\nHere, we have 5 variables and 3 clauses, the first clause being\n(x\\ :sub:`1`  or not x\\ :sub:`5` or x\\ :sub:`4`).\nNote that the variable x\\ :sub:`2` is not used in any of the clauses,\nwhich means that for each solution with x\\ :sub:`2` = True, we must\nalso have a solution with x\\ :sub:`2` = False.  In Python, each clause is\nmost conveniently represented as a list of integers.  Naturally, it makes\nsense to represent each solution also as a list of integers, where the sign\ncorresponds to the Boolean value (+ for True and - for False) and the\nabsolute value corresponds to i\\ :sup:`th` variable::\n\n   >>> import pylgl\n   >>> cnf = [[1, -5, 4], [-1, 5, 3, 4], [-3, -4]]\n   >>> pylgl.solve(cnf)\n   [1, -2, -3, -4, 5]\n\nThis solution translates to: x\\ :sub:`1` = x\\ :sub:`5` = True,\nx\\ :sub:`2` = x\\ :sub:`3` = x\\ :sub:`4` = False\n\nTo find all solutions, use ``itersolve``::\n\n   >>> for sol in pylgl.itersolve(cnf):\n   ...     print sol\n   ...\n   [1, -2, -3, -4, 5]\n   [1, -2, -3, 4, -5]\n   [1, -2, -3, 4, 5]\n   ...\n   >>> len(list(pylgl.itersolve(cnf)))\n   18\n\nIn this example, there are a total of 18 possible solutions, which had to\nbe an even number because x\\ :sub:`2` was left unspecified in the clauses.\n\nThe fact that ``itersolve`` returns an iterator, makes it very elegant\nand efficient for many types of operations.  For example, using\nthe ``itertools`` module from the standard library, here is how one\nwould construct a list of (up to) 3 solutions::\n\n   >>> import itertools\n   >>> list(itertools.islice(pylgl.itersolve(cnf), 3))\n   [[1, -2, -3, -4, 5], [1, -2, -3, 4, -5], [1, -2, -3, 4, 5]]\n\n\nImplementation of itersolve\n---------------------------\n\nHow does one go from having found one solution to another solution?\nThe answer is surprisingly simple.  One adds the *inverse* of the already\nfound solution as a new clause.  This new clause ensures that another\nsolution is searched for, as it *excludes* the already found solution.\nHere is basically a pure Python implementation of ``itersolve`` in terms\nof ``solve``::\n\n   def py_itersolve(clauses): # don't use this function!\n       while True:            # (it is only here to explain things)\n           sol = pylgl.solve(clauses)\n           if isinstance(sol, list):\n               yield sol\n               clauses.append([-x for x in sol])\n           else: # no more solutions -- stop iteration\n               return\n\nThis implementation has several problems.  Firstly, it is quite slow as\n``pylgl.solve`` has to convert the list of clauses over and over and over\nagain.  Secondly, after calling ``py_itersolve`` the list of clauses will\nbe modified.  In pylgl, ``itersolve`` is implemented on the C level,\nmaking use of the lingeling C interface (which makes it much, much faster\nthan the naive Python implementation above).", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/abfeldman/pylgl", "keywords": null, "license": "MIT", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "pylgl", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pylgl/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pylgl/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/abfeldman/pylgl"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pylgl/0.0.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "bindings to lgl (a SAT solver)", "version": "0.0.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"authors\">\n<h2>Authors:</h2>\n<p>A lot of Python binding code and documentation has been lifted from PycoSAT\n&lt;<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycosat\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycosat</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>Lingeling is owned by Armin Biere &lt;<a href=\"http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>Pylgl is distributed under the same terms as Lingeling.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"abstract\">\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lingeling</a> is an efficient\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem\" rel=\"nofollow\">SAT</a> solver\nwritten by Armin Biere in pure C.\nThis package provides efficient Python bindings to Lingeling on the C level,\ni.e., when importing pylgl, the lingeling solver becomes part of the\nPython process itself.

When\nthe bank statement matches one or more journal entry for a line and\nthere is a remaining balance, Odoo proposes you to click on buttons that\nwill generate write-off entries according to pre-configured *Reconciliation\nModels*. The aim of this module is to automatically click\nfor you on these buttons (i.e. create the write-off journal entries)\nwhen some rules are respected, rules that you can configure.\n\nIt contains 2 types of rules (but can be extended with additional rules),\ndescribed below:\n\nRoundings\n  The most basic rule: when the remaining balance is within a range, 1\n  or more operations are applied.\n\nCurrencies\n  When the remaining balance is within a range and the currency of all\n  the lines is the same but different from the company's, and the amount\n  currency is the same, 1 or more operations are applied.\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nAs this module aims to automatize the ``Reconciliation Models``,\nyou first want to ensure that you have at least one model configured.\nYou can find them in ``Invoicing > Dashboard > Bank card > More\n> Reconciliation Models``. An example of a common operation is:\n\n=================== ========================== ======= ========\nAccount             Amount Type                Amount  Label\n=================== ========================== ======= ========\nDepends of the l10n Percentage of open balance 100.0 % Rounding\n=================== ========================== ======= ========\n\nThe configuration of the rules themselves happens in ``Invoicing >\nDashboard > Bank card > More > Reconciliation Rules``. Refer to\nthe description of the types of rules above in case of doubt. The form\nis divided in 2 parts: **Rule** and **Result**. The rule part is where\nyou will set the conditions and the result part is what operations will\nbe done if the conditions are valid.\n\nFor the **Roundings** rules, you will set a min. and a max. amount. It\ncan be negative or positive. The amount is compared to the remaining\nbalance when lines are matched in the bank statement.  Example: if you\nwant to create a move line in a loss account when you received 1.- not\nenough, you can create a rule with an min. amount of -1.0 and a max.\namount of 0.0.\n\nFor the **Currencies** rules, the min. and max. amount have the same\nproperties, but you will also set the currencies for which the rule\napplies. Setting the currency allows to configure different amounts\naccording to the currencies.\n\nOnly the first rule matching the current situation is used, so if you\nhave several rules overlapping for some reason, be sure to order them\nappropriately in the list view.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nWhen you use the *Reconcile* button of a bank statement, Odoo\nautomatically proposes you matching journal entries for each statement\nline.  This module automatically adds journal entries generated from the\n*Reconciliation Models* if a rule matches with the current\nsituation, so there is nothing special to do once the rules are\nconfigured.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/98/11.0\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/account-reconcile/issues>`_.

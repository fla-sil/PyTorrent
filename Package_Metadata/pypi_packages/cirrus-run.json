Currently used in CI pipeline for at least one\nproject.\n\n## Overview\n\ncirrus-run is a CLI application that allows you to execute builds in\nCirrusCI.\n\nIt uses local YAML files for build configuration, but requires a reference to\nGitHub repo and branch to assign ownership of the build. The build itself may\nhave no relation to the specified GitHub repo. This enables integration with\nother source code hosting platforms, [e.g. with GitLab][blog]: you can trigger\nCirrusCI builds by executing cirrus-run in GitLab CI\n\n[blog]: https://potyarkin.ml/posts/2020/cirrus-ci-integration-for-gitlab-projects/\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\ncirrus-run can be installed with pip:\n\n```\npip install cirrus-run\n```\n\nLatest development versions are also installable:\n\n```\npip install \"https://github.com/sio/cirrus-run/tarball/master#egg=cirrus-run\"\n```\n\nYou can also run it in Docker:\n[potyarkin/cirrus-run](https://hub.docker.com/r/potyarkin/cirrus-run).\nThis image is especially useful for integrating with other CI platforms.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nusage: cirrus-run [-h] [--token TOKEN] [--github REPO] [--branch BRANCH] [-v]\n                  [CONFIG]\n\nExecute CI jobs in CirrusCI\n\npositional arguments:\n  CONFIG           Path to YAML configuration file or Jinja2 template for such\n                   file. Filenames ending with .j2 or .jinja2 are assumed to\n                   provide the templates. All environment variables are\n                   available inside these templates. Default value:\n                   $CIRRUS_CONFIG or .cirrus.yml or .cirrus.yml.j2\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help       show this help message and exit\n  --token TOKEN    Access token for CirrusCI API. Recommended and more secure\n                   way of providing the token is via environment variable.\n                   Default value: $CIRRUS_API_TOKEN\n  --github REPO    GitHub repo id that will own the build (\"owner/reponame\").\n                   This repo may have no relation to the CI job being\n                   executed. It may even be empty. Default value:\n                   $CIRRUS_GITHUB_REPO\n  --branch BRANCH  GitHub repo branch that will own the build. This branch may\n                   have no relation to the CI job being executed. Default\n                   value: $CIRRUS_GITHUB_BRANCH or master\n  -v, --verbose    Increase output verbosity. Repeating this argument multiple\n                   times increases verbosity level even further.\n```\n\n\n## Support and contributing\n\nIf you need help with using cirrus-run, please create\n**[an issue](https://github.com/sio/cirrus-run/issues)**. Issues are also the\nprimary venue for reporting bugs and posting feature requests. General\ndiscussion related to this project is also acceptable and very welcome!\n\nIn case you wish to contribute code or documentation, feel free to open **[a\npull request](https://github.com/sio/cirrus-run/pulls)**. That would certainly\nmake my day!\n\nI'm open to dialog and I promise to behave responsibly and treat all\ncontributors with respect. Please try to do the same, and treat others the way\nyou want to be treated.\n\nIf for some reason you'd rather not use the issue tracker, contacting me via\nemail is OK too. Please use a descriptive subject line to enhance visibility\nof your message. Also please keep in mind that public discussion channels are\npreferable because that way many other people may benefit from reading past\nconversations.

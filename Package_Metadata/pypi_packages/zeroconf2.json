Kuchlingi\n* removed all use of word 'Rendezvous' - this is an API change\n\n0.11\n----\n\n* correction to comments for addListener method\n* support for new record types seen from OS X\n  - IPv6 address\n  - hostinfo\n\n* ignore unknown DNS record types\n* fixes to name decoding\n* works alongside other processes using port 5353 (e.g. on Mac OS X)\n* tested against Mac OS X 10.3.2's mDNSResponder\n* corrections to removal of list entries for service browser\n\n0.10\n----\n\n* Jonathon Paisley contributed these corrections:\n\n  - always multicast replies, even when query is unicast\n  - correct a pointer encoding problem\n  - can now write records in any order\n  - traceback shown on failure\n  - better TXT record parsing\n  - server is now separate from name\n  - can cancel a service browser\n\n* modified some unit tests to accommodate these changes\n\n0.09\n----\n\n* remove all records on service unregistration\n* fix DOS security problem with readName\n\n0.08\n----\n\n* changed licensing to LGPL\n\n0.07\n----\n\n* faster shutdown on engine\n* pointer encoding of outgoing names\n* ServiceBrowser now works\n* new unit tests\n\n0.06\n----\n* small improvements with unit tests\n* added defined exception types\n* new style objects\n* fixed hostname/interface problem\n* fixed socket timeout problem\n* fixed add_service_listener() typo bug\n* using select() for socket reads\n* tested on Debian unstable with Python 2.2.2\n\n0.05\n----\n\n* ensure case insensitivty on domain names\n* support for unicast DNS queries\n\n0.04\n----\n\n* added some unit tests\n* added __ne__ adjuncts where required\n* ensure names end in '.local.'\n* timeout on receiving socket for clean shutdown\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nLGPL, see COPYING file for details.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/maciekweryszko/python-zeroconf", "keywords": "Bonjour,Avahi,Zeroconf,Multicast DNS,Service Discovery,mDNS", "license": "LGPL", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "zeroconf2", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zeroconf2/", "platform": "unix", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zeroconf2/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/maciekweryszko/python-zeroconf"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zeroconf2/0.19.2/", "requires_dist": ["netifaces (!=0.10.5)"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Pure Python Multicast DNS Service Discovery Library(Bonjour/Avahi compatible, Python 2.7 supported Fork)", "version": "0.19.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            python-zeroconf (Fork of last Python 2.x supported version)<br>===============<br><br>For original: <br>* PyPI page https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zeroconf<br>* GitHub project https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf<br><br>Changelog<br>=========<br>0.19.2<br>------<br>* Bugfix: allow underscores in instance name prefix (RFC 6763 -

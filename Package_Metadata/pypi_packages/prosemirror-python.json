Install with `pip install prosemirror`\n\n2. In your python code, import the two included functions with:\n\n\n    from prosemirror import create_doc, transform_doc\n\n3. Then create a Document object:\n\n    doc = create_doc(doc_data, spec_data) # spec_data = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(view.state.schema.spec))\n\n\n4. Thereafter create an updated Document object with the given steps applied:\n\n    updated_doc = transform_doc(steps_data, doc)\n\n5. To get the JSON version of a Document object, simply use the builtin toJSON method:\n\n    updated_doc.toJSON()\n\n\nSpeed\n-----------\n\nIt is not setting any speed records so far. These tests were conducted with Python 2 with the test files in the repo (applying three steps to an existing doc):\n\n    prosemirror-python: 0.024s\n    \n    nodejs: 0.00013s\n    \n    jsonpatch (Python): 0.00024s\n\nSo it is around 200 times slower than nodejs and 100 times slower than using jsonpatch. It is possible that it could be sped up in various ways, for example by using pypy and a vm or alike. Please let me know if you figure something out!\n\nLicense questions\n-----------\n\n**Q - What license is this under?**\n\nA - AGPL-3, check the LICENSE file.\n\n\n**Q - I have spent the past month building a webbased text editing app. I am in stealth\nmode as my editor is really unique and I'll be the next IT Billionaire once I\nrelease it. Now I would like to use this library, but the AGPL requires me to share\nchanges I make with others! It's not fair that you are standing between me and my fortune!**\n\nA - Right.

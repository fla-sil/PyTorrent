The vulnerability\n  discussed there affects Plone 2.5 and greater.\n* Applies security declarations and removal of docstrings to some additional\n  methods that were identified by the Plone security team in an audit following\n  the identification of CVE 2011-0720. This includes some methods present in Plone\n  2.0 and 2.1.\n* If necessary, applies a patch to the ZPublisher to fix an issue with the checking\n  of whether traversed methods are publishable.

It merely fixes an issue that prevented respecting placefully\nassigned roles in some cases. Therefore it is an optional upgrade unless you've\nexperienced this issue.\n\n- Protect methods with PermissionRoles rather than hardcoded lists of roles, so\n  that Zope will respect placeful assignments of roles to permissions.\n  [davisagli]\n\n- Clarify the info that is printed on startup so that people don't worry about\n  the fact that their Zope versions wasn't identified.\n  [davisagli]\n\n1.1 (2011-02-08)\n----------------\n\nNote: This release does not provide additional security compared to the 1.0\nrelease. It merely fixes 2 installation issues. If 1.0 installed fine for you,\nyou do not need to update.\n\n- Try 2 ways to delete the docstring as we had one report of the way we were\n  using not working (thanks Andrew Mleczko for the report).\n  [davisagli]\n\n- Fix issue with application to some recent revisions of Zope 2.10.

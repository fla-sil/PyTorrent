Status](https://travis-ci.com/vkbo/novelWriter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/vkbo/novelWriter)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/vkbo/novelWriter/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/vkbo/novelWriter)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/novelwriter/badge/?version=latest)](https://novelwriter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\nnovelWriter is a markdown-like text editor designed for writing novels and larger projects of many smaller plain text documents.\n\nThe documentation is available here: [novelwriter.readthedocs.io](https://novelwriter.readthedocs.io/).\n\n### Note\n\nThe application is under initial development, and not all planned features are included.\nThe core functionality is, however, in place and has been used for a while by the author and collaborators.\n\nNew features are being added regularly, until the core toolset is complete.\nWhen all planned initial features are in place, a release 1.0 will be made.\nUntil then, novelWriter is in a pre-release alpha state, and should be considered experimental.\nIf you do use it for real projects, please run backups frequently to avoid data losses.\nThere is a built in backup feature that can pack the entire project into a zip file on close.\nPlease check the documentation for further details.\n\n## Markdown Flavour\n\nnovelWriter is **not** a full-feature Markdown editor.\nIt allows for a minimal set of formatting needed for writing text documents for novels.\nThese are currently limited to:\n\n* Headings level 1 to 4 using the `#` syntax only.\n* Bold, italic and underline text.\n* Hard line breaks using two or more spaces at the end of a line.\n\nThat is it.\nFeatures not supported in the editor are also not exported when using the export tool.\n\nIn addition, novelWriter adds the following, which is otherwise not supported by Markdown:\n\n* A line starting with `%` is treated as a comment and not rendered on exports unless requested.\n  Comments do not count towards the word count.\n* A set of meta data keyword/value sets starting with the character `@`.\n  This is used for tagging and inter-linking documents.\n* Non-breaking spaces are supported as long as your system is using at least Qt 5.9.\n  For earlier version, non-breaking spaces are converted to normal spaces when saving the document.\n  This is done by the Qt library.\n* Tabs may be rendered, depending on export format.\n\nThe core export format that should render properly all supported features is the HTML export.\nThis format also forms the basis of conversion to Office type document formats with Pandoc.\nNote that Pandoc itself strips some formatting from the document during conversion, so the final result may be different than expected.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe application is written in Python3 using Qt5 via PyQt5.\nIt is developed on Linux, but it should in principle work fine on other operating systems as well as long as dependencies are met.\n\nThe application can be started from the source folder with the command:\n```\n./novelWriter.py\n```\n\nIt also takes a few parameters for debugging and such, which can be listed with the switch `--help`.\n\nThere are no launcher icons yet.\nConsult your operating system documentation for how to make those.\nThese will be added at some point, and I would appreciate any assistance from people working on Windows and MacOS as I don't use either of those operating systems.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nFor the apt package manager on Debian systems, the following Python3 packages are needed:\n\n* `python3-pyqt5` for the GUI\n* `python3-pyqt5.qtsvg` may need to be installed separately\n* `python3-lxml` for writing project files\n\nThese are optional, but recommended:\n\n* `python3-enchant` for better spell checking\n* `python3-latexcodec` for escaping unicode characters in LaTeX export\n* `python3-pandoc` for additional exports to Word, Open Office, eBooks, etc.\n\nAlternatively, the packages can be installed with `pip` by running\n```\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nin the application folder.\n\nYou can also do them one at a time, skipping the ones you don't need:\n```\npython3 -m pip install pyqt5\npython3 -m pip install lxml\npython3 -m pip install pyenchant\npython3 -m pip install latexcodec\npython3 -m pip install pypandoc\n```\nOn Windows,`pyenchant` may cause problems.\nIf no external spell checking tool is installed, novelWriter will use a basic spell checker based on standard Python package `difflib`.\nCurrently, only English dictionaries are available, but more can be added to the `nw/assets/dict` folder.\nSee the RADME.md file in that folder for how to generate more dictionaries.\nThis option is both slow and limited.\n\nNote: On Windows, make sure Python3 is in your PATH if you want to launch novelWriter from command line.\nYou can also right click the `novelWriter.py` file, create a shortcut, then right click again, select \"Properties\" and change the target to your python executable and `novelWriter.py`.\n\nIt should look something like this:\n```\nC:\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\python.exe novelWriter.py\n```\n\n## Key Features\n\nThe text documents of novelWriter uses a format similar to markdown, but with a few extensions and a few omissions.\nProject meta data is stored as XML.\n\n### Colour Themes\n\nThe editor has syntax highlighting for the features it supports, and includes a set of different syntax highlighting themes.\nThe GUI also has an optional dark theme in addition to the default system theme.\n\nNote that the dark theme may not render all elements of the GUI as dark colours if you are running an early version of Qt5.\nThis is not due to a bug in novelWriter, but due to the fact that the the styling options in the Qt API in some versions were incomplete.\n\nNew themes can easily be added to the `nw/themes` folder.\nHave a look in the existing folders for examples of how to define the colours.\n\n### Auto-Saving and Document Stats\n\nOpen documents and the project file itself is saved regularly on a timer if they have been altered.\nThe status of this is indicated by two indicators in the right corner of the status bar.\nUnsaved changes are in yellow, and saved is indicated by green.\nLatest character count, word count, and paragraph count is shown next to these indicators in the status bar.\nThe counts are updated regularly, but not as-you-type.\n\n### Easy Organising of Project Files\n\nThe structure of the project is shown on the left hand side of the main GUI.\nProject files are organised into root folders, indicating what class of file they are.\nThe most important root folder is the Novel folder, which contains all of the files that makes up the finished novel.\nEach root folder can have subfolders.\nFolders have no impact on the project structure, they are purely tools for organising the files in whatever way the user needs.\n\nThe editor supports four levels of headings, which determines what level the following text belongs to.\nHeadings of level one signify a book or partition title.\nHeadings of level two signify the start of a new chapter.\nHeadings of level three signify the start of a new scene.\nHeadings of level four can be used internally in each scene to separate sections.\n\nEach novel file can be assigned a layout format, which shows up as a flag next to the item in the tree view.\nThese are mostly to help the user see what they contain, but some of them have impact on the format of the exported document.\nSee the documentation for further details.\n\n#### Project Notes\n\nSupporting note files can be added for the story plot, characters, locations, story timeline, etc.\nThese have their separate root folders.\nThese are optional files.\n\n### Visualisation of Story Elements\n\nThe different notes can be assigned tags, which the novel files can refer back to using special meta keywords.\nCurrently, this information can be used to display a Timeline View of the story, showing where each scene connects to the plot, and which characters, etc. occur in them.\nFurther features using this meta data will be added in the future.\n\n## Contribution\n\nIf you ant to contribute to novelWriter, please follow the coding convention laid out in the [Style Guide](docs/markdown/style.md).\nThey broadly follow Python PEP8, but there are a few modifications.\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Screenshot 1](docs/source/images/screenshot.png)\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null,

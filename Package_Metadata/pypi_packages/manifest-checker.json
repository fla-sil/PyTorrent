Typically it is intended to be\r\nused to confirm that a directory structure can be deployed/copied in a consistent way from a source to a target.\r\n\r\nThere is a two step process for confirming consistency :\r\n\r\n1. A manifest is created (using the `manifest create` command). This command scans the directory tree, looking for known source code files. A manifest file is created, which is a simple text file listing every source code file found, and a checksum/hash for each file - thus recording a reasonable mark of the file contents.\r\n\r\n2. Following deployment of the directory tree (including the manifest file), the manifest can be checked against the deployed copy, by executing the `manifest check` command. This command scans the directory tree, looking for the source code files, and checking the found files against the manifest file is created. During this check 3 types of exception can be reported :\r\n\r\n   - mismatched files - where the signature of the deployed file is not the same as that in the manifest file\r\n   - missing files - where files are listed in the manifest but not in the deployed directory tree\r\n   - extra files - where files exist in the deployed directory tree but don't exist in the manifest file\r\n\r\nThe toolset was initially designed to check a deployment of a Django based website, and therefore many of the defaults are set for DJango projects including : The source files to look for, and also which sub-directories to ignore.

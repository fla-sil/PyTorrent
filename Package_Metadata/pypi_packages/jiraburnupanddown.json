it\u2019s valuable to see progress when tasks are completed instead of only\nwhen user stories are completed.</p>\n<p>For this reason I distribute the points of a story over the sub-tasks and, lacking a points\nfield for sub-tasks in Jira, fill in the number of points in the original estimate field.\nJira may see that field as hours, but I consider it to be points.</p>\n<p>This application follows the same approach and tracks the completion of sub-tasks in Jira.\nIt uses the original estimate field as the size (in points) of a sub-task.</p>\n<p>### No overlap between burnup and burndown</p>\n<p>The point of this application is to show you if there is going to be a conflict between\nfinishing sprint content and spending time on a separate activity counted in hours.</p>\n<p>This only works if the query for burnup tasks (specified in the connection dialog) does\nnot return any of the sub-tasks that are part of the sprint.</p>\n<p>##

The license is Public Domain!\r\nA: Right. Public Domain is the way software lives, money is the way to live for humans. Nobody wants to end like PKWARE founder. This action [2] will save your soul. For a few months anyway. So try recurring stuff [3].\r\n\r\nQ: Do you mean I have to pay for bablos?\r\nA: No, you don't. But this is how it works - you pay, and then you're hooked. Even if this is the first application you ever payed for, once you pay - it's already installed. You can remove it though.\r\n\r\nQ: Why are you constantly talking about money? What is this stuff anyway?\r\nA: Well, sometimes live becomes harsh and you need bablos to proceed.\r\n\r\nQ: I don't understand.\r\nA: That's not a question.\r\n\r\nQ: That's not an answer.\r\nA: Ok.

It is a site with Python packages!\r\nA: Religion packed into cute Python package.\r\n\r\nQ: I am already a follower of another religion.\r\nA: That's perfectly ok. Bablos is a cooperative religious thing. No matter which religion you follow, bablos helps to keep you up.\r\n\r\nQ: And what it is about?\r\nA: It is about attaining piece of mind through self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you're capable.

That's $245.8 And you said Open Source and Public Domain!\r\nA: I see you're starting to get it. Bablos is OS, PD and about investments. Start investing now to become master [9].\r\n\r\nQ: But what I am investing into?\r\nA: It is not a fraud. That alone should be enough. There is more. There is no promises, so everything is honest.\r\n\r\nQ: But you promised to save me in the ChangeLog.\r\nA: That's planned.\r\n\r\nQ: But you said no promises.\r\nA: No bablos - no promises.

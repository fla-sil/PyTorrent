The\nprocedure allows Web applications to authenticate users through their Google accounts. For\nsecurity reasons, the application acquires an authentication token which will later be used\nto dowload or upload documents from Google servers without explicitly providing the user's\ncredentials. The Plone user is redirected to a Google page that invites him to insert his\ncredentials. Once he logs in with his Google account, the user is asked to authorize the\nPlone application to access his documents. Then, if the user grants access, he is pointed\nagain to the Plone site. The URL of the last redirection embeds the authentication token\nwhich, as mentioned above, allows the Plone application to access the user's documents on\nGoogle servers for the following requests.\n\nGA inititates the authentication procedure upon Google Docs immediately after the user has\nlogged into the Plone application. The procedure will be executed just once, as when the\nPlone application obtains the authentication token, it will store as an attribute, \ngoogle_token, in the user profile.\n\n\nCopyright and license\n---------------------\n\nCopyright (c) 2009 Federica D'Elia\n\nThis software is subject to the provisions of the GNU General Public License,\nVersion 2.0 (GPL).

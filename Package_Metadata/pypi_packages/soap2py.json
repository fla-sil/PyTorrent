Initially it was inspired by `PHP\nSoap Extension <http://php.net/manual/en/book.soap.php>`__ (mimicking\nits functionality, simplicity and ease of use), with many advanced\nfeatures added.\n\n**Supports Python 3** (same codebase, no need to run 2to3)\n\nGoals\n-----\n\n-  Simple: originally less than 200LOC client/server concrete\n   implementation for easy maintainability and enhancements.\n-  Flexible: adapted to several SOAP dialects/servers (Java Axis, .Net,\n   WCF, JBoss, \"jetty\"), with the posibility of fine-tuning XML request\n   and responses\n-  Pythonic: no artifacts, no class generation, no special types, RPC\n   calls parameters and return values are simple python structures\n   (dicts, list, etc.)\n-  Dynamic: no definition (WSDL) required, dynamic generation and\n   parsing supported (cached in a pickle file for performance,\n   supporting fixing broken WSDL)\n-  Easy: simple xml manipulation, including basic serialization and raw\n   object-like access to SOAP messages\n-  Extensible: supports several HTTP wrappers (httplib2, pycurl,\n   urllib2) for special transport needs over SSL and proxy (ISA)\n-  WSGI compilant: server dispatcher can be integrated to other python\n   frameworks (web2py, django, etc.)\n-  Backwards compatible: stable API, no breaking changes between\n   releases\n-  Lightweight: low memory footprint and fast processing (an order of\n   magnitude in some situations, relative to other implementations)\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nClient initially developed for AFIP (Argentina's IRS) web services:\nelectronic invoice, tax bonus, insurance, foreing trade, agriculture,\ncustoms, etc. (http://code.google.com/p/pyafipws/wiki/ProjectSummary)\n\nNow it has been extended to support other webservices like Currency\nExchange Control and TrazaMed (National Traceability of Medical Drugs\nProgram)\n\nAlso, includes Server side support (a generic dispatcher, in order to be\nexposed from web2py service framework, adaptable to other webservers,\nincluding examples for standalone WSGI and django)\n\nSource Code originally available on\n`GoogleCode <https://code.google.com/p/pysimplesoap>`__\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\nRecent changes (2014/2015):\n\n-  Plug-in system to support for WSSE (Web-Services Security extensions)\n-  WSSE UsernameToken, UsernameDigestToken and BinaryTokenSignature\n   support\n-  Pythonic XML Security Library basic implementation (canonicalization,\n   SHA1 hashing and RSA signing / verification using X509 digital\n   certificates)\n-  Improved SOAP Fault details\n-  Several fixes (basic python3 support, CDATA, )\n\nOngoing efforts:\n\n-  Unit Tests update & clean up (removing old tests, better framework,\n   fixing non-deterministic results, etc.)\n-  WSDL advanced support (unifying nested elements structure dialects)\n-  Python3 support for WSSE XMLSec (M2Crypto alternatives?)\n-  Source code refactory to improve readability and maintainability\n\nPrevious contributed features (circa 2013, forked and merged back):\n\n-  Corrected support for multiple SOAP ports/bindings\n-  Support for both ``import`` and ``include`` stanzas in WSDL\n-  Support for a WSDL base directory to deal with relative pathnames in\n   import/include stanzas\n-  Somewhat saner traceing/logging (traces now go to log.debug(), which\n   you can handle per module)\n-  Somewhat more readable logic (by removing a bunch of helpers to a\n   separate file)\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nUsing Python 2.7+:\n\n::\n\n    python -m unittest discover\n\nUsing older Python versions:\n\n::\n\n    python -m unittest tests/suite.py\n\nCode coverage:\n\n::\n\n    sudo pip install coverage\n    coverage run tests/suite.py\n    coverage report -m \n    coverage html\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nFor community support, please fell free to fill an\n`issue <https://github.com/pysimplesoap/pysimplesoap/issues/new>`__ or\nsend a email

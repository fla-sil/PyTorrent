Django_ (obviously).\n#. Boto_, the python frontend to AWS\n\n.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.com\n.. _Boto: http://code.google.com/p/boto/\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nGetting django-scrup can be as easy as::\n\t\n\t$ pip install django-scrup\n\nin your favorite shell.\n\nIf you prefer to pull down and install the package yourself, you can always download or\ncheckout the `latest release`_ and install via the usual ``python setup.py install``.\n\n.. _`latest release`: http://github.com/idangazit/django-scrup\n\nConfiguration and Usage\n=======================\n\nFirst, add ``'scrup'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``. Don't forget to ``./manage.py syncdb``!\n\nYou'll also need to define a few values in your ``settings.py``:\n\n``SCRUP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY``\n\tYour AWS access key.\n\n``SCRUP_AWS_SECRET_KEY``\n\tYour AWS secret key.\n\n``SCRUP_AWS_BUCKET``\n\tThe bucket in which django-scrup should store the uploaded screenshots. This must\n\tbe a bucket which is writeable by the AWS user identified by the above credentials.\n\tThis bucket should be **solely devoted to the use of django-scrup**, as the app will\n\tlikely barf if it tries to upload a file with the same name as an existing file.\n\tBy default, the uploaded files are stored in the root of the bucket, unless\n\t``SCRUP_AWS_PREFIX`` is specified.\n\n``SCRUP_AWS_PREFIX``\n\t**Optional.**\n\tA relative pathname to a folder within the bucket. If this value is specified,\n\tuploads will be copied to ``http://yourbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/<SCRUP_AWS_PREFIX>``\n\n``SCRUP_AWS_CNAME``\n\t**Optional.**\n\tA boolean value indicating whether to use the bucketname as the domain of the\n\treturned screenshot URL. If you've created a CNAME for your bucket, set this to\n\t``True`` and the returned URLs will be of the form ``http://<BUCKETNAME>/foo`` vs.\n\t``http://<BUCKETNAME>.s3.amazonaws.com/foo``.\n\nNext, make sure to import ``django-scrup``'s urls. A line like the following in your\n``urls.py`` should do the trick::\n\n    (r'^scrup/', include('scrup.urls')),\n\nFinally, plug the URL into Scrup's configuration. Obviously, this depends on your\nserver's domain and how you've chosen to setup ``django-scrup``'s urls. By default,\n``django-scrup`` accepts uploads at ``upload/<FILENAME>``, where ``<FILENAME>`` is\noptional. Here's an example of the default URL scheme for ``mydomain.com``::\n\n\thttp://mydomain.com/scrup/upload/{filename}\n\nLicense\n=======\n\ndjango-scrup is made available under the terms of the `new BSD license`_.

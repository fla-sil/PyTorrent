Site visitors can create topics\n(subjects or questions) and add comments to existing\ntopics.\n\n\nUsing Silva Forum\n=================\n\nAfter enabling the Silva Forum extension you can create a *Silva\nForum* content in the Silva Management Interface: this will be the\nforum. The public interface of the Forum allows site visitors to add\ntopics (subjects) to the forum, and comments (messages) to the\ntopics. The topics and comments are accessible from the management\ninterface by site editors for editing and moderation purposes.\n\nManaging Access\n===============\n\nConsulting the forum\n--------------------\n\nBy default, the forum, topic and comments are viewable by\nunauthenticated people like any other Silva content. If you wish to\nrestrict this, you can use the default access restriction feature of\nSilva to do so (located in the management interface, in the access tab).\nFor more information about this, please consult the Silva user\ndocumentation.\n\nPosting new topics and comments\n-------------------------------\n\nBy default you need to be authenticated to be able to post a topic or\na comment.\n\nFor unauthenticated visitors, a link on a forum or a topic will let\nthem authenticate in order to be able to post.\n\nA site manager can, per forum or per topic, authorize unauthenticated\npeople to post. This is configured in the management interface in\nthe settings screen of the properties tab). If this option is\nactivated, unauthenticated site visitors will be able to post new\ntopic or comments after filling in a Captcha.\n\nThe ``silva.pas.openid`` package can be installed in order to provide\nauthentication via OpenID. This authentication will be sufficient to let\nsite visitors post on forums and topics.\n\nAnother option, anonymous posting, can be activated by site managers\non the same screen as the unauthenticated posting. It will permit\nauthenticated visitors to hide their names on the topic or comment\nthey posted.\n\nNotification\n============\n\nA site manager can, per forum or per topic, activate a subscription\nfeature. If activated, this will allow visitors, after subscription, to\nreceive notifications by email when a new comment is posted on a topic.\n\nIf you email is known (i.e. you filled it in in Silva, or it was provided\nby your OpenID provider), you will have the possibility to directly\nsubscribe yourself to a topic when you post it, or to a topic when you\npost a comment in it.\n\nOf course people can cancel their subscription when they wish to.\n\nThis feature is provided by ``silva.app.subscriptions``. To have it,\nyou need to enable subscriptions for the forum, just like you would\ndo for other Silva content. For more information about the\nsubscription feature, you can consult the Silva user documentation.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nMany thanks to Bas Leeflang and the Bijvoet Center\nhttp://www.bijvoet-center.nl/ for the assignment to build the forum.\n\nThank you Mark James of http://www.famfamfam.com/ for the great icons,\nwhich we used in the forum views!

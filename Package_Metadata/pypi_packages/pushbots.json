The module, the tests and the\n  examples work for both python 2 and python 3 versions.\n| Current \"pushbots\" module supports all of the pushbots API calls.

This means that a token is needed to perform those API calls\nand since this module is reserved for backends, you, normally, won't be\nusing those API calls. Though you can retrieve device tokens based on\nalias, tags, etc through devices info (see\nexamples/get\\_token\\_from\\_alias.py and examples/location.py,\nexamples/unregister.py for more info):\n\nThere is also a second list of generic API calls, for calls not listed\nin the first list.

If you don't want to install it,\nyou can manually copy the \"pushbots\" package into your project. There\nare two ways to install \"pushbots\".\n\n- With pip: ``pip install pushbots``\n- Manually: Go to `releases <https://github.com/tchar/pushbots/releases>`__ and download\n  the latest version. Extract the compressed file, navigate to project's\n  root directory and run: ``python setup.py install``\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\n| For \"pushbots\" to work, python \"requests\" must be installed. If you\n  already have \"setuptools\" installed and choose to install \"pushbots\"\n  from pip or setup.py, you don't have to manually install \"requests\".\n  On any other case, you must install it manually:\n| http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install requests\n\nHow to use\n----------\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from pushbots import Pushbots\n    # Your code\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nYou can find examples under pushbots/examples directory. If there is an\nAPI call missing from the first list mentioned above, you can view the\nexamples/generic.py examples, on how to make custom API calls, listed in\nthe second list mentioned (put, post, get). If you want to perform token\noperations, you can use the examples/get\\_token\\_from\\_alias.py to get\nthe devices tokens and platforms associated with a specific alias. Also\nthe files, examples/location.py and examples/unregister.py make use of\ntokens to make an API call, whereas all the other files in examples make\nuse of alias, tags etc for the API calls.\n\nTests\n-----\n\nThe tests package is located under pushbots directory. Tests create\nvirtual devices to test the API calls provided by \"pushbots\" module. You\ncan run the tests by typing:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    python -m pushbots.tests.run\n\nIf you want help on how to run tests, type:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    python -m pushbots.tests.run -h", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/tchar/pushbots/releases", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/tchar/pushbots", "keywords": "pushbots,push,push notifications,gcm,google cloud messaging", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "pushbots", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pushbots/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pushbots/", "project_urls": {"Download": "https://github.com/tchar/pushbots/releases", "Homepage": "https://github.com/tchar/pushbots"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pushbots/0.0.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "REST API library for pushbots.", "version": "0.0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div>\n<div>A python 2/python 3 REST API library module (wrapper) for\n<a href=\"https://pushbots.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pushbots</a>.

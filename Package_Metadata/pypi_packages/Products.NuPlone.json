If you want to learn\n  about CSS and Plone, this is a great starting point.\n  \n- It's an example of a static layout as opposed to the fluid layout of\n  default Plone.\n  \n- It is logically grouped and well-commented.\n\n- It's much smaller (~25K uncompressed!)\n\nTips\n====\n\nNuPlone is a bit different from the standard theme, and the following tweaks\nwill help you get closer to what the designers intended:\n\n- Add the search portlet as the topmost portlet in the left column.\n\n- Turn off icon display in \"Theme settings\".\n  \nCaveats\n=======\n\nBeing a new theme, this hasn't received the amount of testing and quality\nassurance that has gone into the default Plone theme over the years, so we\nsuspect there are bugs in various browsers, especially in Internet Explorer.\n\nIt is also implemented on top of the standard table-for-layout setup in the\ndefault theme - please note that it's easy to make this theme tableless if\nyou should wish to do so.

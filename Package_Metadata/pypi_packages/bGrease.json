The component-based architecture allows games to be constructed\nbit by bit with built-in separation of concerns. The engine acknowledges that\nall game projects are unique and have different requirements. Thus bGrease does\nnot attempt to provide one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead it provides\npluggable components and systems than can be configured, adapted and extended\nto fits the particular needs at hand.\n\nThe goals of the project include:\n\n* Making Python game development faster and more fun by allowing the developer\n  to focus on creating their game rather than getting bogged down in\n  architecture, low-level apis and adapting ill-fitting tools together.\n\n* To provide pluggable and extensible parts that implement first-class\n  techniques and algorithms that can be leveraged for many projects.\n\n* To fully document the engine and provide examples that demonstrate best\n  practices for others to base their projects on.\n\n* To facilitate outside contribution of parts and ideas into the framework\n  that have proven useful in the wild.\n\n* To provide optional native-code optimized parts for maximum performance,\n  but also provide equivalent parts coded in pure Python for ease\n  of installation and distribution.\n\nNot all of these goals have been realized yet, but I feel the project is well\non their path.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nbGrease is distributed under a permissive MIT-style open source license. This\nlicense permits you to use grease for commercial or non-commercial purposes\nfree of charge. It makes no demands on how, or whether, you license, or\nrelease the code derived from or built upon bGrease, other than preservation of\ncopyright notice.\n\nFor a complete text of the license see the ``LICENSE.txt`` file in the source\ndistrbution.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nbGrease is platform-independent and should run on any operating system\nsupporting Python and Pyglet.\n\nThe following are required to build and install bGrease:\n\n* Python 2.6 or higher(http://www.python.org/)\n\nIf using the pyglet modules:\n* Pyglet 1.1 (http://www.pyglet.org/) \n\nDownloading bGrease\n-------------------\n\nYou can clone the github repository to get the very latest code:\n\n\tgit clone git@github.com:Beliaar/bGrease.git\n\nAlthough there is no guarantee that the latest master branch code will work\nperfectly, or even make it to release, efforts are made to ensure bGrease is\nfunctional at each push.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install bGrease from the source distribution or repository use::\n\n    python2.6 setup.py install\n\nOnce installed you can try it out by running the unit tests and the\nincluded example game, but make sure you leave the grease source directory\nfirst or they will not work properly::\n\n\tcd\n\tpython2.6 -m grease.test.run_all\n\tpython2.6 -m grease.examples.blasteroids3\n\nNote on some platforms, such as MacOS X, you will need to use ``pythonw2.6``\nto run the tests and example game.\n\nNote, you can also try out bGrease without installing it by setting your\n``PYTHONPATH`` to the source directory::\n\n\texport PYTHONPATH=`pwd`\n\tpython2.6 test/run_all.py\n\tpython2.6 examples/blasteroids3.py\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nYou can browse the original grease documentation online at:\n\n* http://packages.python.org/grease/\n\nThis does, however, not include changes made by bGrease.\n\nThe documentation, with changes by bGrease, is also available for offline viewing in the\n``doc/build/html`` subdirectory for the source distribution.\n\nDevelopment Status\n------------------\n\nGrease is alpha software under active development. The APIs may change in\nfuture releases, however efforts will be made to minimize breakage between\nreleases.\n\nContributing and Getting Support\n--------------------------------\nNote that this section mainly applies to Grease and not bGrease.\nI don't read the google users group, for example.\n\nCome visit us at the Grease users google group to get help, moral support,\nlavish praise, complain bitterly, report a bug, or contribute ideas:\n\n* http://groups.google.com/group/grease-users\n\nIf you would like to contribute to Grease, feel free to fork the git\nrepository and make a pull request to have your changes reviewed. Note that\nbug fixes must be accompanied by unit tests, and features must also be\ndocumented.

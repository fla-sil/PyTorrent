You display the text, 'Risk of Bias automation by RobotReviewer ([how to cite](http://vortext.systems/robotreviewer))' on the same screen or webpage on which the RobotReviewer results (highlighted text or risk of bias judgements) are displayed.\n2. For web-based tools, the text 'how to cite' should link to our website `http://vortext.systems/robotreviewer`\n3. For desktop software, you should usually link to the same website. If this is not possible, you may alternately display the text and example citations from the 'How to cite RobotReviewer' section below.\n\n## How to cite RobotReviewer\n\nWe offer RobotReviewer free of charge, but we'd be most grateful if you would cite us if you use it. We're academics, and thrive on links and citations!\n\nGetting RobotReviewer widely used and cited helps us obtain the funding to maintain the project and make RobotReviewer better.\n\nIt also makes your methods transparent to your readers, and not least we'd love to see where RobotReviewer is used! :)\n\nYou can cite RobotReviewer as:\n\nMarshall IJ, Kuiper J, & Wallace BC. RobotReviewer: evaluation of a system for automatically assessing bias in clinical trials. Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 2015. [doi:10.1093/jamia/ocv044](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocv044)\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n    @article{RobotReviewer2015,\n      title = {{RobotReviewer: evaluation of a system for automatically assessing bias in clinical trials}},\n      author = {Marshall, Iain J and Kuiper, Jo\\\"{e}l and Wallace, Byron C},\n      doi = {10.1093/jamia/ocv044},\n      url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocv044},\n      journal = {Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association},\n      year = {2015}\n      month = jun,\n      pages = {ocv044}\n    }\n\n## Dependencies\n\nRobotReviewer requires the following libraries:\n\n    sklearn\n    numpy\n    scipy\n    hickle\n    nltk\n\n`nltk` and `sklearn` are not used much, and will be removed in time\n\n\n    pip install numpy scipy sklearn hickle nltk\n\n## Running\n\n`python robot.py` will start a flask server running on `localhost:5000`. You can run the server in development mode by passing `DEBUG=true python robot.py` which will attempt live code reload.\n\n## Running the Web UI\n\nThe optional web interface is provided by [Vortext](http://vortext.systems) [Sp\u00e1](https://github.com/vortext/spa).\nIt can be installed by running the following commands:\n\n```bash\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\npython robot.py\n```\n\nThis retrieves the front-end code, and runs the server.\n\n## Input/output\n\nSend some JSON by POST to /annotate such as:\n```json\n{\"text\": \"Put the full text of a clinical trial in here\"}\n```\n\nand it will return something like:\n\n```json\n{\"marginalia\": [\n   {\"title\":\"Random sequence generation\",\n    \"type\":\"Risk of Bias\",\n    \"description\":\"**Overall risk of bias prediction**: low\",\n    \"annotations\":[\n       {\"content\":\"A central pharmacy randomly assigned study medication in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomization sequence with variable-sized blocks ranging from 2 to 8 stratified by study site.\",\n        \"uuid\":\"6e97f8d0-2970-11e5-b5fe-0242ac110006\"\n       }, ...\n```\n\n## Running as a Python module\n\nWe will add full python module functionality to a future relase. However, the current code can easily be called directly from existing python code as follows:\n\n```python\nimport biasrobot # from the robotreviewer root directory\n\nbot = biasrobot.BiasRobot()\ntext = \"Put the full text of a clinical trial in here...\"\nannotations = bot.annotate(text)\n```\n\nWhere the BiasRobot.annotate() method returns a \"marginalia\" dict of the same structure as the JSON example above.\n\n## Help\n\nFeel free to contact us on [mail@ijmarshall.com](mailto:mail@ijmarshall.com) with any questions.\n\n## More help!\n\nOur tech consultancy [Vortext](http://vortext.systems/) can help get RobotReviewer running on your server for you, or can provide fully-managed RobotReviewer cloud instances; [contact us](http://vortext.systems/hire-us/) for details.\n\n## References\n\n1.

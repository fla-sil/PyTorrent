This project also has limitations around large file transfers,\npeer seeding and python integration.\n\n## Differences from Murder\n\n[Murder](https://github.com/lg/murder) was Twitter's original BitTorrent-based file\ndistribution system. It's pretty dependent on Capistrano and requires that a separate\ntracker process is started before you run the deploy task.\n\nHorde spawns its own tracker in the background which makes it really trivial to integrate into whatever\ndeployment system you like.\n\n## Requirements\n\nHorde needs Python > 2.5 and argparse.  If your using python 2.7+ nothing else is needed as argparse\nwas added to the standard library.\n\nArgparse(if needed) can be installed with easy_install or pip:\n\n    pip install argparse\n    easy_install argparse\n\nHorde also currently requires that key based passwordless authentication is enabled on all of your\ntarget destinations.\n\n## Install\n\n    git clone https://github.com/naterh/Horde\n    cd Horde && sudo python setup.py install\n\nor\n\n    sudo pip install horde\n\n## Usage\n\nWith a hosts file that includes a list of the hosts you want to copy to:\n\n    horde myfile.tar.gz /path/to/destination.tar.gz hosts_file\n\nUsing a hosts list that is a single string comma separated:\n\n    horde myfile.tar.gz /path/to/destination.tar.gz --hostlist \"host1,host2,host3\"\n\nMore options:\n\n    horde --help\n\n## Python Integration\n\nHorde can also be imported as a python module.  This makes integration into existing projects\nmuch more bueno.  One would simply need to:\n\n    import horde.horde as horde\n    horde.run_with_opts('localfile', 'remotefile', hostlist='server1,server2')\n\n## Credits\n\n* [Nate House](https://github.com/naterh)\n* [Russ Garrett](http://github.com/russss)\n* [Laurie Denness](http://github.com/lozzd)", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/naterh/Horde", "keywords": null, "license": "UNKNOWN", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "horde", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/horde/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/horde/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://github.com/naterh/Horde"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/horde/0.1.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Torrent distribution.", "version": "0.1.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>## About</p>\n<p>Horde is a torrent-based file distribution system, forked from [Herd](<a href=\"https://github.com/russss/Herd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/russss/Herd</a>)\nand based on [Murder](<a href=\"https://github.com/lg/murder\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/lg/murder</a>).\nIt allows for quick and easy transfer of small and large files.

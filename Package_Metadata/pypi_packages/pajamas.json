In practice, however, we find that this is rarely done consistently.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn a nutshell, the pajamas package simply strips the jupyter notebook of its output. Additionally, it provides an output-less format using the `.pajamas` extension, which facilitates working with templates from which jupyter notebooks are created. This enables us to block any `.ipynb` files from being committed to a repository (by including the extension to `.gitignore`), which keeps repositories smaller.\n\nWe see jupyter notebooks as a worker having all tools, materials, and results in hand, while the pajamas format retains all of the knowledge and ability (the code) but removes all of the heavy tools, materials, and results (the output contained in the jupyter notebook). Just like the worker would not go to sleep with all of the tools, neither should a jupyter notebook.

No, really.\n\nThere may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not\nready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good\nenough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?\n\nWe assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code at\nall, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open source\nprojects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect code\nisn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's\ntrying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those\nmistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.\n\nBeing an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can\nhelp out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the\nproject (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution\nprocess). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as\na whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see\nthe errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.\n\nNote: This disclaimer was originally written by\n`Adrienne Lowe <https://github.com/adriennefriend>`_ for a\n`PyCon talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uj746j9Heo>`_, and was adapted by\ncosmo_pair_counting based on its use in the README file for the\n`MetPy project <https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy>`_.", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/vcalderon2009/cosmo_pair_counting", "keywords": "", "license": "BSD 3-Clause", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "cosmo-pair-counting", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/cosmo-pair-counting/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/cosmo-pair-counting/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/vcalderon2009/cosmo_pair_counting"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/cosmo-pair-counting/0.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "Package for optimized pair counting", "version": "0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"package-for-optimized-pair-counting\">\n<h2>Package for optimized pair counting</h2>\n<a href=\"http://www.astropy.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Powered by Astropy Badge\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/193fcb7be12e2af08ca8b3d6a84ab5ea9ad746ab/687474703a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f706f776572656425323062792d417374726f50792d6f72616e67652e7376673f7374796c653d666c6174\"></a>\n</div>\n<div id=\"license\">\n<h2>License</h2>\n<p>This project is Copyright (c) Victor Calderon and licensed under\nthe terms of the BSD 3-Clause license.

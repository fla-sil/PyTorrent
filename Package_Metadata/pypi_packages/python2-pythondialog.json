What are its limitations?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs you might infer from the name, dialog is a high-level program that\ngenerates dialog boxes. So is pythondialog. They allow you to build nice\ninterfaces quickly and easily, but you don't have full control over the\nwidgets, nor can you create new widgets without modifying dialog itself.\nIf you need to do low-level stuff, you should have a look at `ncurses`_\n(cf.\u00a0the ``curses`` module in the Python standard library), `blessings`_\nor slang instead. For sophisticated text-mode interfaces, the `Urwid\nPython library`_ looks rather interesting, too.\n\n.. _ncurses: https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.html\n.. _blessings: https://github.com/erikrose/blessings\n.. _Urwid Python library: http://excess.org/urwid/\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* This **now unsupported** backport of pythondialog requires Python\u00a02.6\n  or later in the 2.x series. It has been tested with Python\u00a02.7.\n\n* The reference implementation supports more recent versions of the\n  Python interpreter. Please visit the `pythondialog home page`_ for\n  more information.\n\n* Apart from that, pythondialog requires the dialog_ program (or a\n  drop-in replacement for dialog). You can download dialog from:\n\n    https://invisible-island.net/dialog/dialog.html\n\n  Note that some features of pythondialog may require recent versions of\n  dialog.\n\n\nQuick installation instructions\n-------------------------------\n\nIf you have a working `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_ setup,\nyou should be able to install this backport of pythondialog with::\n\n  pip install python2-pythondialog\n\nWhen doing so, make sure that your ``pip`` executable runs with the\nPython\u00a02 installation you want to install the backport for.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can read the ``INSTALL`` file from a\nrelease tarball. You may also want to consult the `pip documentation\n<https://pip.pypa.io/>`_.\n\n\nBackport-specific notes\n-----------------------\n\n* The pythondialog documentation is written for the reference\n  implementation (Python\u00a03 at the time of this writing). To be on the\n  safe side when using the Python\u00a02 backport, you should use Unicode\n  strings every time you pass \u201cstring data\u201d to pythondialog, and you\n  will get Unicode strings in return. Indeed, these correspond directly\n  to Python\u00a03 strings, and modern versions of pythondialog (>=\u00a02.12) are\n  all based on this type of string.\n\n  The pythondialog documentation consistently uses the term \u201cstring\u201d (as\n  opposed to \u201cUnicode string\u201d) because it has been written for Python\u00a03,\n  but **you should definitely use Unicode strings when using the\n  Python\u00a02 backport**. Many things happen to work with byte strings, but\n  in most cases, this is pure coincidence; others fail, and won't be\n  fixed. This is not a bug.\n\n  The easiest way to use Unicode strings everywhere (or almost\n  everywhere) in Python\u00a02.x with x >= 6, consists in using::\n\n    from __future__ import unicode_literals\n\n  at the beginning of your Python files. This method has the additional\n  benefit of preparing your transition to Python\u00a03.\n\n* Don't use ``str()`` in Python\u00a02 on objects such as pythondialog\n  exceptions or ``dialog.DialogBackendVersion`` instances; use\n  ``unicode()`` instead, which is the Python\u00a02 equivalent of the\n  Python\u00a03 ``str()`` built-in. Of course, using ``repr()`` on any\n  pythondialog object should return a byte string when run under\n  Python\u00a02, because this is how the ``repr()`` API works in Python\u00a02.\n  The same holds true for ``str()``, but this one is not supported by\n  the Python\u00a02 backport of pythondialog: it is superseded, as already\n  explained, by the much more powerful ``unicode()``.\n\n* Before taking potentially expensive decisions, you should realize that\n  Unicode support is *much*, much better in Python\u00a03 than in Python\u00a02,\n  even though the basic types are largely the same (Unicode string in\n  Python\u00a02, native string in Python\u00a03). In Python\u00a03, native strings\n  (simply called \u201cstrings\u201d in the Python documentation) are natural and\n  ubiquitous. They can be read and written from/to the standard I/O\n  streams with sane encoding defaults. ``str()`` and ``repr()`` return\n  native strings, as do all standard library calls whenever expected\n  (i.e., when the return value is text, as opposed to binary data).\n  Python\u00a03 strings are both powerful and easy to use.\n\n  By contrast, in Python\u00a02, you always have to be very careful about\n  what you manipulate: byte strings or Unicode strings. Most library\n  calls in your code are a potential source of bug. Usually, this kind\n  of bug only pops up when user data or input introduces non-ASCII\n  characters in a byte string that is then either combined with an\n  Unicode string, or used in a context where the expected encoding is\n  different. This means that some users get annoyed by \u201ccrappy\u201d\n  software, while the responsible developers are often not aware of any\n  problem---until a bug report is filed, if ever.\n\n  Want to use ``traceback.format_exc()`` for instance? What does it\n  return, byte string or Unicode string? Experiment. Answer: byte\n  string. Then, how does it deal with, e.g., accented characters in an\n  ``OSError`` exception message? Experiment. Answer: it outputs the\n  ``repr()`` representation of an Unicode string that uses backslash\n  escapes for the non-ASCII characters, all of this inside the returned\n  byte string. Conclusion: the messages seen by users will be very ugly\n  and more or less undecipherable for many of them. Does it behave this\n  way in all cases? Tough question. Use the source, Luke...\n\n  With other library calls, you might get non-ASCII characters in a byte\n  string. Then, the question would be: what encoding has been used to\n  encode them, and is there a reliable way to detect it? In many cases,\n  this is not documented and/or depends on parameters under user\n  control, such as the locale settings. Again, you have to waste time\n  figuring out the encoding, and often can't be sure whether your answer\n  is correct in all cases.\n\n  **Bottom line:**\n\n    There are good reasons why the Python developers broke compatibility\n    at such a fundamental level as string management between Python\u00a02\n    and Python\u00a03. Getting Unicode support completely right in Python\u00a02\n    may require more work than porting your code to Python\u00a03. Besides,\n    future maintainance and evolutions of your program will definitely\n    be easier once it is written in Python\u00a03. Think about it.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n**Important:** be sure to read the `Backport-specific notes`_ above.\n\nThe pythondialog Manual\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe pythondialog Manual is written in `reStructuredText`_ format for the\n`Sphinx`_ documentation generator. The HTML documentation for the latest\nversion of pythondialog as rendered by Sphinx should be available at:\n\n  http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/doc/\n\n.. _pythondialog Manual: http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/doc/\n.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html\n.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/\n.. _LaTeX: https://www.latex-project.org/\n.. _Make: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/\n\nThe sources for the pythondialog Manual are located in the ``doc``\ntop-level directory of the pythondialog distribution, but the\ndocumentation build process pulls many parts from ``dialog.py`` (mainly\ndocstrings).\n\n**Note:**\n\n  Generation of the pythondialog Manual with `Sphinx`_ has only been\n  tested, and is only supported with the reference implementation of\n  pythondialog (i.e., currently, on Python\u00a03). As a consequence, the\n  package containing this file may be fine to read or grep through the\n  ``.rst`` files; however, if compilation of said ``.rst`` files with\n  `Sphinx`_ on Python\u00a02 doesn't work, it is not considered a\n  bug---simply download the reference implementation if you want to do\n  that.\n\nTo generate the documentation yourself from ``dialog.py`` and the\nsources in the ``doc`` directory, first make sure you have `Sphinx`_ and\n`Make`_ installed. Then, you can go to the ``doc`` directory and type,\nfor instance::\n\n  make html\n\nYou will then find the output in the ``_build/html`` subdirectory of\n``doc``. `Sphinx`_ can build the documentation in many other formats.\nFor instance, if you have `LaTeX`_ installed, you can generate the\npythondialog Manual in PDF format using::\n\n  make latexpdf\n\nYou can run ``make`` from the ``doc`` directory to see a list of the\navailable formats. Run ``make clean`` to clean up after the\ndocumentation build process.\n\nFor those who have installed `Sphinx`_ but not `Make`_, it is still\npossible to build the documentation with a command such as::\n\n  sphinx-build -b html . _build/html\n\nrun from the ``doc`` directory. Please refer to `sphinx-build`_ for more\ndetails.\n\n.. _sphinx-build: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html\n\n\nReading the docstrings from an interactive Python interpreter\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIf you have already installed pythondialog, you may consult its\ndocstrings in an interactive Python interpreter this way::\n\n   >>> import dialog; help(dialog)\n\nbut only parts of the documentation are available using this method, and\nthe result is much less convenient to use than the `pythondialog\nManual`_ as generated by `Sphinx`_.\n\n\nEnabling Deprecation Warnings\n-----------------------------\n\nThere are a few places in ``dialog.py`` that send a\n``DeprecationWarning`` to warn developers about obsolete features.\nHowever, because of:\n\n  - the dialog output to the terminal;\n  - the fact that such warnings are silenced by default since Python 2.7\n    and 3.2;\n\nyou have to do two things in order to see them:\n\n  - redirect the standard error stream to a file;\n  - enable the warnings for the Python interpreter.\n\nFor instance, to see the warnings produced when running the demo, you\ncan do::\n\n  PYTHONPATH=. python2 -Wd examples/demo.py 2>/path/to/file\n\nand examine ``/path/to/file``. This can also help you to find files that\nare still open when your program exits.\n\n**Note:**\n\n  If your program is terminated by an unhandled exception while stderr\n  is redirected as in the preceding command, you won't see the traceback\n  until you examine the file stderr was redirected to. This can be\n  disturbing, as your program may exit with no apparent reason in such\n  conditions.\n\nFor more explanations and other methods to enable deprecation warnings,\nplease refer to:\n\n  https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\nIf you have a problem with a pythondialog call, you should read its\ndocumentation and the dialog(1) manual page. If this is not enough, you\ncan enable logging of shell command-line equivalents of all dialog calls\nmade by your program with a simple call to ``Dialog.setup_debug()``,\nfirst available in pythondialog 2.12 (the ``expand_file_opt`` parameter\nmay be useful in versions 3.3 and later). An example of this can be\nfound in ``demo.py`` from the ``examples`` directory.\n\nAs of version 2.12, you can also enable this debugging facility for\n``demo.py`` by calling it with the ``--debug`` flag (possibly combined\nwith ``--debug-expand-file-opt`` in pythondialog 3.3 and later, cf.\n``demo.py --help``).\n\n\nUsing Xdialog instead of dialog\n-------------------------------\n\nAs far as I can tell, `Xdialog`_ has not been ported to `GTK+`_ version\n2 or later. It is not in `Debian`_ stable nor unstable (November 30, 2019).\nIt is not installed on my system (because of the GTK+ 1.2 dependency),\nand according to the Xdialog-specific patches I received from Peter\n\u00c5strand in 2004, was not a drop-in replacement for `dialog`_ (in\nparticular, Xdialog seemed to want to talk to the caller through stdout\ninstead of stderr, grrrrr!).\n\n.. _Xdialog: http://xdialog.free.fr/\n.. _GTK+: https://www.gtk.org/\n.. _Debian: https://www.debian.org/\n\nAll this to say that, even though I didn't remove the options to use\nanother backend than dialog, nor did I remove the handful of little,\nnon-invasive modifications that help pythondialog work better with\n`Xdialog`_, I don't really support the latter. I test everything with\ndialog, and nothing with Xdialog.\n\nThat being said, here is the *old* text of this section (from 2004), in\ncase you are still interested:\n\n  Starting with 2.06, there is an \"Xdialog\" compatibility mode that you\n  can use if you want pythondialog to run the graphical Xdialog program\n  (which *should* be found under http://xdialog.free.fr/) instead of\n  dialog (text-mode, based on the ncurses library).\n\n  The primary supported platform is still dialog, but as long as only\n  small modifications are enough to make pythondialog work with Xdialog,\n  I am willing to support Xdialog if people are interested in it (which\n  turned out to be the case for Xdialog).\n\n  The demo.py from pythondialog 2.06 has been tested with Xdialog 2.0.6\n  and found to work well (barring Xdialog's annoying behaviour with the\n  file selection dialog box).\n\n\nWhiptail, anyone?\n-----------------\n\nWell, pythondialog seems not to work very well with whiptail. The reason\nis that whiptail is not compatible with dialog anymore. Although you can\ntell pythondialog the program you want it to invoke, only programs that\nare mostly dialog-compatible are supported.\n\n\nHistory\n-------\n\npythondialog was originally written by Robb Shecter. Sultanbek Tezadov\nadded some features to it (mainly the first gauge implementation, I\nguess). Florent Rougon rewrote most parts of the program to make it more\nrobust and flexible so that it can give access to most features of the\ndialog program. Peter \u00c5strand took over maintainership between 2004 and\n2009, with particular care for the `Xdialog`_ support. Florent Rougon\ntook over maintainership again starting from 2009...\n\n.. \n  # Local Variables:\n  # coding: utf-8\n  # fill-column: 72\n  # End:\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/x-rst", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/", "keywords": "dialog,ncurses,Xdialog,text-mode interface,terminal", "license": "", "maintainer": "Florent Rougon", "maintainer_email": "f.rougon@free.fr", "name": "python2-pythondialog", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/python2-pythondialog/", "platform": "Unix", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/python2-pythondialog/", "project_urls": {"Documentation": "http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/doc/", "Git repository": "https://sourceforge.net/p/pythondialog/code/", "Homepage": "http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/", "Issue tracker": "https://sourceforge.net/p/pythondialog/_list/tickets", "Mailing list": "https://sourceforge.net/p/pythondialog/mailman/", "SourceForge project page": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/pythondialog"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/python2-pythondialog/3.5.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=2.6, <3", "summary": "A Python interface to the UNIX dialog utility and mostly-compatible programs (Python\u00a02 backport)", "version": "3.5.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"easy-writing-of-graphical-interfaces-for-terminal-based-applications\">\n<h2>Easy writing of graphical interfaces for terminal-based applications</h2>\n</div>\n<div id=\"warning\">\n<h2>WARNING</h2>\n<p>This version is a backport of pythondialog to Python\u00a02.

Usually, this kind\nof bug only pops up when user data or input introduces non-ASCII\ncharacters in a byte string that is then either combined with an\nUnicode string, or used in a context where the expected encoding is\ndifferent. This means that some users get annoyed by \u201ccrappy\u201d\nsoftware, while the responsible developers are often not aware of any\nproblem\u2014until a bug report is filed, if ever.</p>\n<p>Want to use <tt>traceback.format_exc()</tt> for instance? What does it\nreturn, byte string or Unicode string? Experiment. Answer: byte\nstring. Then, how does it deal with, e.g., accented characters in an\n<tt>OSError</tt> exception message? Experiment. Answer: it outputs the\n<tt>repr()</tt> representation of an Unicode string that uses backslash\nescapes for the non-ASCII characters, all of this inside the returned\nbyte string. Conclusion: the messages seen by users will be very ugly\nand more or less undecipherable for many of them. Does it behave this\nway in all cases? Tough question. Use the source, Luke\u2026</p>\n<p>With other library calls, you might get non-ASCII characters in a byte\nstring. Then, the question would be: what encoding has been used to\nencode them, and is there a reliable way to detect it? In many cases,\nthis is not documented and/or depends on parameters under user\ncontrol, such as the locale settings. Again, you have to waste time\nfiguring out the encoding, and often can\u2019t be sure whether your answer\nis correct in all cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are good reasons why the Python developers broke compatibility\nat such a fundamental level as string management between Python\u00a02\nand Python\u00a03. Getting Unicode support completely right in Python\u00a02\nmay require more work than porting your code to Python\u00a03. Besides,\nfuture maintainance and evolutions of your program will definitely\nbe easier once it is written in Python\u00a03. Think about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"id1\">\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> be sure to read the <a href=\"#backport-specific-notes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Backport-specific notes</a> above.</p>\n<div id=\"the-pythondialog-manual\">\n<h3>The pythondialog Manual</h3>\n<p>The pythondialog Manual is written in <a href=\"http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reStructuredText</a> format for the\n<a href=\"https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sphinx</a> documentation generator.

An example of this can be\nfound in <tt>demo.py</tt> from the <tt>examples</tt> directory.</p>\n<p>As of version 2.12, you can also enable this debugging facility for\n<tt>demo.py</tt> by calling it with the <tt><span class=\"pre\">--debug</span></tt> flag (possibly combined\nwith <tt><span class=\"pre\">--debug-expand-file-opt</span></tt> in pythondialog 3.3 and later, cf.\n<tt>demo.py <span class=\"pre\">--help</span></tt>).</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"using-xdialog-instead-of-dialog\">\n<h2>Using Xdialog instead of dialog</h2>\n<p>As far as I can tell, <a href=\"http://xdialog.free.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xdialog</a> has not been ported to <a href=\"https://www.gtk.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GTK+</a> version\n2 or later. It is not in <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debian</a> stable nor unstable (November 30, 2019).\nIt is not installed on my system (because of the GTK+ 1.2 dependency),\nand according to the Xdialog-specific patches I received from Peter\n\u00c5strand in 2004, was not a drop-in replacement for <a href=\"https://invisible-island.net/dialog/dialog.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">dialog</a> (in\nparticular, Xdialog seemed to want to talk to the caller through stdout\ninstead of stderr, grrrrr!).</p>\n<p>All this to say that, even though I didn\u2019t remove the options to use\nanother backend than dialog, nor did I remove the handful of little,\nnon-invasive modifications that help pythondialog work better with\n<a href=\"http://xdialog.free.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xdialog</a>, I don\u2019t really support the latter. I test everything with\ndialog, and nothing with Xdialog.</p>\n<p>That being said, here is the <em>old</em> text of this section (from 2004), in\ncase you are still interested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Starting with 2.06, there is an \u201cXdialog\u201d compatibility mode that you\ncan use if you want pythondialog to run the graphical Xdialog program\n(which <em>should</em> be found under <a href=\"http://xdialog.free.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://xdialog.free.fr/</a>) instead of\ndialog (text-mode, based on the ncurses library).</p>\n<p>The primary supported platform is still dialog, but as long as only\nsmall modifications are enough to make pythondialog work with Xdialog,\nI am willing to support Xdialog if people are interested in it (which\nturned out to be the case for Xdialog).</p>\n<p>The demo.py from pythondialog 2.06 has been tested with Xdialog 2.0.6\nand found to work well (barring Xdialog\u2019s annoying behaviour with the\nfile selection dialog box).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div id=\"whiptail-anyone\">\n<h2>Whiptail, anyone?</h2>\n<p>Well, pythondialog seems not to work very well with whiptail.

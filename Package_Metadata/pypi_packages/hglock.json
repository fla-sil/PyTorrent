To enable, add the following to a configuration file::\n\n    [hglock]\n    updatewriteperm = True\n\n  When a repository is cloned, files marked as needing locking\n  (matched by ``.hglocks``) will be checked out read-only. When a file\n  is locked, it will be made writable. When a file is unlocked (with\n  via ``hg unlock FILE`` or ``hg push``), it will be read-only again.\n\n  Thanks to Scott Sturdivant for contributing this feature.\n\n* The update and commit commands use locks implicitly and will now\n  silently ignore a missing or uninitialized lock repository. Before,\n  ``hg update`` would abort if the lock repository was not\n  initialized, it now outputs a warnings that is only shown when\n  ``--verbose`` is used.\n\n* Refactored code for better maintainability.

Before pushing, clients\n  now inspects each outgoing changeset to see if it contains\n  modifications to an unlocked file for which locking is mandatory.\n  The push is aborted if such a changeset is found.\n\n* Make ``hg unlock`` validate the client's changeset the same way ``hg\n  lock`` does. This ensures that a client does not unlock a file\n  before the changesets that modify it have been pushed.\n\n  The primary way to unlock files is now to simply push the changesets\n  that affect the files -- the unlock command can only be used if a\n  file has not been modified since it was locked.\n\n* Disabled ``--force`` flag for ``hg push``. Creating multiple heads\n  on push is then no longer possible. Pushing a new branch is still\n  possible with the ``--new-branch`` flag.\n\n* Fix compatibility with Mercurial 1.9.x.

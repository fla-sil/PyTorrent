many of these topics as part of an integrated course.\n\nTowards that aim, the organization is both *simple* and *complex*.\nThe *simple* part is that the overall sequencing of the main topics is motivated by the data structuring problems, as is evident from the chapter titles.\nThe *complex* part is that many other concepts including problem solving strategies, more advanced python,

Troni.\nThis module reuses some code and is heavily based on the approach taken in that module. \n\n## Usage\nThe installation process below will install a script named `lcm-export` to your binaries folder.\nTo use, run `lcm-export [options] file`.\n\n`file` is the relative path to your lcm log file, and accepts glob references (e.g. use lcmlog_* to generate .mat files for all files beginning lcmlog_)\n\n### LCM-Types\nThis utility requires the python versions of your lcm types to read the log (those generated by `lcm-gen`).\n\nDirect it to the directory containing those files with the `--lcmtypes PATH` option (it will also search all subdirectories).\n\n### Other options:\n- `-p` to generate Python .pkl files\n- `-m` to generate Matlab .mat files (default)\n\n\n## Installation\n### Requirements\nRequires Python 3.6+ and [lcm](https://lcm-proj.github.io) to run, and pip for installation.\n\n### Installation\n1. Clone this repo\n2. cd into the root directory\n3. Run `pip3 install .`\n\n### Uninstallation\nUninstall with `pip3 uninstall lcm-export`\n\n## License\nLCM Log Export Tool is based on code written by G. Troni in their [`lcm-log2smat` module](https://github.com/gtroni/lcm-log2smat),\nwhich itself is based on a script in [libbot2](https://github.com/libbot2/libbot2).\n\n(libbot2)\n\nlibbot2 is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nlibbot2 is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

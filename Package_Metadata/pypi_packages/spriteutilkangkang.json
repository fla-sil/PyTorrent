The label_map array maps each pixel of the image passed to the function to the label of the sprite this pixel corresponds to, or 0 if this pixel doesn't belong to a sprite (e.g., background color).\n\n### Draw Sprite Label Bounding Boxes\n\nDraws the masks of the sprites at the exact same position that the sprites were in the original image. Draws each sprite mask with a random uniform color (one color per sprite mask). Also draws a rectangle (bounding box) around each sprite mask, of the same color used for drawing the sprite mask.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Install packages: pillow (PIL), numpy, python 3.7.4\n\nYou have to install packages above:\n\n```bash\npip install pillow\n```\n\nand\n\n```bash\npip install numpy\n```\n\n### Install New Python 3.7.4\n\nGo to this link and download new python version: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n\n### Install my package\n\n```bash\npip install spriteutilkangkang\n```\n\n## Contact (Author & Maintainer)\n\n- Name: Khang TRAN\n- Email: haphongpk12@gmail.com\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/haphongpk12\n- Phone: (+84) 909 77 8046\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/haphongpk12/Sprite-Sheet", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "Khang TRAN", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "spriteutilkangkang", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/spriteutilkangkang/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/spriteutilkangkang/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/haphongpk12/Sprite-Sheet"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/spriteutilkangkang/1.0.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.7", "summary": "", "version": "1.0.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Sprite Sheet</h1>\n<h2>Project Description</h2>\n<p>A sprite is a small raster graphic (a bitmap) that represents an object such as a character, a vehicle, a projectile, etc.</p>\n<p>Sprites are a popular way to create large, complex scenes as you can manipulate each sprite separately from the rest of the scene.

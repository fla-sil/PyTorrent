industrial experience on data products.\n\nSmartPipeline focuses on simplicity and efficiency in handling data locally,\ni.e. copies of the data are minimized, with the obvious exception of multiprocessing.\n\nThe main point is creating a ``Pipeline`` object,\nsetting the source of data and adding custom defined stages,\nwhich define the operations to perform sequentially on each data item.\n\n- A pipeline can run indefinitely on the source or it can be used to process single items\n- Stages can run concurrently, both on the source or on single asynchronously processed items\n- A

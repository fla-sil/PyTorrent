This\nlibrary is **not compatible with Python 3.6 or older versions**.\n\n### Install from PyPi using `pip`\n\nYou can install this package via pip:\n\n```sh\npip3 install steem-async\n```\n\n### (Alternative) Manual install from Git\n\nIf you don't want to PyPi (e.g. for development versions not on PyPi yet), you can install the \nproject directly from our Git repo.\n\nUnless you have a specific reason to manually install it, you **should install it using pip3 normally**\nas shown above.\n\n**Option 1 - Use pip to install straight from Github**\n\n```sh\npip3 install git+https://github.com/Privex/steem-async\n```\n\n**Option 2 - Clone and install manually**\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository from Github\ngit clone https://github.com/Privex/steem-async\ncd steem-async\n\n# RECOMMENDED MANUAL INSTALL METHOD\n# Use pip to install the source code\npip3 install .\n\n# ALTERNATIVE INSTALL METHOD\n# If you don't have pip, or have issues with installing using it, then you can use setuptools instead.\npython3 setup.py install\n```\n\n\n# Logging\n\nBy default, this package will log anything >=WARNING to the console. You can override this by adjusting the\n`privex.steem` logger instance. \n\nWe recommend checking out our Python package [Python Loghelper](https://github.com/Privex/python-loghelper) which\nmakes it easy to manage your logging configuration, and copy it to other logging instances such as this one.\n\n```python\n# Without LogHelper\nimport logging\nl = logging.getLogger('privex.steem')\nl.setLevel(logging.ERROR)\n\n# With LogHelper (pip3 install privex-loghelper)\nfrom privex.loghelper import LogHelper\n# Set up logging for **your entire app**. In this case, log only messages >=error\nlh = LogHelper('myapp', handler_level=logging.ERROR)\nlh.add_file_handler('test.log')      # Log messages to the file `test.log` in the current directory\nlh.copy_logger('privex.steem')       # Easily copy your logging settings to any other module loggers\nlog = lh.get_logger()                # Grab your app's logging instance, or use logging.getLogger('myapp')\nlog.error('Hello World')\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\nWe're very happy to accept pull requests, and work on any issues reported to us. \n\nHere's some important information:\n\n**Reporting Issues:**\n\n - For bug reports, you should include the following information:\n     - Version of `privex-steem` and `httpx` tested on - use `pip3 freeze`\n        - If not installed via a PyPi release, git revision number that the issue was tested on - `git log -n1`\n     - Your python3 version - `python3 -V`\n     - Your operating system and OS version (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 7)\n - For feature requests / changes\n     - Please avoid suggestions that require new dependencies. This tool is designed to be lightweight, not filled with\n       external dependencies.\n     - Clearly explain the feature/change that you would like to be added\n     - Explain why the feature/change would be useful to us, or other users of the tool\n     - Be aware that features/changes that are complicated to add, or we simply find un-necessary for our use of the tool may not be added (but we may accept PRs)\n\n**Pull Requests:**\n\n - We'll happily accept PRs that only add code comments or README changes\n - Use 4 spaces, not tabs when contributing to the code\n - You can use features from Python 3.4+ (we run Python 3.7+ for our projects)\n    - Features that require a Python version that has not yet been released for the latest stable release\n      of Ubuntu Server LTS (at this time, Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic) will not be accepted. \n - Clearly explain the purpose of your pull request in the title and description\n     - What changes have you made?\n     - Why have you made these changes?\n - Please make sure that code contributions are appropriately commented - we won't accept changes that involve uncommented, highly terse one-liners.\n\n**Legal Disclaimer for Contributions**\n\nNobody wants to read a long document filled with legal text, so we've summed up the important parts here.\n\nIf you contribute content that you've created/own to projects that are created/owned by Privex, such as code or documentation, then you might automatically grant us unrestricted usage of your content, regardless of the open source license that applies to our project.\n\nIf you don't want to grant us unlimited usage of your content, you should make sure to place your content\nin a separate file, making sure that the license of your content is clearly displayed at the start of the file (e.g. code comments), or inside of it's containing folder (e.g. a file named LICENSE). \n\nYou should let us know in your pull request or issue that you've included files which are licensed\nseparately, so that we can make sure there's no license conflicts that might stop us being able\nto accept your contribution.\n\nIf you'd rather read the whole legal text, it should be included as `privex_contribution_agreement.txt`.\n\n# License\n\nThis project is licensed under the **X11 / MIT** license.

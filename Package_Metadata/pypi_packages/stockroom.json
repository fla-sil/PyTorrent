It doesn't have an exhaustive test\nsuite and the APIs could change in backward incompatible way (for good).\n\nWhy\n---\nStockroom exists for three reasons\n\n- Work hand-in-hand with git:\n\nStockroom let git does ``checkout`` and rely on that to move between branches/commits.\nThis allows stockroom to present a very simple and intuitive API collection to the user\nwhile avoiding the need of user learning another set of commands otherwise they'd need.\n\n- Simplify `hangar <https://github.com/tensorwerk/hangar-py>`_ APIs:\n\nHangar is an extensive and reliable tool that allows users to have fine grained control\nfor storing and versioning data without compromising the speed and efficiency.\nEssentially trying to do what git did for source code but for data. But the set of APIs\nhangar provides are also extensive and can be cut short if we can delegate few tasks to\ngit and make certain assumptions.

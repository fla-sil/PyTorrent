The idea was taken from the `Calysto chatbot`_ kernel.\n\nIt has been tested with Jupyter 4.x. The code works with either Python 2.7 \nor Python 3 (tested with Python 3.4)\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe installation process requires two steps:\n\n1. Install the Python package::\n\n     pip install aimlbotkernel\n\n2. Install the kernel into Jupyter::\n\n     jupyter aimlbotkernel install [--user] [--logdir <dir>]\n\nThe ``--user`` option will install the kernel in the current user's personal\nconfig, while the generic command will install it as a global kernel (but\nneeds write permissions in the system directories).\n\nThe ``--logdir`` specifies the default place into which the logfile will be\nwritten (unless overriden at runtime by the ``LOGDIR`` environment variable).\nIf no directory is specified, the (platform-specific) default temporal \ndirectory will be used.\n\nNote that the Jupyter kernel installation also installs some custom CSS; its \npurpose is to improve the layout of the kernel results as they are presented \nin the notebook (but it also means that the rendered notebook will look \nslightly different in a Jupyter deployment in which the kernel has not been \ninstalled, or within an online viewer).\n\nTo uninstall, perform the inverse operations (in reverse order), to uninstall\nthe kernel from Jupyter and to remove the Python package::\n\n     jupyter aimlbotkernel remove\n     pip uninstall aimlbotkernel\n\n\nOperation\n---------\n\nOnce installed, an *AIML Chatbot* kernel will be available in the Notebook\n**New** menu. Starting one such kernel will create a chatbot. The chatbot is\ninitially empty but can be loaded with a couple of predefined DBs (use the \n``%help`` magic for initial instructions).\n\n\nNotebook input is of two kinds:\n\n* Regular text cells are considered human input and are sent to the chatbot,\n  which produces its corresponding output\n* Cells starting with ``%`` contain \"magic\" commands that affect the\n  operation of the kernel (load AIML databases, inspecting/modifying bot\n  state, saving/loading state to/from disk, etc). Use the ``%help`` magic for \n  some instructions, and ``%lsmagics`` to show the current list of defined \n  magics (magics have autocompletion and contextual help).\n\nThe `examples` directory contains a few notebooks showing some of the\nprovided functionality. They can also be seen with `online Notebook viewer`_\n(note that, as said above, they will look slightly different than in a running \nkernel).\n\n\nAIML\n----\n\n`AIML`_ is an XML-based specification to design conversational agents. Its \nmost famous application is ALICE, a chatbot (the DB for the free version of \nALICE is included in this kernel, as it is included in python-aiml)\n\nThe chatbot can load an AIML database (which is basically a bunch of XML\nfiles). It can also define AIML rules on the fly, by using the ``%aiml`` magic\nin a cell.\n\n\n.. _python-aiml: https://github.com/paulovn/python-aiml\n.. _Calysto chatbot: https://github.com/Calysto/calysto_chatbot\n.. _AIML: http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html\n.. _online Notebook viewer: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/paulovn/aiml-chatbot-kernel/blob/master/examples/", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/paulovn/aiml-chatbot-kernel/tarball/v1.0.4", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/paulovn/aiml-chatbot-kernel", "keywords": "AIML,chatbot,IPython,Jupyter,kernel", "license": "3-clause BSD license", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "aimlbotkernel", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/aimlbotkernel/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/aimlbotkernel/", "project_urls": {"Download": "https://github.com/paulovn/aiml-chatbot-kernel/tarball/v1.0.4", "Homepage": "https://github.com/paulovn/aiml-chatbot-kernel"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/aimlbotkernel/1.0.4/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A Chatbot kernel for Jupyter based on pyAIML", "version": "1.0.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>This is a Jupyter kernel that deploys a chatbot, implemented using the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/paulovn/python-aiml\" rel=\"nofollow\">python-aiml</a> package.

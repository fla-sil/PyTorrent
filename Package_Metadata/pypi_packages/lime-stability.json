Both of them range from 0 to 100, where higher values mean that the tested LIME is stable. They are designed to be used together, since each one tests a different concept of stability.\n\nUsing the indices will bring enhanced confidence in LIME's results: the practitioner may find out possible instability in its trained LIME, or he may vouch for its consistency.\n\nTo get a deeper understanding about the approach, we suggest reading the paper [Statistical stability indices for LIME: obtaining reliable explanations\nfor Machine Learning models [1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11757.pdf).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[1] Visani, Giorgio, et al. \"Statistical stability indices for LIME: obtaining reliable explanations for Machine Learning models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.11757 (2020).\n\n## Installation\n\nInstalling through pip package manager:\n\n```bash\npip install lime-stability\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\nList of dependencies:  \n\n* lime\n* statsmodels\n* sklearn\n* numpy\n\n## Types of data to use the indices on\n\nThe stability indices in `lime_stability` are currently available only for tabular data (LimeTabularExplainer class).

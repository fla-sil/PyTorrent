It's purpose is to give points to students and save those points to Edux. In order to tell eduxator what kind of points are you about to give, you should provide some kind of information, such as:\r\n\r\n- course name (e.g. BI-3DT, BI-SAP...)\r\n- what kind of students are we dealing with (e.g. fulltime, parttime)\r\n- what kind of class is happening (e.g. tutorials, labs, lectures, exams)\r\n- what identifier does current class have (e.g. 1, 101...)\r\n- what column in the classification chart are you going to fill this time (such as cv01, tut8...)\r\n\r\nYou can provide that information as command line arguments and eduxator will try to parse all of it's arguments and determine what to do with them. In case you omit some kind, eduxator will ask you interactively or select the only option available (for example when you only have fulltime students in your course, you don't have to specify it). The following command would be perfect::\r\n\r\n    eduxator BI-3DT 3 cv1\r\n\r\nNote that BI-3DT has only fulltime tutorials, so this information is omitted without any harm. Order of the arguments is not important, eduxator will first look for any valid course identifier, then fulltime/parttime etc. In case there are multiple arguments that fit as something, you'll be ask interactively. You can just omit everything and let eduxator ask you what you need::\r\n\r\n    $ eduxator\r\n    Cannot see Edux cookie in ~./.edux.cookie\r\n    Please provide the name and value of your cookie from Edux.

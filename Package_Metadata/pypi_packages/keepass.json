Note, this is not the\nformat used by the KeePass application version 2.x.\n\n## Notes of caution\n\nBefore using this code, understand the its (known) security\nand correctness limitations:\n\n * Unlike the KeePass/KeePassX GUI applications this code makes no\n   attempt to secure its memory.  Input files read in are stored in\n   memory fully decrypted.\n\n * It is quite easy to display the stored passwords in plain text,\n   although the defaults try to avoid this.\n\n * Specifying the master key on the command line will leave traces in\n   your shells history and in the process list.\n\n * While input files are treated as read-only, keep backups of any\n   files written by KeePass/KeePassX until you are assured that files\n   written by this code are usable.\n\n * Key files are not currently supported.\n\n## Prerequisites and Installation\n\nYou will need to install the python-crypto package (providing the\n\"Crypto\" module).  On a well behaved system do:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install python-crypto\n```\n\nIf installing into a [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org) this prerequisite will be installed for you:\n\n```shell\nvirtualenv /path/to/venv\nsource /path/to/venv/bin/activate\ncd python-keepass\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n\n## Command line\n\nThe command line interface is run like:\n\n```shell\nkeepassc [general_options] [command command_options] ...\n```\n\nMultiple commands can be specified and will be executed in order.\nThey operate on an in-memory instance of the database file.  An\nexample, \n\n```shell\nkeepass open -m secret file.kdb \\\n        dump -p -f '%(username)s password is: %(password)s' \\\n        save -m newsecret backup.kdb\n```\n\nOnline help:\n\n```shell\nkeepass -h      # short usage\nkeepass help    # full usage\n```\n\n## Python Modules\n\n### Low level file access\n\n```python\nfrom keepass import kpdb\ndb = kpdb.Database(filename,masterkey)\nprint db   # warning: displayed passwords in plaintext!\n```\n\n# References and Credits\n\n## PyCrypto help\n\n * Main page is found through <http://pycrypto.org/>.

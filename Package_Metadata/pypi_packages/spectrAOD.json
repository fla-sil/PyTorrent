Many researchers have their own \n code for performing these measurements but we set out to create an \n open-source, well-maintained python package for people who didn't want to \n reinvent the wheel. Currently, the package has a limited use case scenario \n for Cosmic Origins Spectrograph data at a redshift of zero, but we hope to \n expand the capabilities of the package in terms of what missions are \n supported, the computation abilities, and visualization for these \n calculations. Stay tuned!\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis package is registered on PyPI and available via `pip`. `pip` \ninstallations will provide the latest version released to PyPI, and is \nsufficient for installing the package. However, in case you would like the \nlatest version, between published releases, we also offer \ninstructions on how to install by cloning the repository. You will need a \nworking, and preferably current version of Anaconda.\n\n##### Make a new environment\n```\nconda create --name <environment_name> python=3.5 <other packages>\n```\n`<other packages>` simply denotes any other packages you may wish to install\n in this environment, such as `stsci` or `notebook`. All required packages \n for `spectrAOD` will be installed as a dependency automatically.\n\nActivate the new environment with:\n```\nconda activate <environment_name>\n```\nWe recommend a short and simple name for the environment such as `spectraod`.\n\n##### Install with `pip` (Latest published release, recommended)\n\nFrom the command line, in your new environment:\n```\npip install spectrAOD==0.0.2\n```\n\nYou can drop the version number and just use the name of the package if you \nwould like the version most recently published. `pip` will also give you \ninstructions on how to upgrade your version if there is a newer published \none available.\n\n##### Clone the repository and install it (Latest version, recommended for developers only)\n\nThis repository has a button near the top where you can click for the link \nto clone or download. Choose the https version unless you have set up an ssh\ntoken for Github. \nMove into the directory that you would like this package to live in, then:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/cmagness/spectrAOD.git\ncd spectrAOD\npip install .\n```\nAlternately, if you are having issues installing with `pip`, you can also \nuse `python setup.py install`.\n\nUsing `spectrAOD`\n-----------------\n\n##### Configuring Settings\n\nIn this repository you will see a file called `sample_settings.yaml`. You \nwill need a settings file to use this package that is of the same format. \nCopy the settings file and rename it as you please, but retain the `.yaml` \nextension. If you've installed via `pip`, you will not be easily able to find this file. Create a `.yaml` file \nand make sure it has the following information in it:\n\n```\ninputs:\n  # string: path to data\n  datadir:\n  # string: path to output directory\n  outdir:\n  # string: path to target list\n  targets:\n\nparameters:\n  # string: instrument\n  instrument:\n  # string: filetype\n  filetype:\n  # int: minimum number for velocity window in km/s\n  vel_min:\n  # int: maximum number for velocity window in km/s\n  vel_max:\n  # string: grating\n  grating:\n\ndefaults:\n  continuum_left: [-450, -300]\n  continuum_right: [300, 450]\n  all_ions: \n```\nYou should leave the `all_ions` field blank to use the list of \"mini_ions\n.csv\" included with the package, unless you wish to provide the path to your\n own list.\n\nFor `spectrAOD` to find this file, you have two options:\n\n###### Set an environment variable (Recommended)\n\nWe recommend creating an environment variable in your `.bashrc` or `\n.bash_profile` to point to this file. To do so, open your `.bashrc` or `\n.bash_profile` in a text editor (this will be a hidden file in your home \ndirectory if you are unfamiliar) and then add the line:\n```\nexport SPECTRAOD_SETTINGS=\"/path/to/your/settings/file\"\n```\nSave and close your `.bash_profile` and then activate these changes with:\n```\nsource .bash_profile\n```\nNow `spectrAOD` will know where to look for your file. If you decide to move\nit, just update the path.\n\n###### Move your copy (Slightly faster)\n\nIf you don't want to mess with setting an environment variable, that is just\n fine. You can move your settings file to the directory you plan to run the \n package from and `spectrAOD` will look for a `.yaml` file if no environment\n  variable is set. Just be warned that it will look for _any_ `.yaml` file.\n\n###### Populating the settings\n\nOnce you've told `spectrAOD` where to find your settings file, be sure to \nactually populate it. Each parameter in the sample file has a comment with \ninformation about what should go into that file. These settings provide \na default for `spectrAOD` to use-don't worry, you can change the value in each \nrun from the command line.\n\n###### Setting a Target List\n\nIn the settings file you will notice one of the parameters asks for the path\nto your target list file. Explicitly, this needs to be a **path to a target \nlist** and **NOT** a list of targets. To perform the LSR correction `spectrAOD` \nneeds a target list that has the RA and DEC. The target name needs to match\nthe name that is used in the file header if you are processing fits files. You\ncan see the format for this file (it must also be a csv at this time) in \nsample_targets.csv. Feel free to use that file to build your target list.\n\n#### Running the package \n\n###### Command line arguments\n\nTo run the default measurements you've put in that file, from the command \nline, in any directory, enter:\n```\nmeasure <ion>\n```\nor, from within the package level:\n```\npython measure_aod.py <ion>\n```\n\nWhere the ion is the name of the ion you wish to measure. Currently, you may\n use any of the ions in the `mini_ions.csv` list, or add your own in the \n same format to that file.\n\nTo see the full list of parameter options, run:\n```\nmeasure --help\n```\n\nThis will give you information about all the parameters you can change from \nthe command line. By default, `spectrAOD` will use the values in your \nsettings file but you can alter any of them from the default by adding the \ncorrect flag at the command line.\n\nSay you perform a measurement of NV in the region from -100 to 100 km/s but \nthen decide it may be advantageous to perform the measurement in the window \nfrom -100 to 150 km/s. You can do this without making changes to your \nsettings file by running:\n```\nmeasure NV --vel_max 150\n```\n\n<!---\n\nContributing Code, Documentation, or Feedback\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\n3rd Party Libraries this package requires\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n---> \n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/cmagness/spectrAOD", "keywords": "astronomy", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "spectrAOD", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/spectrAOD/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/spectrAOD/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/cmagness/spectrAOD"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/spectrAOD/0.0.2/", "requires_dist": ["setuptools", "numpy", "astropy", "pandas", "argparse"], "requires_python": ">=3.5", "summary": "This package is for measuring the apparent optical depth of spectra", "version": "0.0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h2>SpectrAOD</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"spectraod_technique\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/a66e8789dde3057a81a354a7ce83d10e5be2bca7/737065637472616f645f646472665f66696e616c2e706e67\"></p>\n<p><code>spectrAOD</code> is a package for measuring the apparent optical depth, and thus,\nthe apparent column density for spectral absorption features as outlined by\nSavage and Sembach in their 1991 paper.

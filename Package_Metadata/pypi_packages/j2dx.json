If you're not using sudo or user detection fails for another reason, you can provide username as an argument to `--setup`.\nFor udev rules and group changes to take effect you'll have to restart your system.\n\nOn Windows this will download [ViGEmBus driver](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus) and prompt you to install it.\nOnce the driver is setup you can use Joy2DroidX, no restart necessary.\n\n### Regular usage\n\nRun `j2dx` (on windows you can just double click `j2dx.exe`), scan QRCode from the Android app and that's it.\nEverything should just work. Switching device mode is done from the Android app.\n\nThe server should not need any extra configuration.\nIf you have an unsual network setup or default port is used by another process, there are a couple option you can modify:\n\n- `-p, --port` allows you to use a different port. Default is 8013.\n- `-H, --host` if hostname detection fails you can specify a hostname or your computers IP address.\n- `-d, --debug` you shouldn't need this one. If you do encounter bugs, run `j2dx -d` and open an issue with a link to debug output (use a gist or pastebin for this).\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/OzymandiasTheGreat/Joy2DroidX-server", "keywords": "virtual-device,gamepad,controller", "license": "GPL-3.0", "maintainer": "Tomas Ravinskas", "maintainer_email": "tomas.rav@gmail.com", "name": "j2dx", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/j2dx/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/j2dx/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/OzymandiasTheGreat/Joy2DroidX-server", "Repository": "https://github.com/OzymandiasTheGreat/Joy2DroidX-server"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/j2dx/0.1.0/", "requires_dist": ["python-socketio (>=4.2,<5.0)", "eventlet (>=0.25,<0.26)", "qrcode (>=6.1,<7.0)", "colorama (>=0.4,<0.5); sys_platform == \"win32\"", "evdev (>=1.2,<2.0); sys_platform == \"linux\""], "requires_python": ">=3.7,<4.0", "summary": "Use your Android phone as a virtual Xbox 360 controller or DualShock 4 gamepad on your Windows or Linux PC.

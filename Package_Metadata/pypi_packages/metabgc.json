Pre-built high-performance spHMMs exist for cyclases/aromatases commonly found in TII-PKS BGCs (OxyN, TcmN, TcmJ, and TcmI types), LanC_like proteins (found in lantibiotic BGCs), and IucA/IucC proteins (found in siderophore BGCs). If any of these protein families is to be used, this step can be skipped.\n\n**Identify** - ```metabgc identify --help``` -  This module runs on translated metagenomic reads from a cohort of samples using a selected set of high-performance spHMMs and their pre-set score cutoffs, as determined in MetaBGC-Build. The results are parsed into a list of identified biosynthetic reads in fasta format.\n\n**Quantify** - ```metabgc quantify --help``` - This module de-replicates all biosynthetic reads discovered by MetaBGC-Identify from all metagenomic samples in the cohort into a unified set of **unique biosynthetic reads**. An abundance profile martrix is then generated for all unique biosynthetic reads by quantifying them in all samples of the metagenomic cohort.\n\n**Cluster** - ```metabgc cluster --help``` - This module uses Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to cluster unique biosynthetic reads with similar abundance profiles across different metagenomic samples into distinct bins, based on the abundance profile martrix obtained in MetaBGC-Quantify. \n\n**Search** - ```metabgc search --help``` -**NEW** option to run Identify, Quantify, and Cluster together as a single command.  \n\n### Running Build to construct the spHMMs\n\n1. To build and evaluate spHMMs for the protein family of interest, the ```metabgc build``` command has to be executed with required input files. To select high performance spHMMs, a synthetic metagenomic dataset must be generated with reads from true positive genes spiked in to test the performance of each spHMM.\n\n\t```\n    1. --prot_alignment, required=True: Alignment of homologs from the protein family of interest in FASTA format.\n\t2. --prot_family_name, required=True: Name of the protein family. \n         This is used as prefix for spHMM files.\n\t3. --cohort_name, required=True: Name of the cohort of synthetic metagenomic samples used for evaluation.\n\t4. --nucl_seq_directory, required=True: Directory of reads for the synthetic metagenomic samples.

To compute seperately, please see job_scripts in development.\n\t14. --output_directory, required=True: Directory to save results. \n\t15. --cpu, required=False: Number of CPU threads to use (Def.=4). \n\t```\n2. The high-performance spHMMs will be saved in the ```HiPer_spHMMs``` folder in the output directory specified. The ```HiPer_spHMMs``` folder should have the following files:\n\n\t```\n    1. F1_Plot.eps : F1 score plot of all the spHMMs and the F1 cutoff threshold. \n    2. *.hmm : A set of spHMMs that perform above the F1 cutoff threshold.\n    3. <prot_family_name>_F1_Cutoff.tsv: HMM search cutoff scores to be used for each high-performance spHMM interval.\n    4. <prot_family_name>_Scores.tsv: FP, TP and FN scores of the the HMM search for all the spHMMs.\n    5. <prot_family_name>_FP_Reads.tsv: False positive reads in the HMM search but not in the BLAST search. \n    ```\n  \t>**Because synthetic datasets do not fully represent real data, please be aware that some of the spHMM cutoffs may need to be further tuned after running MetaBGC on a real metagenomic dataset, as was done with the Type II polyketide cyclase cutoffs in the original MetaBGC publication.**\n\n\n### Running Identify to detect biosynthetic reads\n\n1. For identifying biosynthetic reads from the protein family of interest using the spHMMs constructed in Build step, the ```metabgc identify``` command should be executed with the required input files. To use our pre-built high-performance spHMMs for cyclases/aromatases commonly found in TII-PKS BGCs (OxyN, TcmN, TcmJ, and TcmI types), LanC_like proteins (found in lantibiotic BGCs), and IucA/IucC proteins (found in siderophore BGCs), please find the high performance input folders [here](https://github.com/donia-lab/MetaBGC/tree/master/MetaBGC-V1/MetaBGC-Build_Outputs).\n\n\t```\n\t1. --sphmm_directory, required=True: The high performance spHMM directory generated from MetaBGC-Build.\n\t2. --nucl_seq_directory, required=True: Directory of reads for the metagenomic samples to be analyzed.

Identify will produce a FASTA file, **identified-biosynthetic-reads.fasta**, comprised of all biosynthetic reads identified in the metagenomic samples of the analyzed cohort, based on the specified cutoffs.\n\n### Running Quantify to de-replicate and quantify biosynthetic reads\n\n1. To de-replicate and quantify the biosynthetic reads found by Identify, the ```metabgc quantify``` command should be executed with the following parameters: \n\n\t```\n    1. --identify_fasta, required=True: Path to the identified-biosynthetic-reads.fasta file produced by MetaBGC-Identify.\n    2. --nucl_seq_directory, required=True: Directory of reads for the metagenomic samples to be analyzed.

Not specified for single or interleaved reads. Example: .R1.fastq\n    6. --R2_file_suffix, required=False: Suffix including extension of the file name specifying the reverse reads. Not specified for single or interleaved reads. Example: .R2.fastq \n\t7. --cohort_name, required=True: Name of the cohort of metagenomic samples used for analysis.\n\t8. --blastn_search_directory, required=False: Directory with BLAST search of the synthetic read files against the TP genes. Computed if not provided. To compute seperately, please see job_scripts in development.\n\t9. --output_directory, required=True: Directory to save results.\n\t10. --cpu, required=False: Number of CPU threads to use (Def.=4). \n\t```\n2. The output of the quantify command is are abundance profile files:\n ```\n    1. unique-biosynthetic-reads-abundance-table.txt : Contains the read level abundance matrix.\n    2. unique-biosynthetic-reads-abundance-table-wide.txt : Contains the sample and read level abundance values.  \n ``` \n\n### Running Cluster to generate biosynthetic read bins\n1. To generate BGC bins of **unique biosynthetic reads**, users should use the abundance profile file, **unique-biosynthetic-reads-abundance-table.txt**, produced by Quantify as input for ```metabgc cluster```. The input parameters to the script are:\n\n\t```\n\t1. --table, required=True: Path of tab-delimited abundance table,unique-biosynthetic-reads-abundance-table.txt, produced by MetaBGC-Quantify.\n\t2. --table_wide, required=True: Path of tab-delimited sample and read level abundance table,unique-biosynthetic-reads-abundance-table-wide.txt, produced by MetaBGC-Quantify.\n\t3. --identify_fasta, required=True: Path to the identified-biosynthetic-reads.fasta file produced by MetaBGC-Identify.\n\t4. --max_dist, required=False: Maximum Pearson distance between two reads to be in the same cluster. (Def.=0.1)\n\t5. --min_samples, required=False: Minimum number of samples required for a cluster. If min_samples > 1, noise are labelled as -1. (Def.=1).\n\t6. --min_reads_bin, required=False: Minimum number of reads required in a bin to be considered in analytics output files. (Def.=10)\n\t7. --min_abund_bin, required=False: Minimum total read abundance required in a bin to be considered in analytics output files. (Def.=10)\n\t8. --cpu, required=False: Number of CPU threads. (Def.=1)\n\t```\n\n2. The cluster command produces the following files:\n```\n    1. unique-biosynthetic-reads-abundance-table_DBSCAN.json: Bin labels assigned DBSCAN, comprised of all the biosynthetic reads clustered in json format.\n    2. BinSummary.txt : Summary of the bins and other statistics. \n    3. ReadLevelAbundance.tsv: Abundance of each biosynthetic read in each assigned bin with >= min_reads_bin reads. \n    4. SampleAbundanceMatrix.tsv : Abundance matrix of each sample against the bin ids for each bin with >= min_reads_bin reads.\n    5. bin_fasta: Directory with FASTA files containing reads belonging each bin.  \n```   \n\n3. For synthetic datasets, we suggest examining bins that contain at least 50 reads, and for real datasets, we suggest examining bins that contain at least 10 reads (these are suggested parameters and may have to be tuned depending on the specific dataset and protein family analyzed). The resulting bins can be utilized in downstream analyses, such as targeted or untargeted assemblies to obtain the complete BGC, bin abundance calculations to determine the distribution of a given BGC in the entire cohort, etc. Please see the original MetaBGC publication for example analyses. \n\n### Running Search to detect biosynthetic read bins\n\n1. For detecting biosynthetic reads from the protein family of interest using the spHMMs constructed in Build step, the ```metabgc search``` command should be executed with the required input files to run Identify, Quantify and Cluster in ine command. To use our pre-built high-performance spHMMs for cyclases/aromatases commonly found in TII-PKS BGCs (OxyN, TcmN, TcmJ, and TcmI types), LanC_like proteins (found in lantibiotic BGCs), and IucA/IucC proteins (found in siderophore BGCs), please find the high performance input folders [here](https://github.com/donia-lab/MetaBGC/tree/master/MetaBGC-V1/MetaBGC-Build_Outputs).\n\n\t```\n\t1. --sphmm_directory, required=True: The high performance spHMM directory generated from MetaBGC-Build.\n\t2. --nucl_seq_directory, required=True: Directory of reads for the metagenomic samples to be analyzed.

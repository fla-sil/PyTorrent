It functions similar to git. You add your notes to it, and it provides you with a list of your notes and their tags. What is different about Nota Bene is that, your tags have to be in your files, you cannot tag them via NB.\n\nNote Structure\n-------------------------\n\nNota Bene depends on your notes having a certain structure. It looks for YAML front matter in your note. If you provide a title and tags in the YAML front matter of your note, NB will store that information along with your note's path. This way you can filter your notes using the tags in them.\n\nThis way, NB can keep track of notes without caring about the markup you use in your notes.\n\nYAML Front Matter\n************************\n\nYAML front matter should look like this:\n\n::\n\n    ---\n    title: My Interesting Title\n    tags: [life, unverse, everything]\n    date: 2014-11-30 18:18:18\n    ---\n\n\nDate can also be in the followin format:\n\n::\n\n    date: 2014-11-30\n\nBut these two are the only acceptable date formats. If you format dates differently, sorting behavior is undefined.\n\nSee http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/ for details.\n\nWhy?\n-------------------------\n\nNota Bene is a simle tool that I wrote for myself in a couple of hours. I don't even know whether I will use it or not, but hey, here it is.\n\nLicense\n------------------------\nCopyright (c) 2014 Eren Inan Canpolat\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

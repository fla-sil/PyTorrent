Each script contains classes and functions for handling each aspect needed for photogrammetric processing:<br><br>\n\n<b>*CamEnv.py*</b><br>\nHandles the associated data with the camera environment.<br>\nThe <b>GCPs</b> class handles the Ground Control Points (GCPs) and their correspondence to the associated DEM and CamImage object.<br>\nThe <b>CamCalib</b> class handles information concerning the camera calibration, i.e. the intrinsic camera matrix and lens distortion coefficients. This class contains functionality for reading in calibration files from .txt and .mat formats.<br>\nThe <b>CamEnv</b> compiles all the information about the camera environment from the GCPs and CamCalib classes, and also contains information about the camera object (pose and location). This is also where georectification functionality is held, with functions for projection and inverse projection. The class is initialised using a .txt file containing file path directories to all the associated data files.<br>\n\n<b>*DEM.py*</b><br>\nHandles the DEM data. This currently supports .mat and .tif file types.<br>\nThe <b>ExplicitRaster</b> class represents a DEM as a numeric raster with explicit XY cell referencing in each grid cell. The class includes functions for densification, calculating viewsheds, and incorporates unbound functions that import a DEM file from .mat and .tif formats.<br>\n\n<b>*FileHandler.py*</b><br>\nThis module contains a set of functions for reading in data from files (such as image data and calibration information) and writing out data.<br>\n\n<b>*Images.py*</b><br>\nHandles the image data, and the image sequence.<br> \nThe <b>CamImage</b> class holds information about a singular image and contains functionality for importing image data from file and passing specific image bands forward for subsequent processing.<br>\nThe <b>ImageSequence</b> class holds information about an image sequence, i.e. a collection of CamImage objects, from which specific images and image pairs can be called.<br>\n\n<b>*Velocity.py*</b><br> \nCalculates velocities and homography. This can either be achieved through the <b>Velocity</b> class for processing velocities and homography through a series of images, or using the functions provided within the script for processing velocities and homography between an image pair.<br>\n\n<b>*Area.py*</b><br>\nAutomated and manual detection of surface areas from imagery (e.g. supraglacial lakes, meltwater plume surface extent). This can either be achieved through the <b>Area</b> class for defining areas of interest through a series of images, or using the functions provided within the script for defining areas of interest in a single image.<br>\n\n<b>*Line.py*</b><br>\nManual detection of line features from imagery (e.g. glacier terminus position). This can either be achieved through the <b>Line</b> class for defining line features through a series of images, or using the functions provided within the script for defining line features in a single image.<br>\n\n<b>*Utilities.py*</b><br>\nThis module contains a set of functions for plotting and interpolating data.<br><br>\n\n<b>For beginners in programming, it is advised to look at the example applications provided and adapt them accordingly for your own use.

PyTrx has the following key dependencies: <br><br>\n\n<b>OpenCV (v3 and above):</b> <a href=\"https://opencv.org/releases.html\">opencv.org</a><br>\n<b>GDAL (v2 and above):</b> <a href=\"http://www.gisinternals.com/archive.php\">gisinternals.com</a><br>\n<b>Pillow (PIL) (v5 and above):</b> <a href=\"http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/\">pythonware.com</a><br><br>\n\nPyTrx can either be downloaded directly from the GitHub repository, or installed using a package manager such as conda or pip. If downloading directly from GitHub, be aware that these dependencies may not necessarily be installed with distributions of Python (e.g. PythonXY, Anaconda), so you may have to install them. These can be specified using the .yml environment file provided in this repository. PyTrx has been tried and tested with the following dependency version configuration: <b>OpenCV=3.4.2</b>, <b>GDAL=2.3.2</b>, and <b>PIL=5.3</b>. PyTrx also needs other packages, which are commonly included with distributions of Python: <b>datetime</b>, <b>glob</b>, <b>imghdr</b>, <b>math</b>, <b>Matplotlib</b>, <b>NumPy</b>, <b>operator</b>, <b>os</b>, <b>pathlib</b>, <b>PyLab</b>, <b>SciPy</b>, <b>struct</b>, and <b>sys</b>. Compatibility with all newer versions of these packages are highly likely.<br>\n\nIf you are installing PyTrx through a package manager, <b>we recommend using <a href=\"https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/\">conda</a>. Be aware that the PyTrx example scripts are not included with this distribution of PyTrx given the size of the example dataset files. PyTrx is also available through pip, although difficulties with the GDAL package on pip meant that GDAL could not be declared explicitly as a PyTrx dependency. Please ensure that GDAL is installed separately if installing PyTrx through pip.

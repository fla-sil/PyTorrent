These accumulated\ntolerances can close operating gaps and thus result in malfunctioning\nmachinery.\n\nIt should be obvious that all the features of all the parts will not be at the\nmaximum of their tolerance range, nor at their minimum.  This program, in\naddition to calculating gaps based on max/min tolerances, will also calculate\nclearances based on the probability of features being at some median size.\nThis probability calculation is used by a majority of the major manufacturers\ntoday (six sigma).\n\nCost\n----\n\nThis program is \"donationware\", meaning your good grace is needed to support\nthis project.  Recommended cost: $25 per seat.  You may pay for this program\nper the link set up on the website `<http://newconceptzdesign.com/>`_.\n(See the license agreement for more information.)\n\n\nHow it works\n------------\n\nThis program works within a Python [2] command prompt window (or more \npreferably, in an ipython command prompt window).  This program works very \nsimilarly to Python's standard \"list\" command, which is a basic, fundamental\nfeature of Python.  Therefore this program is easy to learn.  YOU DO NOT HAVE\nTO KNOW THE PYTHON LANGUAGE TO USE THIS PROGRAM!\n\nThe fundamental element used in this program is an obect called a \"Stackunit\".\nA Stackunit is composed of a dimension, a tolerance, the name assigned to that\ndimension (e.g., END TO SHOULDER), and the part no. to which that dimension\npertains.  A group of Stackunit objects form a \"Stack\" object.  The Stack \nobject not only contains Stackunit objects, but also has wrapped within it\ncomputer code which carries out analysis and summation of the encompassed\nStackunit objects.  Finally, a group of Stack objects can be grouped together\nin what's called a \"Stacks\" object.  If a dimenion or tolerance changes for one\nStackunit, then if that same Stackunit is used in other Stack objects, it will \nbe automatically updated in all the Stack objects.\n\nDuring the course of building stacks, editing is very common.  Editing involves\nupdating dimensions, inserting new dimensions, rearranging dimensions, etc.\nThis program is designed to facilitate that editing.\n\nTutorial\n--------\n\nIf you have never done a stackup (i.e., by hand), no problem.  A tutorial has\nbeen created to show you how to do this, along with showing you how to use this\nprogram.  It can be found at `<http://newconceptzdesign.com/>`_.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n.. rubric:: Footnotes\n\n..

To run the test\nsuite you can use docker via :code:`docker-compose run --rm dvent-test`\n\nWhy make \"Dvent\"?\n-----------------\nI was leading a team at Discogs_ building a new \"greenfield\" project which needed a basic\nset of event-sourcing models which were immutable, unopinionated about implementation\ndetails, and enabled basic functional patterns.  I couldn't find anything that quite\nfit the need, so I made one over an intense weekend and we've been using it without\nany major modifications for over 15 months as of release :code:`0.1.0` (May 2018).\n\nIt's very plausible that without Discogs_ I would never have written Dvent and even so not\nconsidered it as vialble enterprise-level software.  I consider it the birthplace and indirect\nsponsor of the project.\n\nWhy the name \"Dvent\"?\n---------------------\nAn *extreme* portmanteau of:\n\n- **Domain Driven Design**\n- Discogs_\n- **Event**\n\nObilgatory `naming things`_ is hard reference ;)\n\nSpecial Thanks\n--------------\n- Discogs_ and my team members (you know who you are)!\n- The excellent pyrsistent_ library which makes working with data structures in\n  Python almost as joyful as in Clojure\n- `Greg Young`_ for his many helpful talks, posts, etc. which inform much of this\n  library's patterns\n- `Rich Hickey`_ and the broader Clojure_ community for the inspiration in\n  building practical, immutable, functional solutions\n\n.. _Domain Driven Design: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design\n.. _CQRS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation#Command_query_responsibility_segregation\n.. _Event sourcing: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing\n.. _Discogs: https://www.discogs.com\n.. _pyrsistent: https://github.com/tobgu/pyrsistent\n.. _eventsourcing: https://github.com/johnbywater/eventsourcing\n.. _naming things: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html\n.. _Greg Young: https://twitter.com/gregyoung\n.. _Rich Hickey: https://twitter.com/richhickey\n.. _Clojure: https://clojure.org\n.. _Jupyter: https://jupyter.org/index.html\n.. _behave: https://github.com/behave/behave", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/jcrosen/dvent", "keywords": "eventsourcing event sourcing ddd domain driven design immutable functional", "license": "Apache License 2.0", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "dvent", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dvent/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dvent/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/jcrosen/dvent"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dvent/0.1.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.4", "summary": "Simple, immutable, functional models for domain driven design with event sourcing", "version": "0.1.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p><strong>Dvent</strong> is a minimal set of simple, immutable, and functional models and tools\nintended to support <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design\" rel=\"nofollow\">Domain Driven Design</a> (DDD) and function as the\nsource-of-truth data model in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation#Command_query_responsibility_segregation\" rel=\"nofollow\">CQRS</a> / <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Event sourcing</a> architecture pattern.</p>\n<div id=\"installation\">\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>pip install dvent\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div id=\"dvent-is\">\n<h2>Dvent is</h2>\n<dl>\n<dt>A library</dt>\n<dd>A set of tools from which to build rich solutions, not a solution which you\nmay easily apply to an existing problem.

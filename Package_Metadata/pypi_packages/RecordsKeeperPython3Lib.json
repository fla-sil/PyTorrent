You just have to pass parameters to invoke the pre-defined functions.\n\n- [Stream]((https://github.com/RecordsKeeper/recordskeeper-python-sdk/blob/python-3.0/RecordsKeeperPython3Lib/stream.py) Library to work with RecordsKeeper streams. You can publish, retrieve and verify stream data by using stream class. You just have to pass parameters to invoke the pre-defined functions.\n\n- [Transaction]((https://github.com/RecordsKeeper/recordskeeper-python-sdk/blob/python-3.0/RecordsKeeperPython3Lib/transaction.py) Library to work with RecordsKeeper transactions. You can send transaction, create raw transaction, sign raw transaction, send raw transaction, send signed transaction, retrieve transaction information and calculate transaction's fees by using transaction class. You just have to pass parameters to invoke the pre-defined functions.\n\n- [Wallet]((https://github.com/RecordsKeeper/recordskeeper-python-sdk/blob/python-3.0/RecordsKeeperPython3Lib/wallet.py) Library to work with RecordsKeeper wallet functionalities. You can create wallet, dump wallet into a file, backup wallet into a file, import wallet from a file, lock wallet, unlock wallet, change wallet's password, retrieve private key, retrieve wallet's information, sign and verify message by using wallet class. You just have to pass parameters to invoke the pre-defined functions.\n\n## Unit Tests\n\nUnder RecordsKeeperPython3Lib/test using test data from config.yaml file. \n\n- To run all the test cases:\n\n```bash\npython -m unittest discover -v\n```\n\n- To run a particular test case:\n\n```bash\npython -m unittest testname\n```\n\n- To run test cases with **green**:\n\n```bash\ngreen testname\n```\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe complete docs are here: [RecordsKeeper python library documentation](https://github.com/RecordsKeeper/recordskeeper-python-sdk/tree/python-3.0/docs/source).\n\n- [Read for python version 3 or greater](https://github.com/RecordsKeeper/recordskeeper-python-sdk/tree/python-3.0/docs/source)\n- [Read for python version 2](https://github.com/RecordsKeeper/recordskeeper-python-sdk/tree/master/docs/source)\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2016-2018 Recordskeeper \nLicense: GNU General Public License version 3, see COPYING\n\nPortions copyright (c) 2014-2017 Coin Sciences Ltd\nPortions copyright (c) 2009-2016 The Bitcoin Core developers\nPortions copyright many others - see individual files\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/RecordsKeeper/recordskeeper-python-sdk/tree/python-3.0", "keywords": "recordskeeper,python3,library", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "RecordsKeeperPython3Lib", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/RecordsKeeperPython3Lib/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/RecordsKeeperPython3Lib/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/RecordsKeeper/recordskeeper-python-sdk/tree/python-3.0"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/RecordsKeeperPython3Lib/0.1.1/", "requires_dist": ["requests", "green", "pyyaml"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "RecordsKeeper Python library v3", "version": "0.1.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            RecordsKeeper-python-lib3 <br>=========================<br><br><br>It is an infrastructure to build RecordsKeeper blockchain-based applications, products and is used to work around applications that are built on top of this blockchain platform.<br><br>**Note:** If you're looking for the RecordsKeeper Python Library please see: [RecordsKeeper Python Library](https://github.com/RecordsKeeper/recordskeeper-python-sdk/tree/python-3.0)<br><br><br>## Getting Started<br><br>Before you begin you'll need to have python v3 installed.

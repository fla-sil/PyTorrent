Default views for archetypes content is\r\nincluded, and you can easily create custom views for your content, by simply\r\ncalling it ``blog_item_view``.\r\n\r\nIt supports Plone 4. Plone 3 is not officially supported, but should still work.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of collective.blog.view was sponsored by the \r\n**Bergen Public Library** - http://www.nettbiblioteket.no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing collective.blog.view\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nAll you need to use it is to add it to the dependencies of your Plone setup\r\nin one way or another, and include the zcml.\r\n\r\nAfter this the blog view can be seen by simply adding ``/blog_view`` to the end\r\nof a folder or collection.\r\n\r\nAlthough collective.blog.view doesn't need any installation, there is a\r\nprofile included. If you install this view you get `Blog View` as a view\r\noption for all folders anc collections, easily turning any folder into a Blog\r\nwith a simple click of the button. It will also create the ``blog_view_items``\r\nand ``blog_types`` property, see below.\r\n\r\nInstalling this profile will override any changes you have done to the view\r\nmethods of `Folder`, `Large Plone Folder` and `Collections`. It's generally\r\nnot recommended to install the profile on a heavily customized site, it's\r\nbetter to make the changes manually, they are few and simple.\r\n\r\n\r\nSettings\r\n--------\r\n\r\ncollective.blog.view has only two settings. They are both in \r\n``portal_properties.site_properties``.\r\n\r\n* **blog_view_items**: This integer property will be used as the number of\r\n  items to show per page in the blog view. If it does not exist, it will \r\n  default to ten items.\r\n\r\n* **blog_types**: This lines property will be used to contain the portal_types\r\n  that are considered entries in the blog. If it does not exist, it will \r\n  default to `Document`, `News Item` and `File`.\r\n  It's ignored when you use the blog view on a collection, all items in the\r\n  collection will then be considered blog items.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrettyfication\r\n--------------\r\n\r\ncollective.blog.view is functional out of the box. But it is not *pretty*.\r\nAttempts of making it pretty with a standard Plone site is likely to be\r\nwasted, as most Plone sites tend to have their own content types and their\r\nown skins. So I'm not going to add extra complexity and potential for confusion\r\nin this case, since it's likely to not be used anyway.\r\n\r\nTo make the blog view look great on your site, you will most likely want to\r\ncreate custom entry views for your content types. Simply create a view (Zope 3-\r\nstyle) for your content type and call it blog_item_view. There you return the\r\nHTML you want, without HTML and BODY tags, just the HTML snipped you need.\r\n\r\nThe default views includes the \"Send This / Print This\" links, and if you are\r\nlogged in also the History of th object. This is because the default view \r\nwill use the default ATContentTypes views and their \"main\" macro. For \r\nArchetypes Content that are not standard ATContentType, the base_view will\r\nbe used. If you are using standard content types, you might want to make\r\ncustom views for these too. The procedure is the same.\r\n\r\nLastly, to make it prettier, adjust your css for the blog-listing, blog-item and\r\ncomment-link DIVs, so it looks good on your site.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat this product do not have\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nThere is no Plone Control Panel in this product, nor will there ever be one,\r\nso you need to change the settings through the ZMI. There will also never be\r\nany per-folder settings, as that would require extending the schema for \r\nfolders or have a dedicated blog type, both which will defeat the main goal\r\nof this product: simplicity and flexibility.\r\n\r\nA Plone Control Panel may make sense, but will in that case end up in a\r\nseparate product, and installed separately.\r\n\r\nThis product will never use doctests to test anything besides documentation.\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n=========\r\n\r\n1.5.2 (2013-10-19)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n- Restored italian translation [keul]\r\n\r\n- added zcml include for plone.app.contentmenu [agitator]\r\n\r\n- HTML improvements [jladage]\r\n\r\nThis version has been tested with Plone 4.1.6, 4.2.6 and 4.3.2.\r\n\r\n1.5.1 (2013-05-27)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n- Changed the \"Blog View\" to \"Blog view\", and made sure it worked on collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.5 (2013-05-27)\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- Updated Spanish translation [macagua]\r\n\r\n- Added improvements about i18n [macagua]\r\n\r\n- Added support for locales and translation for blog_view template [cekk]\r\n\r\n- default_item view now uses effective view of the object, and not a base view\r\n  based on portal_type [cekk]\r\n\r\n- Added back the base views based on portal_type as backup, as they work.\r\n  [regebro]\r\n\r\n- If the found view macro fails, there is now a fall back to just showing a \r\n  \"View More..\" link. [regebro]\r\n\r\n- Use standard main_template definitions to get more standard templates \r\n  macros to work. [regebro]\r\n  \r\n- Added the title to the blog view, and also a message if there are no posts\r\n  in the blog view. [keul, mauritsvanrees, regebro]\r\n  \r\nThis version has been tested with Plone 4.0.10, 4.1.6, 4.2.5, 4.3.\r\nPlone 3 may still work, but is untested and unsupported.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4 (2012-01-06)\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- Added a condition on the description that made it possible to use portal root\r\n  as a blog folder. Fix by T. Kim Nguyen. \r\n  [regebro]\r\n\r\nThis version has been tested with Plone 4.0.10, 4.1.3, 4.1.4, 4.2b1 and 4.2b2.\r\nPlone 3 is no longer supported, but should still work.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3 (2010-10-27)\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- The view_methods attribute is no longer clobbered on install.\r\n  [regebro]\r\n\r\n- Fixed XML nesting so blog_type property gets added properly to \r\n  site_properties.\r\n  [jbaldivieso]\r\n\r\n- Fatsyndication should not be a dependency of c.b.view, but c.b.feeds.\r\n  [regebro]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2 (2010-06-30)\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- import Batch directly from PloneBatch since with Zope 2.13 Batch is not\r\n  available at the package level when collective.blog.view is loaded.\r\n  [vangheem]\r\n  \r\n- Forced reverse sorting in the view.\r\n  [regebro]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1 (2010-06-05)\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- collective.blog.feeds needed a setting for portal_types, so for consistency\r\n  collective.blog.view now uses the same setting with the same default. \r\n  [regebro]\r\n\r\n- It now shows the amount of comments each entry has, if it has comments\r\n  enabled. [regebro]\r\n  \r\n- The view now accepts year and month parameters (in the url or form) and\r\n  then restricts the entries to these dates. This means the view now also\r\n  can work as an archive view. [regebro]\r\n  \r\n- Added credits to Bergen Offentlige Bibliotek. [regebro]\r\n\r\n- Plone 4 support.

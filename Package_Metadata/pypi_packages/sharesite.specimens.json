Where issue\nidentifiers appear, you can find more about them by visiting this project's\nissue tracker at TBD.\n\n1.0.9 \u2014 Fix Specimen Types and Hospital Names\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThanks to Heather Kincaid we've got a better way to figure out what the specimen\ncollection type really is for the New Cedars-Sinai specimens, so this release\nfixes that.  In addition, Heather noticed that we already have specimens (via\nUNC) for \"Mass Gen\", so the specimens we added as \"MGH\" should be \"Mass Gen\".\n\n\n1.0.8 \u2014 MOAR BOWEL DISEASE!\n---------------------------\n\nThis release adds some Cedars-Sinai specimens, but *not* the ones that were\nremoved in 1.0.7; these are different Cedars-Sinai specimens, allegedly.  It\nalso adds MGH specimens.\n\n\n1.0.7 \u2014 Un-Cedars-Sinai\n-----------------------\n\nThis release removes the specimens from Cedars-Sinai.  Apparently they were\nalready included from the UNC specimens loaded back in 1.0.0.\n\n\n1.0.6 \u2014 Cedars-Sinai\n--------------------\n\nThis release adds the specimens dumped out of Cedars-Sinai.\n\n\n1.0.5 \u2014 Participants, Not Protocols\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis release changes the labels of \"protocol ID\" to \"participant ID\".  It also\nreally removes commas from years.\n\n\n1.0.4 \u2014\u00a0I Was Born in 1,969\n---------------------------\n\nThis release removes the comma from years in specimen collection pages.\n\n\n1.0.3 \u2014 Spelling Errors\n-----------------------\n\nThis release fixes the spelling of Crohn's Disease.  (It previously appeared\nas \"Chron's Disease\".)\n\n\n1.0.2 \u2014 More Columns\n--------------------\n\nThis releases add the specimen collection type (blood) and ethnicity to the\nfaceted selectors as well as the results table.\n\n\n1.0.1 \u2014 Protocol ID\n-------------------\n\nThis release adds the protocol ID as a column heading on specimens faceted\nlisting.\n\n\n1.0.0 \u2014 Released\n----------------\n\nInitial, released release.\n\n\n0.0.0 \u2014 Unreleased\n------------------\n\nInitial, unreleased release.\n\n\nCopyright\n=========\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 by the California Institute of Technology.

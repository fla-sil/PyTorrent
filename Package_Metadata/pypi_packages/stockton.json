You just know you'll look so adult with\n``joecool@super-cool-domain.com`` on your business cards.\n\nThere's just one flaw in your master plan, it took you so long to get\n``joecool@gmail.com`` setup with the filters the way you like them, and\nyou have 2-factor setup, it would be a shame to start all over fresh,\nthis is where Stockton comes in.\n\nStockton is an email proxy server, its goal is to easily allow you to\nforward one email address, say ``joecool@super-cool-domain.com`` to\nanother email account, say your beloved ``joecool@gmail.com``,\ntransparently, and with as little hassle as possible.\n\nSo how do I use it?\n-------------------\n\nI run it on Ubuntu 14.04, so that's all that's been tested.\n\nThen you need to install it, use pip:\n\n::\n\n    $ sudo pip install stockton\n\nThen, after installation, just run:\n\n::\n\n    $ sudo stockton install super-cool-domain.com \\\n    > --proxy-email=joecool@gmail.com \\\n    > --mailserver=mail.super-cool-domain.com \\\n    > --smtp_password=\"...\"\n\nThat will setup Stockton and report what dns changes you will need to\nmake to ``super-cool-domain.com`` in order to get everything working\ncorrectly. Stockton will automatically setup modern email things like\n`DKIM <http://www.dkim.org/>`__, `SPF <http://www.openspf.org/>`__, and\n`SRS <http://www.openspf.org/SRS>`__ so your emails won't get lost in\nspam folders everwhere.\n\nDomain files\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nStockton can, most likely, host as many domains as you want to throw at\nit, and you can configure those domains using configuration files, so\nlet's say you had a file like this:\n\n::\n\n    # config file for super-cool-domain.org\n\n    # let's send some email to joe, some to his super wonderful wife, and some to both of them\n    joecool@super-cool-domain.org                     joecool@gmail.com\n    janecool@super-cool-domain.org                    janecool@gmail.com\n    family@super-cool-domain.org                      joecool@gmail.com,janecool@gmail.com\n\n    # all stray emails should go to Joe\n    @super-cool-domain.org                            joecool@gmail.com\n\nNow you can add your new ``super-cool-domain.org`` to your mailserver\nusing:\n\n::\n\n    $ stockton add-domain super-cool-domain.org --proxy-file=/path/to/domain.config\n\nAnd Stockton will add that domain to your mailserver and let you know\nwhat dns changes you need to make to make your new domain work.\n\nIf you ever need to update your emails list, just update your file and\nrun:\n\n::\n\n    $ stockton update-domain-proxy --proxy-file=/path/to/domain.config\n\nFAQ\n---\n\nWhy did you write this?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGood question, I'm glad you asked, turns out I've been a little liberal\nwith the email addresses during the 13+ years I've owned my own domain,\nI gave some addresses to my parents, some more to my siblings, even my\nlovely wife got in on the action, and to top it all off, I've probably\ngiven out 300-400 unique email addresses in my various travels around\nthe internets (just because!).\n\nSo when the time came to finally, (finally!) update my aging mailserver,\nI had trouble finding a hosted solution that worked for my particular\nuse case (400+ unique email addresses, going to a few dozen unique email\naddresses) and Stockton was born.\n\nStockton is designed for my specific use case, multiple domains, all\nforwarding to different email addresses, if you have this use case, feel\nfree to give it a spin, if not, then I'd use Gmail.\n\nWhy the name Stockton?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI'm a fan of 1990's Utah Jazz references, here are some animated gifs to\nillustrate Stockton assisting the Mailman...\n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/Jaymon/stockton/blob/master/images/stockton-to-malone-3.gif\n   :alt: \n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/Jaymon/stockton/blob/master/images/stockton-to-malone-2.gif\n   :alt: \n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/Jaymon/stockton/blob/master/images/stockton-to-malone-1.gif\n   :alt: \n\n\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/jaymon/stockton", "keywords": null, "license": "GPLv2+", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "stockton", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/stockton/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/stockton/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://github.com/jaymon/stockton"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/stockton/0.0.7/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Easy peasy email forwarding for a custom domain", "version": "0.0.7", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>You know, Stockton, because it assists the Mailman.</p>\n<div id=\"let-me-paint-you-a-word-picture\">\n<h2>Let me paint you a word picture</h2>\n<p>You have an existing email address that you use for everything, say\n<tt>joecool@gmail.com</tt>, and you like this email address, you really do.\nBut your mom told you it\u2019s time to grow up and so you purchased a super\nfancy schmancy domain, <tt><span class=\"pre\">super-cool-domain.com</span></tt> with the intent to up\nyour email address game.

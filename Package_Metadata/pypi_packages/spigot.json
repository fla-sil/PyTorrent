This way you can syndicate content to a\npump.io account without worrying about flooding the account when\nupdates to the feed are frequent.\n\nFirst you add RSS or Atom feeds, specifying which account to post to,\nthe maximum post frequency, and the format of the posted\nmessage. Spigot will verify and authorize the account once, after\nwhich it can be reused for additional feeds. Each time spigot runs, it\nchecks the feeds for new posts, and determines whether or not a new\nitem should be posted based on the specified interval. Spigot can be\nrun in a cron job (or manually) to make regular posts.\n\nSpigot is inspired by Tricklepost and Brdcst.it. \n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nspigot depends on Python 2.6 or higher and the following non-standard libraries\n\n- pypump = 0.6 https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyPump\n- Universal Feed Parser >= 5.0 http://www.feedparser.org/\n- argparse >= 1.0 (required for Python 2.6) \n\nGit Repo\n========\n\nSpigot's code is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/nathans/spigot\n\n  \nInstallation\n============\n\nYou can install spigot via pip:\n\n    $ sudo pip install spigot\n\nOr you can clone the git repo and install manually:\n\n    $ sudo python setup.py install\n\nIf you are using a virtualenv, you can omit the sudo.\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\nTo configure spigot for first use, run it from the command-line:\n    $ spigot.py\n\nYou will be prompted to configure one feed and its account.\n\nTo add a new feed:\n    $ spigot.py --add-feed\n\n\nRunning\n=======\n\nAfter initial configuration, running spigot will poll your feeds and\npost to the configured accounts if the intervals allow. Running\nwithout specifying any options will result in no console output unless\nthere are warnings or errors.  This is optimal for running spigot as a\ncron job. To view more verbose logging, you can specify\nthe --log-level option.\n\n\nCron\n====\n\nSpigot can be run as a cron job to make sure that the flow of posts is\nregular.  Here is an example crontab entry to run every at the 10th\nminute of each hour:\n\n    10 * * * * cd ~/spigot; spigot.py\n\nRemember, spigot looks for its database and configuration file in the\ncurrent working directory.\n\n\nFAQ\n===\n\nHow can I upgrade an existing install of spigot?\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are two basic steps. First upgrade the code version, then upate\nyour configuration file and database to be compatible with the latest\nversion of spigot.\n\nIf you installed via pip, simply run:\n\n    $ pip install spigot --upgrade\n\nIf you installed manually, be sure to update PyPump to version 0.6.\n\nThe source code includes a script in the utils folder called\nconvert.py. Run that in the same folder as your configuration file and\ndatabase, and the script will modify your database and configuration\nfile to work with the newest release of spigot.\n\nAfter obtaining the source:\n\n    $ python utils/convert.py\n\nThe upgrade script creates a backup of both files in case anything\ngoes wrong.\n\nWhere does Spigot store its configuration files and database?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpigot stores its configuration (spigot.json) and database (spigot.db)\nin the working directory from which it is invoked. If you are running\nSpigot from a cron job, you'll want to first cd into the directory\ncontaining these.\n\nStarting with version 2.3.0, spigot delegates the storage of\ncredentials to PyPump. These are stored by default in\n~/.config/PyPump/credentials.json\n\nHow often should I run Spigot?\n------------------------------\n\nThere are a couple factors which weigh on this. First, you want to run\nit often enough so that catches all of the posts in the feeds it is\npolling. For example, if you are polling a feed which lists 10 items\nand is updated about 5 times per hour, you need to run Spigot at least\nevery 2 hours to catch all of those posts in its database.\n\nSecond, you'll want to run Spigot more often than the shortest\ninterval in your configuration. If you run spigot less often than the\nshortest interval, posts will effectively happen only as often as\nSpigot runs.\n\nIn brief, Spigot should run more often than you want to actually post.\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\n(c) 2011-2015 Nathan D.

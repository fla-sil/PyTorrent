It was first designed to simulate\nthe outbreak of COVID-19 in small populations in enclosed environments, such as a FPSO (floating production storage and\noffloading vessel) but has since been expanded to simulate much larger populations with dynamic parameters.\n\nThis README file contains all essential information but you can also visit our [documentation](https://covid19-outbreak-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) for more details.\n\n## Background\n\nThis simulator simulates the scenario in which\n\n-   A group of individuals in a population in which everyone is susceptible.\n-   The population can be divided into multiple subgroups with different parameters.\n-   One or more virus carriers are introduced to the population, potentially after a fixed\n    days of self-quarantine.\n-   Infectees are by default removed from from the population (or separated, or\n    quarantined, as long as he or she can no longer infect others) after they\n    displayed symptoms, but options are provided to act otherwise.\n\nThe simulator simulates the epidemic of the population with the introduction of\ninfectors. Detailed statistics are captured from the simulations to answer questions\nsuch as:\n\n1. What is the expected day and distribution for the first person to show\n   symptoms?\n2. How many people are expected to be removed once an outbreak starts?\n3. How effective will self-quarantine before dispatch personnels to an\n   enclosed environment?\n\nThe simulator uses the latest knowledge about the spread of COVID-19 and is\nvalidated against public data. This project will be contantly updated with our\ndeepening knowledge on this virus.\n\n## Modeling the outbreak of COVID-19\n\nWe developed multiple statistical models to model the incubation time, serial interval,\ngeneration time, proportion of asymptomatic transmissions, using results from\nmultiple publications. We validated the models with empirical data to ensure they\ngenerate, for example, correct distributions of serial intervals and proporitons\nof asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic cases.\n\nThe statistical models and related references are available at\n\n-   [Statistical models of COVID-19 outbreaks (Version 1)](https://bioworkflows.com/ictr/COVID19-outbreak-simulator-model/1)\n-   [Statistical models of COVID-19 outbreaks (Version 2)](https://bioworkflows.com/ictr/COVID19-outbreak-simulator-model/2)\n\nThe models will continuously be updated as we learn more about the virus.\n\n## How to use the simulator\n\nThis simulator is programmed using Python >= 3.6 with `numpy` and `scipy`.\nA conda environment is recommended. After the set up of the environment,\nplease run\n\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nto install required packages, and then\n\n```\npip install covid19-outbreak-simulator\n```\n\nto install the package.\n\nYou can then use command\n\n```\noutbreak_simulator -h\n```\n\nto check the usage information.\n\n## Command line options\n\n```\n$ outbreak_simulator -h\nusage: outbreak_simuator [-h] [--popsize POPSIZE [POPSIZE ...]]\n                       [--susceptibility SUSCEPTIBILITY [SUSCEPTIBILITY ...]]\n                       [--symptomatic-r0 SYMPTOMATIC_R0 [SYMPTOMATIC_R0 ...]]\n                       [--asymptomatic-r0 ASYMPTOMATIC_R0 [ASYMPTOMATIC_R0 ...]]\n                       [--incubation-period INCUBATION_PERIOD [INCUBATION_PERIOD ...]]\n                       [--repeats REPEATS] [--keep-symptomatic]\n                       [--pre-quarantine [PRE_QUARANTINE [PRE_QUARANTINE ...]]]\n                       [--infectors [INFECTORS [INFECTORS ...]]]\n                       [--interval INTERVAL] [--logfile LOGFILE]\n                       [--prop-asym-carriers [PROP_ASYM_CARRIERS [PROP_ASYM_CARRIERS ...]]]\n                       [--allow-lead-time] [--analyze-existing-logfile]\n                       [-j JOBS]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --popsize POPSIZE [POPSIZE ...]\n                        Size of the population, including the infector that\n                        will be introduced at the beginning of the simulation.\n                        It should be specified as a single number, or a serial\n                        of name=size values for different groups.

The simulation will be aborted if the\n                        infector shows symptom before introduction. If you\n                        quarantine multiple people or specified named groups,\n                        you will need to append the IDs to the parameter (e.g.\n                        --pre-quarantine day nurse1 nurse2\n  --infectors [INFECTORS [INFECTORS ...]]\n                        Infectees to introduce to the population, default to\n                        '0'.

Here\n`0` and `1` are IDs of individuals\n\n### Changing model parameters\n\n```\noutbreak_simulator --prop-asym-carriers 0.10\n```\n\nruns the simulation with a fixed ratio of asymptomatic carriers.\n\n```\noutbreak_simulator --incubation-period normal 4 2\n```\n\nruns the simulation incubation period sampled from a normal distribution with\nmean 4 and standard deviation of 2.\n\n### Specigy group-specific parameters\n\nParameters `symptomatic-r0`, `asymptomatic-r0` and `incubation-period` can be\nset to different values for each groups. These are achived by \"multipliers\",\nwhich multiplies specified values to values drawn from the default distribution.\n\nFor example, if in a hospital environment nurses, once affected, tends to have\nhigher `R0` because he or she contact more patients, and on the other hand\npatients are less mobile and should have lower `R0`. In some cases the nurses\nare even less protected and are more susceptible. You can run a simulation\nwith two patients carrying the virus with the following options:\n\n```\noutbreak_simulator --popsize nurse=10 patient=100 \\\n    --symptomatic-r0 nurse=1.5 patient=0.8 \\\n    --asymptomatic-r0 nurse=1.5 patient=0.8 \\\n    --susceptibility nurse=1.2 patient=0.8 \\\n    --infector patient0 patient1\n```\n\n## Output from the simulator\n\nThe output file contains events that happens during the simulations.\nFor example, for command\n\n```\noutbreak_simulator --repeat 100 --popsize 64 --logfile result_remove_symptomatic.txt\n```\n\nYou will get an output file `result_remove_symptomatic.txt` with the following columns:\n\n| column   | content                                                                                                                |\n| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `id`     | id of the simulation.                                                                                                  |\n| `time`   | time of the event in days, accurate to hour.                                                                           |\n| `event`  | type of event                                                                                                          |\n| `target` | subject of the event, for example the ID of the individual that has been quarantined.                                  |\n| `params` | Additional parameters, mostly for the `INFECTION` event where simulated $R_0$ and incubation period will be displayed. |\n\nCurrently the following events are tracked\n\n| Name                | Event                                                                                   |\n| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `INFECTION`         | Infect an non-quarantined individual, who might already been infected.                  |\n| `INFECION_FAILED`   | No one left to infect                                                                   |\n| `INFECTION_AVOIDED` | An infection happended during quarantine.

We however\nmade a small number of tools available. Please feel free to submit or own script for inclusion in the `contrib`\nlibrary.\n\n### `time_vs_size.R`\n\nThe [`contrib/time_vs_size.R`](https://github.com/ictr/covid19-outbreak-simulator/blob/master/contrib/time_vs_size.R) script provides an example on how to process the data and produce\na figure. It can be used as follows:\n\n```\nRscript time_vs_size.R  simulation.log 'COVID19 Outbreak Simulation with Default Paramters' time_vs_size.png\n```\n\nand produces a figure\n\n![time_vs_size.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ictr/covid19-outbreak-simulator/master/contrib/time_vs_size.png)\n\n### `merge_summary.py`\n\n[`contrib/merge_summary.py`](https://github.com/ictr/covid19-outbreak-simulator/blob/master/contrib/merge_summary.py) is a script to merge summary stats from multiple simulation runs.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis tool has been developed and maintained by Dr. Bo Peng, associate professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, with guidance from Dr. Christopher Amos, from the [Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/research/office-of-research/clinical-and-translational-research).

Detailed statistics are captured from the simulations to answer questions\nsuch as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the expected day and distribution for the first person to show\nsymptoms?</li>\n<li>How many people are expected to be removed once an outbreak starts?</li>\n<li>How effective will self-quarantine before dispatch personnels to an\nenclosed environment?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The simulator uses the latest knowledge about the spread of COVID-19 and is\nvalidated against public data. This project will be contantly updated with our\ndeepening knowledge on this virus.</p>\n<h2>Modeling the outbreak of COVID-19</h2>\n<p>We developed multiple statistical models to model the incubation time, serial interval,\ngeneration time, proportion of asymptomatic transmissions, using results from\nmultiple publications. We validated the models with empirical data to ensure they\ngenerate, for example, correct distributions of serial intervals and proporitons\nof asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic cases.</p>\n<p>The statistical models and related references are available at</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bioworkflows.com/ictr/COVID19-outbreak-simulator-model/1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Statistical models of COVID-19 outbreaks (Version 1)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bioworkflows.com/ictr/COVID19-outbreak-simulator-model/2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Statistical models of COVID-19 outbreaks (Version 2)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The models will continuously be updated as we learn more about the virus.</p>\n<h2>How to use the simulator</h2>\n<p>This simulator is programmed using Python &gt;= 3.6 with <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code>.\nA conda environment is recommended.

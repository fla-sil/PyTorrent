It allows\nwriting game \u201ecartridges\u201c for the server, which it can then run. Players\naccess the game while being outside with a mobile device.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nThe server component, the framework and the games are developed in pure\nPython. There are a few design/development principles:\n\n-  Game cartridges must be easy to develop with basic Python skills\n-  The framework and engine must be dynamic enough to allow a large\n   number of different game types to be developed\n-  The framework must not carry any code that is specific to only a\n   single type of game\n-  Development is test-driven and test-first\n-  pylint is to be used and obeyed\n-  Code must at all times be compatible with Python versions in Debian\n   stable and Debian unstable\n\nFeatures of the web frontend\n----------------------------\n\nThe web frontend was originally intended to provide a quick view into\nthe game state on a Veripeditus server. It has, however, developed to\nbecome a full-featured client for playing.\n\nDepending on how cool HTML5 turns out to be, it might become the\nofficial client and thus the first real-world HTML5 location based\nreal-time game.\n\nBrowser compatibility\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Veripeditus web frontend is developed and tested exactly on Mozilla\nFirefox as there are no other free browsers that support HTML5 in a\nreasonable way and can be entrusted with privacy critical data like\ngeolocation of a user.\n\nMozilla Firefox is available in any serious Linux distribution, as well\nas for Android from the free `F-Droid <https://f-droid.org>`__ app\nstore. Rumour has it that there is also a version for iOS.\n\nTesting system\n--------------\n\nA testing system is available at http://nightly.veripeditus.org/ .

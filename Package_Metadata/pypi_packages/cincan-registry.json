See more in [upstream checking.](#upstream-checker)\n\n[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/CinCan/cincan-registry/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/CinCan/cincan-registry/commits/master)\n\n## Installation\n\nTool can be installed by running following command:\n\n`pip install git+https://gitlab.com/cincan/cincan-registry`\n\nTo be able to list locally available tools, \"Docker\" must be running on your machine.\n\nTool is not currently in pip, but should be in future.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Regular listing\n\nThe main purpose is to list available local or remote CinCan tools and their sizes and versions.\n\nWe are also able to list upstream versions of tools, for those where this feature is configured. This is handled more thoroughly in [Upstream Checker section.](#upstream-checker)\n\n\nTo list both available local and remote tools with tag \"latest-stable\", simply write\n```\ncincanregistry list\n\n```\n\nWhen running first time, output could look something like this:\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/CinCan/cincan-registry/-/raw/master/img/list_tools.svg\">\n\n\n\nBy default, \"latest-stable\" tag is always used, unless overridden with `--tag` or `-t` argument.\n\n\nTo list only locally available tools with tag \"latest-stable\", argument `--local` (or `-l`) can be used. Additionally, when listing only tools for specific location, listing will show all viable tags pointing into same image.\n\n```\ncincanregistry list --local\n```\nExample output should look something like this:\n\n![Example local tool list](https://gitlab.com/CinCan/cincan-registry/-/raw/master/img/local_tool_list.png)\n\n\nTo do same for remote, use `--remote` (or `-r`) argument. By adding flag `-a`, this shows tools with all possible tags.\n```\ncincanregistry list --remote -a \n```\n\nAll commands are supporting JSON output. Simply add `--json` or `-j` argument. To combine previously mentioned `-t` flag, we can use following arguments to provide JSON output:\n\n```\ncincanregistry list -ljt latest\n```\nThis lists locally available tools with 'latest' tag in JSON format.\n\nJSON will contain also size of the images. \n\nFor `local` images, size is as *uncompressed* and for remote images, as *compressed* size. \n\nBy adding size column for regular listing, `--size` (or `-s`) argument can be used.\n\nTo list local images with all tags and size column included:\n\n```\ncincanregistry list -lsa\n```\n\n### Version listing and comparison\n\nTo see more about versions, we need to use `versions` subcommand. By running\n\n```\ncincanregistry list versions\n```\n\ntool will fetch version information from configured upstreams. By default it lists only locally available tools, and compares their versions into remote versions, and further remote versions into upstream versions. \n\n**With help of this, we should be always acknowledged whether our tool is *really* up-to-date or not!**\n\nCurrent implementation lists those tools as red `#AA0000`, where is immediate update available on remote. (local version differs from remote)\n\nIf local and remote are equal, but possible upstream of the tool has update, those are listed as grey `#808080`. \n\n![Version listing example](https://gitlab.com/CinCan/cincan-registry/-/raw/master/img/version_list.png)\n\nAs seen in the above image, green should indicate, that at least for that line, everything there is *fine*.\n\nArgument `--name` (or `-n`) can be used to check updates for single tool, and exclusive argument `--only-updates` or `-u` can be used to show only tools where there are updates available.\n\nIt should be noted, that tool is not able to directly tell, if there is actually newer version available. It only detects deviations. \n\nThey ways how versions are marked in global level, are varying too much. However tool is very good at detecting same versions, even if they are marked bit differently.\n\nMost of the preceding arguments with `list` subcommand will change the behavior of `versions` subcommand as well.\n\nFor example command:\n```\ncincanregistry list -rj versions --only-updates\n```\n\nWill produce JSON output from remote tools; generating their versions and filtering only for onces with available version updates, after checking configured upstreams for those available.\n\n\n### All available options\n\n| Specific to `list`      |    | Description |\n|-------------------------|----|-------------|\n| --config                | -c | Path to configuration file |\n| --tag                   | -t | Filter images by tag name. |\n| --all                   | -a | Show images with all tags. (Excludes --tag or -t) |\n| --size                  | -s | Include  size column when listing |\n| --json                  | -j | Produce output in JSON format\n| --local                 | -l | List only locally available 'cincan' tools. Excludes --remote or -r\n| --remote                | -r | List remotely available 'cincan' tools. Excludes --local or -l\n\nSize will be here always included in JSON regardless is it used with argument or not.\n\n| Specific to `list versions` |    | Description\n|-------------------------|----|-------------|\n| --name                  | -n | Check single tool by the name.\n| --only-updates          | -u | Lists only available updates. Excludes --name or -n\n| --with-tags             | -w | Include tag column when listing single tool; shows usable tags for that version.\n| --force-refresh         | -f | Refresh all version related cache data including meta files.\n\nThese can be used with the combination of `list` options `-l` and `-r` to produce varying outputs. Arguments `-t`, `-a` and `-s` are ineffective when used with `versions` subcommand.\n\nTool is attempting to always find the latest available version among all tags.\n\n## Upstream checker\n\nCinCan Registry has feature to check available new versions for tool, if this feature is just configured for selected tool and there is implementation for provider.\n\nCurrently supported providers are:\n\n* `GitHub` - versions by release, tag-release or commit\n* `GitLab` - versions by release or tag-release\n* `BitBucket` - versions by release or tag-release\n* `Debian packages` - latest package version for any suite\n* `Alpine packages` - latest package version for any Alpine version\n* `PyPi` - latest release for any package\n* `Tools by Didier Stevens` - latest release for any published tool in his GitHub repository with similar versioning\n\nMultiple origins can be configured for every tool, however two should be enough, and in most cases just one. One for source of the tool (e.g. GitHub) and second origin for installation method in Dockerfile (e.g. tool installed as Alpine package into Dockerfile). Only one is needed and is ideal; hopefully tool is installed from direct source in Dockerfile.\n\n### Configuring tool to be checked for origin version updates\n\nCurrently configuration files, so called 'metafiles' are stored into same place as Dockerfiles: [CinCan's tool repository.](https://gitlab.com/CinCan/tools) Every file is named as `meta.json`.\n\nHere is [example configuration](https://gitlab.com/CinCan/tools/-/blob/master/binwalk/meta.json) of binwalk. It has two providers where another is *source code* origin, and another is just *upstream for Dockefile*.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"upstreams\": [\n    {\n      \"uri\": \"https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk\",\n      \"repository\": \"ReFirmLabs\",\n      \"tool\": \"binwalk\",\n      \"provider\": \"GitHub\",\n      \"method\": \"release\",\n      \"origin\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"uri\": \"https://sources.debian.org/api/src/binwalk/\",\n      \"tool\": \"binwalk\",\n      \"provider\": \"Debian\",\n      \"method\": \"release\",\n      \"suite\": \"buster\",\n      \"docker_origin\": true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nRequired attributes depends on provider, but usually at least repository, tool, provider and method are required. URI might be enough some cases.\n\n(TODO add provider  specific documentation)\n\nCurrently tool is looking these files directly from tools' GitLab repository and caching them after first download, so debugging and development might be hard sometimes. **Cache is refreshed every 24 hours.**\n\nBy default, these files are stored into folder `$HOME/.cincan/version_cache` \n\nHowever, there is option make tool to use different local path, and disable remote downloading to help development. Path could be for example place, where you clone `tools` repository.\n\nSee [configuration for more details.](#Additional-configuration)\n\n\n### Adding new provider\n\nAdding new provider is straighforward - [inherit UpstreamChecker](cincanregistry/checkers/_checker.py) class and add implementation in the same folder. Existing implementations can be used as model. \n\nShort idea is, that there is meta file for every tool, containing upstream information in JSON format, and based on this information, correct provider implementation is selected, and tool information is forwarded for it, and finally version information is fetched from correct place with this way.\n\nNew provider class should implement at least one method `_get_version()` which returns latest version of tool from the provider, based on configuration.\n\nAs result. this *checker* just returns latest available version in configured format. (Latest release number, latest tag, latest commit? Or something else.)\n\nAdditionally, in [__init__](cincanregistry/checkers/__init__.py) file, provider name must be mapped for correct classname.\n\nJSON file is given as dictionary parameter into constructor of UpstreamChecker, so all values should be accessible in child-class.\n\nOnce this is implemented, everything else should work automatically. Either tool with configuration for new provider is requred for testing, or simply add tests for it in [tests](tests) folder.\n\n##  Additional configuration\n\nBy default, configuration file is stored in $HOME/.cincan/registry.json\n\nDifferent file can be used with `--config` or `-c` option.\n\nConfiguration file does not have many options, but some are needed.\n\nData from DockerHub registry is cached into some specific path with `tools_cache_path` attribute.\n\n`tokens` attribute can contain multiple tokens with schema \\<provider\\>:token.\nTokens are helpful in cases, when API limit is needed to be increased for version checking. Caching is used to reduce the amount of requests.\n\n`versions` attribute contains some version checking specific details: `cache_path` is location, where metafiles and version cache is stored.\n\n`metadata_filename` is filename to be checked as metafile.\n\n`disable_remote` when set as `True`, disables downloading of metafiles from GitLab, which are required for upstream checking, if files do not exist yet. Disabling might be helpful when some tool is in development phase and version checking is just to be added.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tools_cache_path\": \"/home/<username>/.cincan/tools.json\",\n  \"tokens\": {\n    \"github\": \"<TOKEN>\"\n  },\n  \"versions\": {\n    \"cache_path\": \"/home/<username>/.cincan/version_cache\",\n    \"metadata_filename\": \"meta.json\",\n    \"disable_remote\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## More in depth\n\nThis tool takes advantage of Docker Hub's Registry API, when listing remote tools and their sizes and versions. Version information is extracted from `manifest` file, which is containing the configuration of Docker Image. More precisely, version information value is acquired for `TOOL_VERSION` environment variable in the configuration.\n\nThis same variable is used for acquiring the version information on local as well, however we are using configuration information provided by `Docker Engine`.\n\nDocker Images should have been build by using this variable, so the information is correct.\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://gitlab.com/cincan/cincan-registry", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "cincan-registry", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/cincan-registry/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/cincan-registry/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://gitlab.com/cincan/cincan-registry"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/cincan-registry/0.1.0rc3/", "requires_dist": ["docker (>=4.1)"], "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "CinCan Registry: a tool for listing available CinCan tools, their versions and possible updates.", "version": "0.1.0rc3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>CinCan Registry</h1>\n<p>CinCan registry is  a tool for listing available CinCan tools, their versions, sizes and possible updates up into their original source!</p>\n<p>Available tools can be found in the CinCan's <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/CinCan/tools\" rel=\"nofollow\">tool repository.</a> Source code for tools' Dockerfiles is available in there.</p>\n<p>Currently, no other tools are supported for version information listing or for other details.</p>\n<p>Docker images of remote tools are stored in Docker Hub, <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/u/cincan\" rel=\"nofollow\">under CinCan's profile.</a></p>\n<p>When checking versions beyond remote (Docker Hub), tool is using multiple different APIs such as GitHub's or GitLab's to acquire most recent availabe versions straight from the source.

Either tool with configuration for new provider is requred for testing, or simply add tests for it in <a href=\"tests\" rel=\"nofollow\">tests</a> folder.</p>\n<h2>Additional configuration</h2>\n<p>By default, configuration file is stored in $HOME/.cincan/registry.json</p>\n<p>Different file can be used with <code>--config</code> or <code>-c</code> option.</p>\n<p>Configuration file does not have many options, but some are needed.</p>\n<p>Data from DockerHub registry is cached into some specific path with <code>tools_cache_path</code> attribute.</p>\n<p><code>tokens</code> attribute can contain multiple tokens with schema &lt;provider&gt;:token.\nTokens are helpful in cases, when API limit is needed to be increased for version checking. Caching is used to reduce the amount of requests.</p>\n<p><code>versions</code> attribute contains some version checking specific details: <code>cache_path</code> is location, where metafiles and version cache is stored.</p>\n<p><code>metadata_filename</code> is filename to be checked as metafile.</p>\n<p><code>disable_remote</code> when set as <code>True</code>, disables downloading of metafiles from GitLab, which are required for upstream checking, if files do not exist yet. Disabling might be helpful when some tool is in development phase and version checking is just to be added.</p>\n<pre><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">\"tools_cache_path\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"/home/&lt;username&gt;/.cincan/tools.json\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">\"tokens\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"github\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"&lt;TOKEN&gt;\"</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">},</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">\"versions\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"cache_path\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"/home/&lt;username&gt;/.cincan/version_cache\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"metadata_filename\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"meta.json\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"disable_remote\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">false</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</pre>\n<h2>More in depth</h2>\n<p>This tool takes advantage of Docker Hub's Registry API, when listing remote tools and their sizes and versions. Version information is extracted from <code>manifest</code> file, which is containing the configuration of Docker Image. More precisely, version information value is acquired for <code>TOOL_VERSION</code> environment variable in the configuration.</p>\n<p>This same variable is used for acquiring the version information on local as well, however we are using configuration information provided by <code>Docker Engine</code>.</p>\n<p>Docker Images should have been build by using this variable, so the information is correct.</p>\n\n          </div>"}, "last_serial": 7162325, "releases": {"0.1.0rc1": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "37330809af6a8cf0a8c02b88f313ce72", "sha256":

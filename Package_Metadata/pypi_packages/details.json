You can find out more about these reports and how to enable them\nfor your AWS accounts [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/detailed-billing-reports.html).  All testing thus far has been\ndone using the **Detailed billing report with resources and tags** but the\ncode should work with any detailed billing report.\n\nOnce you have enabled detailed billing on your accounts, AWS will begin to\nsave these CSV reports in the S3 bucket you have configured.  The ``details``\nlibrary assumes you have copied the reports from S3 to your local file\nsystem and uncompressed them if necessary.  The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli) is a good way to copy the files from S3.\n\nThe detailed billing files contain a row (a line item) for every charge on an\naccount with hourly granularity.  These files can get **huge**.  These tools\ncurrently load an entire months worth of data into memory so if you have a\nreally large bill this could become impractical.  However, it has been\ndemonstrated to work reasonably well on detailed billing reports containing\nmillions of line item records.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nOnce you have a detailed billing CSV file available locally, you can load\nthe file into ``details`` like this:\n\n    >>> import details\n    >>> total = details.load('../../bills/123456789012-aws-billing-detailed...')\n\nThe variable ``costs`` now points to a ``Cost`` object which contains all of\nthe line item data for the entire billing file.  Note that depending on the\nsize of your detailed billing report, this operation can take some time.\n\nNow that you have the ``Cost`` object, you can start by asking it for \nthe total cost of the detailed billing report:\n\n    >>> total.cost\n    Decimal('1035.7549984289')\n    >>>\n\nThis number should match (or very nearly match, there are some rounding\nerrors at times) the total on your bill.  The other thing to note is that\nthe value returned is a Python Decimal number.  The Decimal type is used\nto avoid any further rounding errors within the ``details`` package.\nYou can use these Decimal numbers as you would normal ints or floats.\nCheckout [this](https://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html)\nfor more details on the Decimal type.\n\nIn addition to telling you the total cost, the ``Cost`` object has\na few other useful methods.\n\nTo find all of the *columns* in CSV data:\n\n    >>> total.columns\n    ['InvoiceID',\n     'PayerAccountId',\n     'LinkedAccountId',\n     'RecordType',\n     'RecordId',\n     'ProductName',\n     'RateId',\n     'SubscriptionId',\n     'PricingPlanId',\n     'UsageType',\n     'Operation',\n     'AvailabilityZone',\n     'ReservedInstance',\n     'ItemDescription',\n     'UsageStartDate',\n     'UsageEndDate',\n     'UsageQuantity',\n     'BlendedRate',\n     'BlendedCost',\n     'UnBlendedRate',\n     'UnBlendedCost',\n     'ResourceId',\n     'user:Name',\n     'user:Role']\n\nTo find all possible values found within a particular column:\n\n    >>> total.values('ProductName')\n    ['Amazon Simple Storage Service',\n     'Amazon DynamoDB',\n     'Amazon Route 53',\n     'Route 53 Domain Registration Service',\n     'AWS Data Pipeline',\n     'Amazon Elastic MapReduce',\n     'Amazon RDS Service',\n     'Amazon Zocalo',\n     'Amazon Simple Queue Service',\n     'AWS Support (Business)',\n     'Amazon Simple Notification Service',\n     'Amazon CloudFront',\n     'AWS Support (Developer)',\n     'Amazon WorkSpaces',\n     'Amazon Redshift',\n     'Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud',\n     'Amazon ElastiCache',\n     'Amazon Kinesis',\n     'Amazon CloudSearch',\n     'Amazon SimpleDB',\n     'Amazon Simple Email Service']\n\nThis list will include only the services that actually were used within\nthis account.\n\nIf this report was for a consolidated account, you could find all of the\naccounts contained within this report like this:\n\n    >>> total.values('LinkedAccountId')\n    ['012345678901',\n     '123456789012']\n    >>>\n\nThe above total represents all of the costs for all services within this\naccount.  What if you wanted to find the costs just for the EC2 service?\nTo do this, use the ``filter`` method.  It takes a list of filters where\neach filter consists of a column name and a regular expression.  Each value in\nthat column name is compared to the regular expression and if it matches\nit is collected and returned with all of the other matches in another\n``Costs`` object.\n\n    >>> ec2 = total.filter([('ProductName', '.*Compute Cloud.*')])\n    >>> ec2.cost\n    Decimal('315.88505363')\n    >>>\n\nSo the total cost for EC2 in this account was $315.89.  However, if you\ncompare that to your bill you will probably find that it doesn't match.\nThe reason (probably) is that this number includes all Data Transfer\ncharges incurred as part of the EC2 usage but your monthly bill breaks\ndata transfer out as a separate line item.  To break out the data transfer\ncosts:\n\n    >>> data_transfer = ec2.filter([('UsageType', '.*DataTransfer.*')])\n    >>> data_transfer.cost\n    Decimal('35.45916220')\n    >>>\n\nSo, if you subtract the data transfer costs from the EC2 costs you should\nsee the number on your bill.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/scopely-devops/details", "keywords": null, "license": "Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

Each value in\nthat column name is compared to the regular expression and if it matches\nit is collected and returned with all of the other matches in another\n<tt>Costs</tt> object.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; ec2 = total.filter([('ProductName', '.*Compute Cloud.*')])\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ec2.cost\nDecimal('315.88505363')\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the total cost for EC2 in this account was $315.89.  However, if you\ncompare that to your bill you will probably find that it doesn\u2019t match.\nThe reason (probably) is that this number includes all Data Transfer\ncharges incurred as part of the EC2 usage but your monthly bill breaks\ndata transfer out as a separate line item.  To break out the data transfer\ncosts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; data_transfer = ec2.filter([('UsageType', '.*DataTransfer.*')])\n&gt;&gt;&gt; data_transfer.cost\nDecimal('35.45916220')\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, if you subtract the data transfer costs from the EC2 costs you should\nsee the number on your bill.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n          </div>"}, "last_serial": 1269525, "releases": {"0.1.0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "eff182115c3f8c5ec15f89ce1fffb3c7", "sha256": "958c11b3143c69ceb2d170a9c0a293e0889c39c4a60e24870ff48dc8f0d198db"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "details-0.1.0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "eff182115c3f8c5ec15f89ce1fffb3c7", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 8793, "upload_time": "2014-10-13T22:00:40", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2014-10-13T22:00:40.069330Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d4/6a/b8c9b3f3c1c34f51ccc26e672bcbca36522d0c9da4195cece228987600a0/details-0.1.0.tar.gz", "yanked": false}], "0.2.0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "03832bf2ca3b15ab577ef653029e69fc", "sha256": "c767226f01c65a752e5bf750200f6101fff7b25a128d686b6af58f694d7a7aa4"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "details-0.2.0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "03832bf2ca3b15ab577ef653029e69fc", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 11810, "upload_time": "2014-10-14T03:34:27", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2014-10-14T03:34:27.412095Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/6c/38/7d3efb9e661add4f31f938807ee24746f0948c5aa25a59a29a81d2b75bbf/details-0.2.0.tar.gz", "yanked": false}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "03832bf2ca3b15ab577ef653029e69fc", "sha256": "c767226f01c65a752e5bf750200f6101fff7b25a128d686b6af58f694d7a7aa4"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "details-0.2.0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "03832bf2ca3b15ab577ef653029e69fc", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 11810, "upload_time": "2014-10-14T03:34:27", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2014-10-14T03:34:27.412095Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/6c/38/7d3efb9e661add4f31f938807ee24746f0948c5aa25a59a29a81d2b75bbf/details-0.2.0.tar.gz", "yanked": false}], "timestamp": "Fri May  8 00:38:56 2020"}

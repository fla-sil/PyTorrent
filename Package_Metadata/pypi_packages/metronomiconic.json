An iconic metronome.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n``pip install metronomiconic``\n\nIt requires python3+ to run.\n\nDo you know Victor Wooten?\n--------------------------\n\nIn one of his videos on working with metronome, this incredible musician\nshowed an exercise to build one's rhythm feel: you play a groove/a\nphrase to a comfortable click tempo, say 120 bpm. Then, when you feel\nyou're in the pocket, you drop the tempo 2 times, but play the same. You\njust end up with less clicks to hear. When you're confident you've\ncaught the pulse, you drop it once again. In the end, you're playing the\nsame fast groove in 120 bpm, supported by only 1 click per 2 or even 4\nbars. Isn't that an incredible exercise?\n\nBut here's the problem: when practicing, you need to stop and adjust\nyour metronome tempo carefully for a few seconds, effectively losing the\npocket and feel. With ``metronomiconic`` it only takes one keypress.\n\nPlease read further.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nInstall it.\n\nCreate a directory under your home directory called ``.metronomiconic``.\nPlace there two or three sound files (``bar.wav``, ``beat.wav``,\n``division.wav`` which can be omitted, and if it is, you will be unable\nto hear subdivision notes).\n\nA collection of default click sounds from popular DAWs can be found\n`here <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1053122/metronome%20samples.zip>`__.\nThe reason I do not include them in distribution in simple: they are not\nfree, and the free ones I've heard... well I don't like them.\n\nYou're ready to go. Type ``metronomic`` in your favorite terminal\nemulator.\n\nPress space bar to stop or start. Use arrow keys and arrow keys with\nshift to change tempo. Use digits, alt+up and alt+down to change time\nsignature (1 to 9 for beat count and 1,2,4,8,16 for beat length are\nsupported). Tempo is measured with quarter notes.\n\nPress p to stop/start play subdivisions. Press t, q or s to switch\ntriplet, quintuplet or septuplet subdivision mode starting with the next\nbar (normally, every beat is subdivisioned in sixteenth notes).\n\nAnd now for the most cool part: doubling and halfing the tempo.\n\nPress u or d to double or half the tempo from the next bar.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nI'm a learning bass player, and I couldn't get why I can't find a\nmetronome that would do this half/double thing for me, so I had to come\nup with my own. The 'learning functions', as I call them, that include\nhalf/double and tri-, quintu- and septuplet modes work from the next bar\nplayed. All the other changes take place immediately.\n\nI've tested metronome's accuracy for a little while, but so far I can\nsay it's pretty accurate, compared with a few hardware, DAW and online\nmetronomes.\n\nDo not look in the code! It's very messy and unmaintainable, and there\nis at least one very dirty hack.\n\nReleased under MIT license.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/trueneu/metronomiconic/archive/v0.0.2.zip", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/trueneu/metronomiconic", "keywords": null, "license": "MIT", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "metronomiconic", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/metronomiconic/", "platform": "Posix; MacOS X", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/metronomiconic/", "project_urls": {"Download": "https://github.com/trueneu/metronomiconic/archive/v0.0.2.zip", "Homepage": "http://github.com/trueneu/metronomiconic"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/metronomiconic/0.0.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "The music learner's metronome with double/half tempo feature", "version": "0.0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>Metronome which does all you\u2019d expect from a metronome, and has a unique\ndouble/half tempo feature!

The agent exposes information that your router can't expose by itself like the BGP table, traffic per BGP prefix or traffic per ASN. This data is then provided both via a WebUI and an API.\n\nThe agent is vendor agnostic as it gathers data using both BGP and netflow/sflow/ipfix. This means it can be attached to any router or switch that supports those protocols.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\nThe agent will expose a Web UI and an API that will allow you do things like:\n\n* Retrieve Top ASN's based in bandwidth usage.\n* Retrieve Top prefixes based in bandwidth usage.\n* Simulate what would happen if you had top N prefixes only in your FIB instead of the full routing table.\n* Store and retrieve arbitrary data.\n* Get raw BGP from your router.\n* Get raw flow data from your router.\n* Look for all the prefixes that traverses or originates in a particular ASN.\n* Check all the prefixes in the router that allows you to reach certain prefixes or IP.\n\nYou can read the full list of features in the following [link](http://sdn-internet-router-sir.readthedocs.org/en/latest/features/index.html).\n\nApplications\n============\n\nThis agent will give you some visibility about your network.

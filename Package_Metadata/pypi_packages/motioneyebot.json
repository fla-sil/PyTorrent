View the license attribution\nin \"motioneyebot/data/csv_file_license.html\".\n\n\nRequires:\n---------\n- An internet connection.\n- Python 3.5 or higher.\n\nSetup:\n------\n\n**********************************************************\n1) Create a GroupMe bot and add it to your selected group.\n**********************************************************\n\nYou can create bots by registering an account on\nhttps://dev.groupme.com/. This is also where you may find your\naccess token, bot ID, and group ID which you will be prompted\nfor the first time you launch the program. It is recommended\nthat you paste these items in a text editor buffer for later use.\n\n\n******************************************************************\n2) Install a web server on the machine that will run this program.\n******************************************************************\n\nBelow demonstrates how to install Apache in Linux, though any\nweb server will suffice.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    sudo apt install -y apache2\n\n\n*********************************************************************\n3) Ensure ownership of directory containing your server's index file.\n*********************************************************************\n\nBelow demonstrates giving user ownersip to Apache's html directroy\nin Linux. This is the location where the program will download an\nimage from the motion camera and post to GroupMe on a user's request.\nKeep note of this path as you will be asked to enter it the first time\nyou run the program.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    sudo chown -R [username]:[username] /var/www/html\n\n\n*********************************************************************\n4) Ensure a static IP address and forward TCP port 80 to the address.\n*********************************************************************\n\nYou must ensure that the device which will run this program and\nhost your server has a static IP address. This process will vary\ndepending on the device you are using and the type of network/router\nbeing used.\n\nYou must then forward the HTTP/TCP port 80 to the device's\nstatic IP address. Port forwarding settings are available in most\nrouters' administrator settings. If you are already forwarding port\n80 to another device, try using a port such as port 8000 or 8080.\n\nYou will also need to find your public ip address. This will be used\nto allow GroupMe API to locate your HTTP server to download images\nfrom. If you used a port besides 80, record your public IP address\nin the form [IP]:[port] (i.e. 12.345.67.89:8000). This will be what\nyou enter in the 6th step of setup upon executing the program for\nthe first time.\n\n\n*******************************************************\n5) Configure the MotionEye camera's settings if needed.\n*******************************************************\n\nLocate the IP address of your MotionEyeOS camera. If you haven't\nalready, open the MotionEye system's settings and assign the camera's\nIP address as static. You will be asked to enter this IP address in\nthe first time you run the program so you may want to record it as well.\n\nOPTIONAL: If you have specified a Dropbox or Google Drive folder for\nyour MotionEye camera to upload content to, you may enter the URL in\nthe 'UPLOADS_URL' field. Otherwise, you may leave this section blank.\n\n\n****************\n6) Installation\n****************\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip3 install motioneyebot\n\n\n*************\n7) Execution\n*************\n\nThe program should now be able to execute successfully. Note that\nif your device has a power management feature that disconnects a\nnetwork interface (commonly WiFi), you will need to disable it to\nallow the program to run continuously without having to reconnect\nto the internet. The first time you execute the program, you will\nwalk through a setup process that looks like this:\n\n::\n\n    motioneyebot\n\n    ################ motioneyebot Configuration ################\n\n    Thank you for using motioneyebot!

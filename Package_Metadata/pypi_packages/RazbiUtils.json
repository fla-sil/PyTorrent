Which wasn't a problem for chrome, but it was on many other random programs.\n\n\nThe second issue was both the click speed and the **screenshot** speed. The click speed was fixed once again by **pynput** and for the screenshot I used something written using win32api by **Frannecklp** [Here's a link to the origin of the screenshot <https://pythonprogramming.net/next-steps-python-plays-gta-v/>]\n\n\nThe third issue I attempt to solve is to make it work for multiple monitors and to make the coordinate system easier, by letting you specify portions of the screen without specific coordinates. I've fixed this by detecting the monitors using win32api and organising it.\n\n# Examples\n\n### Basic template detection\n```python\nfrom RazbiUtils import ScreenScraper\n\nsc = ScreenScraper()\n\npath_to_template = 'object_to_detect'\nif sc.find_on_screen_bool(path_to_template):\n    print(\"Object Detected\")\n```\n\nAssuming that you have a path to an actual **.png** that it's on the main screen right now. The script should be able to detect it.\n[For managing template images, I strongly recommend paint.net <https://www.dotpdn.com/downloads/pdn.html> as it's free, easy to use and lighweight]\n\nOk, but let's make a little more interesting: let's make it click on the found object:\n\n```python\nfrom RazbiUtils import ScreenScraper, InputController\n\nsc = ScreenScraper()\n\npath_to_template = 'object_to_detect'\nfound = sc.find_on_screen(path_to_template)\nif found:\n    print(f\"Object Detected at {found[0]}\")\n    InputController.click(sc.center(found[0]))\n```\n```Object Detected at Box(left=1590, top=951, width=189, height=54)```\n\nNote that I use `found[0]` instead of just `found`, because the screenshot by default returns a list of all found objects, [0] being the first.\nAlso note that you if you don't use sc.center(), you'll use only the top-left of the detected image.\n\n### Multi-monitor support:\nLet's say you want to screenshot something visible on your second monitor, pyautogui is normally unable to do this, but with RazbiUtils you just do:\n```python\nfrom RazbiUtils import ScreenScraper, ScreenManager\n\nsc = ScreenScraper()\n\npath_to_template = 'object_to_detect'\nif sc.find_on_screen_bool(path_to_template, ScreenManager.screens[1]):\n    print(\"Object Detected\")\n```\nThe order of the screens are basically, the order you set in the OS.\n\nAlso if you want to screenshot just specific parts to make the screenshot fast without actual coordinates you can do:\n`ScreenManager.screens[0].bottom_right` for just the bottom right. Also you can do `ScreenManager.main_screen` which is equivalent with `ScreenManager.screens[0]`\n\nNote: You can also instantiate ScreenManager if you want to reference it in a shorter form like `sm`\n\n\n### Mouse clicks support on ANY app\n\nI'm referring to just clicks, mouse movements won't work certainly. \nKeep in mind that internally it uses `pynput` for clicks, so if you just want that, just use `pynput`.\n\nThe InputController.click() has a parameter for `framerate` by default 60.\nThat means the delay between clicks is 1/60 which is 0.016, which will guarantee it will register the click if the app is 60fps.\n\nFor some reason the pyautogui clicks don't work on most games, so feel free to use this library or `pynput` for clicks\n\n### Support\nIf you have any suggestions, please make a pull request, so far I added only features I use really often for ScreenScraping, but I'm sure I haven't covered everything that's being used by everyone.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/GloryToArstotzka/RazbiUtils", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "RazbiUtils", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/RazbiUtils/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/RazbiUtils/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/GloryToArstotzka/RazbiUtils"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/RazbiUtils/0.0.3/", "requires_dist": ["pyautogui", "pywin32", "opencv-python", "pynput", "win32gui"], "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "This is a wrapper around  win32api, pyautogui and pynput.", "version": "0.0.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>RazbiUtils</h1>\n<p>This package is a wrapper around  win32api, pyautogui and pynput intended for ScreenScraping.</p>\n<p><code>pip install RazbiUtils</code></p>\n<p>RazbiUtils supports at least python 3.6 and I've tested it only on <strong>windows</strong>.

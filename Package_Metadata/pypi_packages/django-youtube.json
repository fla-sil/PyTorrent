If you don't set them, default settings will be used.\n    \n    # url to redirect after upload finishes, default is respected `video` page\n    YOUTUBE_UPLOAD_REDIRECT_URL = '/youtube/videos/'\n\n    # url to redirect after deletion video, default is `upload page`\n    YOUTUBE_DELETE_REDIRECT_URL = '/myurl/'\n\nAdd Following lines to your urls.py file\n\n    (r'^youtube/', include('django_youtube.urls')),\n    \nDon't forget to run `manage.py syncdb`\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nGo to `/youtube/upload/` to upload video files directly to youtube. When you upload a file, the video entry is created on youtube, `Video` model that includes video details (`video_id`, `title`, etc.) created on your db and a signal sent that you can add your logic to it.\nAfter successful upload, it redirects to the specified page at `YOUTUBE_UPLOAD_REDIRECT_URL`, if no page is specified, it redirects to the corresponding video page.\n\nYoutube API is integrated to the `Video` model. In order to change information of the video on Youtube, just save the model instance as you normally do, `django_youtube` will do the necessary changes using Youtube API.\n\nApi methods can be used separately. Please see `api.py` to get info about methods. Please note that some operations requires authentication. Api methods will not do more than one operation, i.e. will not call authenticate method. So you will need to authenticate manually. Otherwise api methods will raise `OperationError`.  Please see `views.py` for a sample implementation.\n\nYou can use views for uploading, displaying, deleting the videos.\n\nYou can also override templates to customise the html. `Iframe API` used for displaying the videos for convenience. Please see Youtube API Docs (https://developers.google.com/youtube/) to implement other player API's on your template files. Other options are `Javascript API` and `Flash API`.\n\nSignals\n-------\n\nThe `video_created` sent after video upload finished and video created successfully. You can also choose to register `post_save` event of `Video` model\nFollowing is an example of how you process the signal\n\n    from django_youtube.models import video_created\n    from django.dispatch import receiver\n    \n    @receiver(video_created)\n    def video_created_callback(sender, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"\n        Youtube Video is created.\n        Not it's time to do something about it\n    \"\"\"\n    pass", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/laplacesdemon/django-youtube", "keywords": null, "license": "BSD licence, see LICENCE.txt", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "django-youtube", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-youtube/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-youtube/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/laplacesdemon/django-youtube"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-youtube/0.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Youtube API wrapper app for Django.

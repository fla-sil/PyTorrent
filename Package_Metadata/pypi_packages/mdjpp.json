Finally, the file can be use as a\nbasis for some kind of report or even as a report itself. If you decide to use\nmarkup, let it be `Markdown <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown>`_, your notes may look quite elegant.\n\nImagine now, that you are *dr. No* and you work in *ACME* company as a member of\n*Y-man support team*. You did some work. Each day you put some notes and\nused some tags. Your work log may look following::\n\n    **ACME**\n\n    Y-man support team\n    dr No\n\n    Work log.\n\n    20181022\n    --------\n\n    *X-substance*\n\n    Testing alternative synthesis:\n\n    * Z + Y -> X\n    * Z + V + U -> X + W\n\n    *garden*\n\n    Singing to the flowers.\n\n    20181023\n    --------\n\n    *X-substance* *IT*\n\n    Simulation of X-substance stability.\n\n    *garden*\n\n    Taking care of bees.\n\n    20181024\n    --------\n\n    *X-substance*\n\n    Purification.\n    \n    **It's alive!**\n\nAlthough, markup languages are nice and allows to produce nice looking documents \nor web pages, they lack of convenient support for tagging. In the above example\n*X-substance* annotation was consequently used to mark actions related to *X-substance* development etc.\n\nObvious question emerges, how to get a report on *X-substance* only?\n\nSolution\n========\n\nThe above log can be annotated according to mdJPP tagging syntax. It cane be later\nsubmitted to mdJPP preprocessor that can produce document extracts according to\ntags and dates.\n\nSyntax\n^^^^^^\n\nmdJPP tags, including dates, starts always with double ``@@`` character.\nIn the current version only one tag can be used in one line so there is no\ninline tags (not yet!). There are two types of tags:\n\n#. Date tags, for example ``@@20181103``.\n#. (Normal) tags, for example ``@@X-substance``.\n\nPlease note, that dates are always written as YYYYMMDD.\n\nNormal tags can be joined. If particular note is related with *X-substance*\ndevelopment and *IT* work, it can be annotated with two tags::\n\n    @@X-substance\n    @@IT\n    \nTags written one after another without blank lines are joined and note that\nfollows is tagged with *X-substance* and *IT*.\n\nStructure\n^^^^^^^^^\n\nmdJPP annotated documents **always** have following structure:\n\n* Plain text (optional)\n* Global normal tags that annotate all that follows (optional)\n    * Plain text (optional)\n    * Date tag (optional)\n        * Plain text (optional)\n        * Normal tag that annotate text note that follows (optional)\n            * Plain text (optional)\n        * Normal tag that annotate text note that follows (optional)\n            * ...\n    * Date tag (optional)\n        * ...\n\nPlease note two facts:\n\n#. All elements of the document's structure are optional.\n#. All mdJPP documents have **always** the same structure.\n\nExample\n^^^^^^^\n\nLet's use mdJPP tagging for *dr. No* notes::\n\n    **ACME**\n\n    @@Y-man support team\n    @@dr No\n\n    Work log.\n\n    @@20181022\n\n    @@X-substance\n\n    Testing alternative synthesis:\n\n    * Z + Y -> X\n    * Z + V + U -> X + W\n\n    @@garden\n\n    Singing to the flowers.\n\n    @@20181023\n\n    @@X-substance\n    @@IT\n\n    Simulation of X-substance stability.\n\n    @@garden\n\n    Taking care of bees.\n\n    @@20181024\n\n    @@X-substance\n\n    Purification.\n\n    **It's alive!**\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nOnce the log is annotated with mdJPP tags, prepocessor can be used to produce nice\nlooking document by redirecting its output to, say, `pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>`_::\n\n    mdjpp dr_no_log.mdj | pandoc > dr_no_log.html\n\nThis is all unless you want to do some filtering.\n\nFilters\n^^^^^^^\n\n**ACME** boss wants you to report progress on *X-substance* development since October 23rd?\n::\n\n    mdjpp dr_no_log.mdj --only-tag X-substance --date-from 20181023\n    \nWant to do more?\n::\n   \n    mdjpp --help\n    \n   \nIndex\n^^^^^\n\nIf several files are submitted to mdJPP and one of them ends with `index.mdj` it\nis processed first.\n\nThis allows to put all global tags and other titles to the index and real work\nlogs can be kept in other files.\n\nExample\n^^^^^^^\n\nSo, how it looks like? It depends on rendering options. Currently, three rendering engines\nare available:\n\n#. *Null* - This render engine does not render at all. Useful when you want to do filtering only. This is default render engine.\n#. *Markdown* - Changes global, date, and normal tags to header level 1, 2, and 3 accordingly. Uses some emphasis for tags strings. To switch it on use ``--md`` option. It is useful when you want to produce PDF or ODT documents.\n#. *HTML* - Renders global and normal tags as *nice* boxes with coloured text. Uses emphasis for date tags and uses some horizontal lines. To switch it on use ``--html`` option.\n\nHere are examples of HTML documents created with `HTML rendering engine <https://tljm.github.io/mdjpp/test_journal.html>`_, and with\n`Markdown rendering engine <https://tljm.github.io/mdjpp/test_journal_md.html>`_.\n\nLook also at this `PDF document created with Markdown rendering engine <https://tljm.github.io/mdjpp/test_journal.pdf>`_.\n\n**Please note** that the above examples are done with `pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>`_ ``--metadata=\"title:Your smart title\"``. The title is, therefore, added at the beginning of documents.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nmdJPP can be installed with following command::\n\n    pip install mdjpp\n    \nQuestion & Answer\n=================\n\n#. *Hey dude, why don't you put all that notes to some database and use SQL to query DB and get what you want?*\n   \n   That's a very good question.

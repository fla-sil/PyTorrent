However, if we order\nthe data by date, then by period and then by draw number we can mitigate any\nill effects this bad data causes. This version attempts to fix the problem by\ndoing just that.\n\n**What has changed from version 0.5 to 0.6?**\n\nOn July 6th, 2015 the `NLCB <http://www.nlcb.co.tt/>`_ started drawing Play Whe\n4 times per day. The script was changed to correctly scrape the 4:00 PM draw.\n\nAlso, previously the \"period\" stored with the results was changed from a\nnumeric format \"(1, 2, 3)\" to a string format \"('EM', 'AM', 'AN', 'PM')\".\n\n**What has changed from version 0.4 to 0.5?**\n\nAround February 21st, 2015 the NLCB took down their website to redesign\nand rebuild it. They changed the service URL along with the format of\nthe HTML results. This required an update to the parser to ensure that\nthe results could still be retrieved in the future.\n\n**What has changed from version 0.3 to 0.4?**\n\nOn November 21st, 2011 the NLCB started drawing Play Whe 3 times per day.\nDue to this change the display format of the results retrieved via their\nwebsite was changed. Since this program simply scrapes the HTML off their\nresults page, I needed to update the script to work with the new format.\n\nHence, the logic for retrieving and storing the Play Whe results have\nchanged. However, the interface to perform these operations have not.\n\n**How do I install it?**\n\n::\n\n    $ tar xvzf playwhe-0.7.1.tar.gz\n    $ cd playwhe-0.7.1\n    $ sudo python setup.py install\n\n**What are some of the things it can do?**\n\nYou can get Play Whe results directly from NLCB using the playwhe module.\n\n::\n\n    import playwhe\n    p = playwhe.PlayWhe()\n\n    # retrieve and display all the results for the month of April in the year 2011\n    print \"\\n\\n\".join(map(lambda r: r.prettyprint(), p.results_for_month(2011, 4)))\n\n    # retrieve and display the results for April 2nd, 2011\n    print \"\\n\\n\".join(map(lambda r: r.prettyprint(), p.results_for_day(2011, 4, 2)))\n\n    # retrieve and display the three most recent results\n    print \"\\n\\n\".join(map(lambda r: r.prettyprint(), p.results()))\n\nYou can get Play Whe results directly from NLCB using the playwhe.py script.\n\n::\n\n    $ echo Retrieve and display the results for the month of April in the year 2011\n    $ playwhe.py --pretty-print --date=2011-04\n    $ playwhe.py -p -d 2011-04\n\n    $ echo Retrieve and display the results for April 2nd, 2011\n    $ playwhe.py --pretty-print --date=2011-04-02\n    $ playwhe.py -p -d 2011-04-02\n\n    $ echo Retrieve and display the three most recent results\n    $ playwhe.py --pretty-print\n    $ playwhe.py -p\n\nYou can keep a local copy of previous Play Whe results in an SQLite database.\n\n::\n\n    $ echo Create and initialize a Play Whe database\n    $ playwhe.py --createdb=\"/home/<username>/playwhe.db\"\n    $ playwhe.py -c \"/home/<username>/playwhe.db\"\n\n    $ echo Update the Play Whe database\n    $ playwhe.py --updatedb=\"/home/<username>/playwhe.db\"\n    $ playwhe.py -u \"/home/<username>/playwhe.db\"\n\n    $ echo Update the Play Whe database and keep a log\n    $ playwhe.py -u \"/home/<username>/playwhe.db\" 2>> \"/home/<username>/playwhe.log\"\n\n**Where can I get the latest development version of this project?**\n\nThis project is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/dwayne/playwhe.\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone git://github.com/dwayne/playwhe.git\n\n**What liscense does this project use?**\n\nThis project is in the public domain.

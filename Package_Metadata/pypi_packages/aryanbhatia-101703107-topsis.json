You can use this simple package to get ranks on basis of topsis approach, ypu simply need to pass NumPy array after pre-processing your data along with weights between 0 and 1 and all weights should sum to 1 to get correct results and you need to pass impacts as well in form of '+' or '-' where '+' indicates that you need to maximise value of that particular column and '-' indicates that you need to minimise value of that particular column.

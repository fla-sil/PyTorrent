ViXeN has been designed primarily to assist\nfield biologists with managing the large amount of media they collect in\na minimally intrusive manner.\n\nOne may think of ViXeN as a special, customizable file browser with which\none may view and edit metadata associated with media files like videos, images,\nand audio.\n\nThe ViXeN documentation is at https://vixen.readthedocs.io\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Works with different types of media, videos, images, audio, text, and PDF.\n- Supports any number of user-defined metadata fields per project.\n- Does not modify the original media but keeps its metadata separately.\n- Powerful searching through metadata.\n- Lightweight and easy to install.  No server setup required.\n- Cross-platform: works on Linux, OS X, and Windows.\n- Simple browser-based UI.\n- Support to export metadata to a CSV file and import tags from a CSV file.\n- Ability to add metadata for media through an external program or a Python\n  script.\n- Support to allow user-defined conversions of media to supported versions.\n- Open source.\n\nViXeN has currently been tested with about 350k files in a single project. It\nwill work fine for larger projects but will be progressively slower the larger\nthe number of files. The speed does not however depend on the nature of the\nmedia. ViXeN does not currently support multiple people working on the same\nproject at the same time.\n\n\nDownload\n---------\n\nIf you are not familiar with Python you can install ViXeN using a very simple\nbinary installer on all the major platforms. To try out ViXeN please download\na binary installer from here:\n\n  https://github.com/vixen-project/vixen/releases\n\nThese are very easy to install, basically just download, unzip, and run.\n\nIf you are familiar with Python packages, you can install ViXeN using the\nstandard Python mechanisms of either running `python setup.py install` or with\n[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) using `pip install vixen`. Once installed, simply\nrun `vixen` to start the application.\n\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nViXeN was envisaged as a 'no-fuss' means to manage videos from 32 camera traps\nthat were set up in the Banni grasslands in north-west India to survey species\noccurrence and interaction patterns, with a focus on carnivores. The research\nproject began in 2013 and as of 2015 has resulted in 6000+ videos. When\nconfronted with the daunting task of viewing and managing such volumes of\nmedia files, we realized that there was a dearth for tools to aid in the\nprocessing of such data. There were data managers for images but nothing suitable\nfor video (and to a certain extent, audio) files.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nIf you have any questions or are having any problems with ViXeN, please email\nor post your questions on the vixen-users mailing list here:\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/forum/vixen\n\nIf you should have specific problems with ViXeN, you may eitiher email us on\nthe list mentioned above or file an issue on github here:\nhttps://github.com/vixen-project/vixen/issues/new\n\nIf you do not mind, you can consider sending along the [vixen log\nfile](https://vixen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#troubleshooting).\n\nWe welcome any contributions to this project. Please submit a pull-request on\ngithub and we will be happy to consider any suggestions and improvements.\n\nOne useful, and perhaps underutilized feature of github is that if you want to\nmake a change to the software or documentation, you may do so directly on\ngithub and submit that as a pull-request for us to consider without having to\nlearn git, forking the project, and manually submitting a pull-request.\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nDesigned and Developed by Prabhu Ramachandran and Kadambari Devarajan\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/vixen-project/vixen", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "vixen", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/vixen/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/vixen/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/vixen-project/vixen"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/vixen/1.0rc3/", "requires_dist": ["traits", "jigna", "tornado (<5.0)", "json-tricks (>=3.0)", "whoosh", "backports.csv"], "requires_python": "<3.7", "summary": "View eXtract and aNnotate media", "version": "1.0rc3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>ViXeN: View eXtract and aNnotate media</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/vixen-project/vixen\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Build Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/952dbbb1143a00e7d4f935521eb5e602598f07c0/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f766978656e2d70726f6a6563742f766978656e2e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://ci.appveyor.com/project/prabhuramachandran/vixen\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Build status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/0e279f4592fdeff65eaff247ccca9cbba4300be2/68747470733a2f2f63692e6170707665796f722e636f6d2f6170692f70726f6a656374732f7374617475732f39736d7379627270783034626d6832323f7376673d74727565\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://codecov.io/gh/vixen-project/vixen\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"codecov\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/7a78bbcc7af8d829e7a9439401f4211759a818e3/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f762e696f2f67682f766978656e2d70726f6a6563742f766978656e2f6272616e63682f6d61737465722f67726170682f62616467652e737667\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://vixen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Documentation Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/033aefe87e80eb5d6ba088c5b33ad0ecd7295e1a/68747470733a2f2f72656164746865646f63732e6f72672f70726f6a656374732f766978656e2f62616467652f3f76657273696f6e3d6c6174657374\"></a></p>\n<p><img alt=\"ViXeN logo\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/12ca16a143bc3853b2e70c764338407d88ba0b86/68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f766978656e2d70726f6a6563742f766978656e2f6d61737465722f646f63732f736f757263652f696d616765732f6c6f676f5f736d616c6c2e706e67\"></p>\n<p>ViXeN is a simple tool to facilitate easily viewing, adding, and annotating\nmetadata associated with media.

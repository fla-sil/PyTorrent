Motwani, Shiyu Huang, Hannah Sim, and Haixing Yin.\n\nChemKinLib (Chemical Kinetics Library) consists of classes and functions to allow the user to interpret the kinetics of a system of chemical reaction by computing the associated reaction rates. The library currently supports:\n\n- Elementary reactions: irreversible and reversible\n\nAnd of these reactions, the following reaction rate coefficients are supported:\n- Constant\n- Arrhenius\n- Modified Arrhenius\n\nThis Python library is designed to exhibit flexibility, extensibility, and ease of use. The initial input provided by the user is an `.xml` file while other individual parameters (temperature and concentrations) are entered during runtime.\n\n## Installation\nThere are two options for installing ChemKinLib:\n\n1) Clone the repository into you local system.\n\n2) Execute in terminal: `python3 setup.py install` or `python3 -m pip install -e .`\n\nOR\n\n1) Execute in terminal: `pip3 install chemkinlib11`\n\n2) Try executing `import chemkinlib` to test the installation in your terminal.\n\n## Examples\nThere are two examples in the `examples` subdirectory: (a) `rev_rxns.py` (system of reversible, elementary reactions) and (b) `irrev_rxns.py` (system of irreversible, elementary reactions). They show the user how to set up a calculation using ChemKinLib to compute the reaction rate of each specie involved in the reactions. In addition, there is an iPython notebook tutorial (`basic-tutorial.ipynb`) that goes through the steps to compute reaction rates for a set of irreversible reactions.\n\n## Documentation\nThe documentation for the library can be found [here](https://github.com/cs207-group11/cs207-FinalProject/blob/master/CS207_Documentation.pdf).\n\n## Dependencies\nSee [requirements](https://github.com/cs207-group11/cs207-FinalProject/blob/master/requirements.txt) for dependencies.\n\n## License\nSee [LICENSE](https://github.com/cs207-group11/cs207-FinalProject/blob/master/LICENSE) file distributed with ChemKinLib for more information.\n\n## Contributing\nContributions are welcome (post project evaluation).

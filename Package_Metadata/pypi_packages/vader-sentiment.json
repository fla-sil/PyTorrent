Ann Arbor, MI, June 2014.** \n\n====================================\nInstallation\n====================================\n\nThere are a couple of ways to install and use VADER sentiment:  \n\n#. The simplest is to use the command line to do an installation from `[PyPI] <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/vaderSentiment>`_ using pip, e.g., \n    ``> pip install vaderSentiment``\n#. Or, you might already have VADER and simply need to upgrade to the latest version, e.g., \n    ``> pip install --upgrade vaderSentiment``\n#. You could also clone this `[GitHub repository] <https://github.com/Holek/vader_sentiment>`_\n#. You could download and unzip the `[full master branch zip file] <https://github.com/Holek/vader_sentiment/archive/master.zip>`_\n\nIn addition to the VADER sentiment analysis Python module, options 3 or 4 will also download all the additional resources and datasets (described below).\n\n====================================\nResources and Dataset Descriptions\n====================================\n\nThe package here includes **PRIMARY RESOURCES** (items 1-3) as well as additional **DATASETS AND TESTING RESOURCES** (items 4-12):\n\n#. vader_icwsm2014_final.pdf\n    The original paper for the data set, see citation information (above).\n\n#. vader_lexicon.txt\n    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with TOKEN, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, STANDARD DEVIATION, and RAW-HUMAN-SENTIMENT-RATINGS\n\tNOTE: The current algorithm makes immediate use of the first two elements (token and mean valence). The final two elements (SD and raw ratings) are provided for rigor.  For example, if you want to follow the same rigorous process that we used for the study, you should find 10 independent humans to evaluate/rate each new token you want to add to the lexicon, make sure the standard deviation doesn't exceed 2.5, and take the average rating for the valence. This will keep the file consistent.\n\n    DESCRIPTION: \n    Empirically validated by multiple independent human judges, VADER incorporates a \"gold-standard\" sentiment lexicon that is especially attuned to microblog-like contexts.\n\n    The VADER sentiment lexicon is sensitive both the **polarity** and the **intensity** of sentiments expressed in social media contexts, and is also generally applicable to sentiment analysis in other domains.\n\n\tSentiment ratings from 10 independent human raters (all pre-screened, trained, and quality checked for optimal inter-rater reliability). Over 9,000 token features were rated on a scale from \"[\u20134] Extremely Negative\" to \"[4] Extremely Positive\", with allowance for \"[0] Neutral (or Neither, N/A)\".  We kept every lexical feature that had a non-zero mean rating, and whose standard deviation was less than 2.5 as determined by the aggregate of those ten independent raters.  This left us with just over 7,500 lexical features with validated valence scores that indicated both the sentiment polarity (positive/negative), and the sentiment intensity on a scale from \u20134 to +4. For example, the word \"okay\" has a positive valence of 0.9, \"good\" is 1.9, and \"great\" is 3.1, whereas \"horrible\" is \u20132.5, the frowning emoticon :( is \u20132.2, and \"sucks\" and it's slang derivative \"sux\" are both \u20131.5.\n\n    Manually creating (much less, validating) a comprehensive sentiment lexicon is a labor intensive and sometimes error prone process, so it is no wonder that many opinion mining researchers and practitioners rely so heavily on existing lexicons as primary resources. We are pleased to offer ours as a new resource. We began by constructing a list inspired by examining existing well-established sentiment word-banks (LIWC, ANEW, and GI). To this, we next incorporate numerous lexical features common to sentiment expression in microblogs, including:\n\n    * a full list of Western-style emoticons, for example, :-) denotes a smiley face and generally indicates positive sentiment\n    * sentiment-related acronyms and initialisms (e.g., LOL and WTF are both examples of sentiment-laden initialisms)\n    * commonly used slang with sentiment value (e.g., nah, meh and giggly). \n\n    We empirically confirmed the general applicability of each feature candidate to sentiment expressions using a wisdom-of-the-crowd (WotC) approach (Surowiecki, 2004) to acquire a valid point estimate for the sentiment valence (polarity & intensity) of each context-free candidate feature. \n\n#. vaderSentiment.py\n    The Python code for the rule-based sentiment analysis engine. Implements the grammatical and syntactical rules described in the paper, incorporating empirically derived quantifications for the impact of each rule on the perceived intensity of sentiment in sentence-level text. Importantly, these heuristics go beyond what would normally be captured in a typical bag-of-words model. They incorporate **word-order sensitive relationships** between terms. For example, degree modifiers (also called intensifiers, booster words, or degree adverbs) impact sentiment intensity by either increasing or decreasing the intensity. Consider these examples:\n\n    (a) \"The service here is extremely good\" \n    (b) \"The service here is good\" \n    (c) \"The service here is marginally good\" \n\n    From Table 3 in the paper, we see that for 95% of the data, using a degree modifier increases the positive sentiment intensity of example (a) by 0.227 to 0.36, with a mean difference of 0.293 on a rating scale from 1 to 4. Likewise, example (c) reduces the perceived sentiment intensity by 0.293, on average.\n\n#. tweets_GroundTruth.txt\n    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, and TWEET-TEXT\n\n    DESCRIPTION: includes \"tweet-like\" text as inspired by 4,000 tweets pulled from Twitter\u2019s public timeline, plus 200 completely contrived tweet-like texts intended to specifically test syntactical and grammatical conventions of conveying differences in sentiment intensity. The \"tweet-like\" texts incorporate a fictitious username (@anonymous) in places where a username might typically appear, along with a fake URL (http://url_removed) in places where a URL might typically appear, as inspired by the original tweets. The ID and MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING correspond to the raw sentiment rating data provided in 'tweets_anonDataRatings.txt' (described below).\n\n#. tweets_anonDataRatings.txt\n    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, STANDARD DEVIATION, and RAW-SENTIMENT-RATINGS\n\n    DESCRIPTION: Sentiment ratings from a minimum of 20 independent human raters (all pre-screened, trained, and quality checked for optimal inter-rater reliability).\n\n#. nytEditorialSnippets_GroundTruth.txt\n    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, and TEXT-SNIPPET\n\n    DESCRIPTION: includes 5,190 sentence-level snippets from 500 New York Times opinion news editorials/articles; we used the NLTK tokenizer to segment the articles into sentence phrases, and added sentiment intensity ratings. The ID and MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING correspond to the raw sentiment rating data provided in 'nytEditorialSnippets_anonDataRatings.txt' (described below).\n\n#. nytEditorialSnippets_anonDataRatings.txt\n    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, STANDARD DEVIATION, and RAW-SENTIMENT-RATINGS\n\n    DESCRIPTION: Sentiment ratings from a minimum of 20 independent human raters (all pre-screened, trained, and quality checked for optimal inter-rater reliability).\n\n#. movieReviewSnippets_GroundTruth.txt \n    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, and TEXT-SNIPPET\n\n    DESCRIPTION: includes 10,605 sentence-level snippets from rotten.tomatoes.com. The snippets were derived from an original set of 2000 movie reviews (1000 positive and 1000 negative) in Pang & Lee (2004); we used the NLTK tokenizer to segment the reviews into sentence phrases, and added sentiment intensity ratings. The ID and MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING correspond to the raw sentiment rating data provided in 'movieReviewSnippets_anonDataRatings.txt' (described below).\n\n#. movieReviewSnippets_anonDataRatings.txt \n    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, STANDARD DEVIATION, and RAW-SENTIMENT-RATINGS\n\n    DESCRIPTION: Sentiment ratings from a minimum of 20 independent human raters (all pre-screened, trained, and quality checked for optimal inter-rater reliability).\n\n#. amazonReviewSnippets_GroundTruth.txt \n    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, and TEXT-SNIPPET \n\n    DESCRIPTION: includes 3,708 sentence-level snippets from 309 customer reviews on 5 different products. The reviews were originally used in Hu & Liu (2004); we added sentiment intensity ratings. The ID and MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING correspond to the raw sentiment rating data provided in 'amazonReviewSnippets_anonDataRatings.txt' (described below).\n\n#. amazonReviewSnippets_anonDataRatings.txt \n    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, STANDARD DEVIATION, and RAW-SENTIMENT-RATINGS\n\n    DESCRIPTION: Sentiment ratings from a minimum of 20 independent human raters (all pre-screened, trained, and quality checked for optimal inter-rater reliability).\n\n\n#.

It also demonstrates how VADER can work in conjunction with NLTK to do sentiment analysis on longer texts...i.e., decomposing paragraphs, articles/reports/publications, or novels into sentence-level analysis.  It also demonstrates a concept for assessing the sentiment of images, video, or other tagged multimedia content.\n\nIf you have access to the Internet, the demo will also show how VADER can work with analyzing sentiment of non-English text sentences.\n\n::\n\n\tfrom vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n\t#note: depending on how you installed (e.g., using source code download versus pip install), you may need to import like this:\n\t#from vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n\n    # --- examples -------\n    sentences = [\"VADER is smart, handsome, and funny.\",  # positive sentence example\n                 \"VADER is smart, handsome, and funny!\",  # punctuation emphasis handled correctly (sentiment intensity adjusted)\n                 \"VADER is very smart, handsome, and funny.\", # booster words handled correctly (sentiment intensity adjusted)\n                 \"VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY.\",  # emphasis for ALLCAPS handled\n                 \"VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY!!!\", # combination of signals - VADER appropriately adjusts intensity\n                 \"VADER is VERY SMART, uber handsome, and FRIGGIN FUNNY!!!\", # booster words & punctuation make this close to ceiling for score\n                 \"VADER is not smart, handsome, nor funny.\",  # negation sentence example\n                 \"The book was good.\",  # positive sentence\n                 \"At least it isn't a horrible book.\",  # negated negative sentence with contraction\n                 \"The book was only kind of good.\", # qualified positive sentence is handled correctly (intensity adjusted)\n                 \"The plot was good, but the characters are uncompelling and the dialog is not great.\", # mixed negation sentence\n                 \"Today SUX!\",  # negative slang with capitalization emphasis\n                 \"Today only kinda sux!

This is the most useful metric if you want a single unidimensional measure of sentiment for a given sentence. Calling it a 'normalized, weighted composite score' is accurate. \n\n  It is also useful for researchers who would like to set standardized thresholds for classifying sentences as either positive, neutral, or negative.  \n  Typical threshold values (used in the literature cited on this page) are:\n\n #. **positive sentiment**: ``compound`` score >=  0.05\n #. **neutral  sentiment**: (``compound`` score > -0.05) and (``compound`` score < 0.05)\n #. **negative sentiment**: ``compound`` score <= -0.05\n\n* The ``pos``, ``neu``, and ``neg`` scores are ratios for proportions of text that fall in each category (so these should all add up to be 1... or close to it with float operation).  These are the most useful metrics if you want multidimensional measures of sentiment for a given sentence.\n\n====================================\nPorts to Other Programming Languages\n====================================\nFeel free to let me know about ports of VADER Sentiment to other programming languages.

The final two elements (SD and raw ratings) are provided for rigor.  For example, if you want to follow the same rigorous process that we used for the study, you should find 10 independent humans to evaluate/rate each new token you want to add to the lexicon, make sure the standard deviation doesn't exceed 2.5, and take the average rating for the valence. This will keep the file consistent.</p>\n<pre><code>DESCRIPTION: \nEmpirically validated by multiple independent human judges, VADER incorporates a \"gold-standard\" sentiment lexicon that is especially attuned to microblog-like contexts.\n\nThe VADER sentiment lexicon is sensitive both the **polarity** and the **intensity** of sentiments expressed in social media contexts, and is also generally applicable to sentiment analysis in other domains.\n\nSentiment ratings from 10 independent human raters (all pre-screened, trained, and quality checked for optimal inter-rater reliability). Over 9,000 token features were rated on a scale from \"[\u20134] Extremely Negative\" to \"[4] Extremely Positive\", with allowance for \"[0] Neutral (or Neither, N/A)\".  We kept every lexical feature that had a non-zero mean rating, and whose standard deviation was less than 2.5 as determined by the aggregate of those ten independent raters.  This left us with just over 7,500 lexical features with validated valence scores that indicated both the sentiment polarity (positive/negative), and the sentiment intensity on a scale from \u20134 to +4. For example, the word \"okay\" has a positive valence of 0.9, \"good\" is 1.9, and \"great\" is 3.1, whereas \"horrible\" is \u20132.5, the frowning emoticon :( is \u20132.2, and \"sucks\" and it's slang derivative \"sux\" are both \u20131.5.\n\nManually creating (much less, validating) a comprehensive sentiment lexicon is a labor intensive and sometimes error prone process, so it is no wonder that many opinion mining researchers and practitioners rely so heavily on existing lexicons as primary resources. We are pleased to offer ours as a new resource. We began by constructing a list inspired by examining existing well-established sentiment word-banks (LIWC, ANEW, and GI). To this, we next incorporate numerous lexical features common to sentiment expression in microblogs, including:\n\n* a full list of Western-style emoticons, for example, :-) denotes a smiley face and generally indicates positive sentiment\n* sentiment-related acronyms and initialisms (e.g., LOL and WTF are both examples of sentiment-laden initialisms)\n* commonly used slang with sentiment value (e.g., nah, meh and giggly). \n\nWe empirically confirmed the general applicability of each feature candidate to sentiment expressions using a wisdom-of-the-crowd (WotC) approach (Surowiecki, 2004) to acquire a valid point estimate for the sentiment valence (polarity &amp; intensity) of each context-free candidate feature. \n</code></pre>\n<p>#. vaderSentiment.py\nThe Python code for the rule-based sentiment analysis engine. Implements the grammatical and syntactical rules described in the paper, incorporating empirically derived quantifications for the impact of each rule on the perceived intensity of sentiment in sentence-level text. Importantly, these heuristics go beyond what would normally be captured in a typical bag-of-words model. They incorporate <strong>word-order sensitive relationships</strong> between terms. For example, degree modifiers (also called intensifiers, booster words, or degree adverbs) impact sentiment intensity by either increasing or decreasing the intensity. Consider these examples:</p>\n<pre><code>(a) \"The service here is extremely good\" \n(b) \"The service here is good\" \n(c) \"The service here is marginally good\" \n\nFrom Table 3 in the paper, we see that for 95% of the data, using a degree modifier increases the positive sentiment intensity of example (a) by 0.227 to 0.36, with a mean difference of 0.293 on a rating scale from 1 to 4. Likewise, example (c) reduces the perceived sentiment intensity by 0.293, on average.\n</code></pre>\n<p>#. tweets_GroundTruth.txt\nFORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, and TWEET-TEXT</p>\n<pre><code>DESCRIPTION: includes \"tweet-like\" text as inspired by 4,000 tweets pulled from Twitter\u2019s public timeline, plus 200 completely contrived tweet-like texts intended to specifically test syntactical and grammatical conventions of conveying differences in sentiment intensity.

This is the most useful metric if you want a single unidimensional measure of sentiment for a given sentence. Calling it a 'normalized, weighted composite score' is accurate.</p>\n<p>It is also useful for researchers who would like to set standardized thresholds for classifying sentences as either positive, neutral, or negative.<br>\nTypical threshold values (used in the literature cited on this page) are:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>#. <strong>positive sentiment</strong>: <code>compound</code> score &gt;=  0.05\n#. <strong>neutral  sentiment</strong>: (<code>compound</code> score &gt; -0.05) and (<code>compound</code> score &lt; 0.05)\n#. <strong>negative sentiment</strong>: <code>compound</code> score &lt;= -0.05</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>pos</code>, <code>neu</code>, and <code>neg</code> scores are ratios for proportions of text that fall in each category (so these should all add up to be 1... or close to it with float operation).  These are the most useful metrics if you want multidimensional measures of sentiment for a given sentence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>====================================\nPorts to Other Programming Languages</h1>\n<p>Feel free to let me know about ports of VADER Sentiment to other programming languages.

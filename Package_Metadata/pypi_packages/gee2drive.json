The system splits the files if the estimated size is greater than 2GB which is the upper limit and needs the geometry to be parsed in the form of either a fusion table, a user drawn geometry or a table imported into the user's assets. While the javascript frontend is great owing to the queryable catalog whereby you can search and and export your personal and private assets, the limitation lies in batch exports. To resolve this the python API access allows you to call batch export functions but now it is limited to checking for itersects first and running without having a queryable catalog. With the same idea I created this tool which allows you to run a terminal environment where your personal and general catalog images are part of a autosuggest feature. This tool allows you to look for images based on names for example \" you can search for Sentinel and it will show you full path of images which have the word sentinel in the title\". It also creates a report for your image collections and images so apart from the public datasets this can also find your own datasets as well. You can then generate bandlist to make sure all bands you are exporting are of the same type and then export all images that intersect you aoi.\r\n\r\nThe assumption here is\r\n* You have enough free space in your google drive.\r\n* Every image in the give image have the same band structure, choose the bandlist that you know to common to all images\r\n* If the geomery is too complex use the operator feature to use a bounding box instead.\r\n* For now all it filters is geometry and date, and it is does not filter based on metadata (however in the examples folder I have shown how to import and use additional filter before exporting an image collection)\r\n\r\n## Table of contents\r\n* [Installation](#installation)\r\n* [Getting started](#getting-started)\r\n* [Google Earth Engine to Drive Manager](#google-earth-engine-to-drive-manager)\r\n\t* [GEE to Google Drive CLI](#gee-to-google-drive-cli)\r\n    * [gee2drive refresh](#gee2drive-refresh)\r\n    * [gee2drive idsearch](#gee2drive-idsearch)\r\n    * [gee2drive intersect](#gee2drive-intersect)\r\n    * [gee2drive bandtype](#gee2drive-bandtype)\r\n    * [gee2drive export](#gee2drive-export)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nThis assumes that you have native python & pip installed in your system, you can test this by going to the terminal (or windows command prompt) and trying. This assumes that you are also well aware of Google Earth Engine Python setup and have it installed and authetenticated on your system. If not you can [read about it here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install_manual)\r\n\r\n```python``` and then ```pip list```\r\n\r\nIf you get no errors and you have python 2.7.14 or higher you should be good to go. Please note that I have tested this only on python 2.7.15 but can be easily modified for python 3.\r\n\r\nTo install **Python CLI for Digital Ocean** you can install using two methods\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install gee2drive\r\n```\r\n\r\nor try\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install gee2drive --user\r\n```\r\n\r\nor you can also try\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/samapriya/gee2drive.git\r\ncd gee2drive\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation is an optional step; the application can be also run directly by executing gee2drive.py script. The advantage of having it installed is being able to execute ppipe as any command line tool. I recommend installation within virtual environment. If you don't want to install, browse into the gee2drive folder and try ```python gee2drive.py``` to get to the same result.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nAs usual, to print help:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusage: gee2drive [-h] {refresh,idsearch,intersect,bandtype,export} ...\r\n\r\nGoogle Earth Engine to Drive Exporter\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  {refresh,idsearch,intersect,bandtype,export}\r\n    refresh             Refreshes your personal asset list and GEE Asset list\r\n    idsearch            Does possible matches using asset name to give you\r\n                        asseth id/full path\r\n    intersect           Exports a report of all assets(Personal & GEE)\r\n                        intersecting with provided geometry\r\n    bandtype            Prints bandtype and generates list to be used for\r\n                        export\r\n    export              Export Collections based on filter\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo obtain help for a specific functionality, simply call it with _help_ switch, e.g.: `gee2drive idsearch -h`. If you didn't install gee2drive, then you can run it just by going to *gee2drive* directory and running `python gee2drive.py [arguments go here]`\r\n\r\n### GEE to Google Drive CLI\r\nThis tool is designed to augment to the existing facilty of image export using a CLI, whereby you can pass it arguments to filter based on an area of interest geojson file, a start and end date for collection\r\n\r\n### gee2drive refresh\r\nFor the past couple of months I have [maintained a catalog of the most current Google Earth Engine assets](https://github.com/samapriya/Earth-Engine-Datasets-List), within their raster data catalog. I update this list every week. This tool downloads the most current version of this list, and also looks into your personal assets to generate your very own asset report which then serve as a master dataset to feed into autosuggestions.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngee2drive refresh -h\r\nusage: gee2drive refresh [-h]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\r\n```\r\n\r\n### gee2drive idsearch\r\nThere is a possibility that you don't really remember the full path to your asset or the public asset. Fortunately when I parse and collect the image list and path for you they have names that are searchable so use a keyword. for example search using \"MODIS\" or \"sentinel\". Also it is not case sensitive, so you should be able to type \"SENTINEl\" or \"Sentinel\" or \"sentinel\" and it should still work. This matches images based on provider, tags, title and id match.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngee2drive idsearch -h\r\nusage: gee2drive idsearch [-h] [--name NAME]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help   show this help message and exit\r\n  --name NAME  Name or part of name to search for\r\n```\r\n\r\n### gee2drive intersect\r\nThis tool allows you to export a report of every asset present in the Earth Engine dataset list and your personal assets that intersects\r\nwith your geometry. The tool expects you to provide a start and end date and a geometry to filter. The tool uses the bounds() function to use a bounding box incase the geometry has a complex geometry or too many vertices simply use the operator ``bb``. If the geojson/json/kml keeps giving parsing error go to [geojson.io](geojson.io)\r\n\r\n```\r\nusage: gee2drive intersect [-h] [--start START] [--end END] [--aoi AOI]\r\n                              [--report REPORT] [--operator OPERATOR]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help           show this help message and exit\r\n  --start START        Start date to filter image\r\n  --end END            End date to filter image\r\n  --aoi AOI            Full path to geojson/json/kml to be used for bounds\r\n  --report REPORT      Full path where the report will be exported including\r\n                       type, path & number of intersects\r\n\r\nOptional named arguments for geometry only:\r\n  --operator OPERATOR  Use bb for Bounding box incase the geometry is complex\r\n                       or has too many vertices\r\n```\r\n\r\n### gee2drive bandtype\r\nExport requires all the bandtypes to be of the same kind. To do this, I simply generate the band types for you and you can select the band list you want , remember to paste it as a list.\r\n\r\n```\r\nusage: gee2drive bandtype [-h] [--id ID]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\r\n  --id ID     full path for collection or image\r\n```\r\n\r\n### gee2drive export\r\nFinally the export tool, that lets you export an image or a collection clipped to your AOI. This makes use of the bandlist you exported. Incase you are exporting an image and not a collection you don't need a start and end date. The tool uses the bounds() function to use a bounding box incase the geometry has a complex geometry or too many vertices simply use the operator ```bb```. If the geojson/json/kml keeps giving parsing error go to [geojson.io](geojson.io). This tool now also allows you to export table,\r\n\r\n```\r\nusage: gee2drive export [-h] [--id ID] [--folder FOLDER] [--type TYPE]\r\n                        [--aoi AOI] [--start START] [--end END]\r\n                        [--bandlist BANDLIST] [--operator OPERATOR]\r\n                        [--ftype FTYPE]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help           show this help message and exit\r\n  --id ID              Full path for collection or image\r\n  --folder FOLDER      Drive folder path\r\n  --type TYPE          Type whether image or collection\r\n  --aoi AOI            Full path to geojson/json/kml to be used for bounds\r\n\r\nOptional named arguments for image collection only:\r\n  --start START        Start date to filter image\r\n  --end END            End date to filter image\r\n  --bandlist BANDLIST  Bandlist we generated from bandtype export must be same\r\n                       bandtype\r\n  --operator OPERATOR  Use bb for Bounding box incase the geometry is complex\r\n                       or has too many vertices\r\n  --ftype FTYPE        Used only for exporting table choose SHP, KML, KMZ,\r\n                       GeoJSON, TFRECORD\r\n```\r\n\r\nA typical setup would be\r\n```gee2drive export --id \"COPERNICUS/S2\" --folder \"sentinel-export\" --aoi \"C:\\Users\\sam\\boulder.geojson\" --start \"2018-02-01\" --end \"2018-03-01\"\r\n--bandlist ['B2','B3','B4'] --operator \"bb\" --type \"collection\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Changelog\r\n\r\n#### v0.1.0\r\n* Major revision to overall tool and general improvements\r\n* Updated methodology to get private and public asset list.\r\n* Now supports export of table apart from image and image collection.\r\n* Asset search improved to include tags, provider and id path.\r\n\r\n##### v0.0.6\r\n* Now export report of all assets intersecting with geometry & date range\r\n* Minor fixes and general improvements\r\n\r\n##### v0.0.4\r\n* Can now parse geojson, json,kml\r\n* Minor fixes and general improvements\r\n\r\n##### v0.0.3\r\n* Minor Fixes\r\n\r\n\r\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/samapriya/gee2drive", "keywords": "", "license": "Apache 2.0", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "gee2drive", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gee2drive/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gee2drive/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/samapriya/gee2drive"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gee2drive/0.1.0/", "requires_dist": ["earthengine-api (>=0.1.191)", "gitpython (>=2.1.11)", "pendulum (>=2.0.2)", "Pygments (>=2.2.0)", "prettytable (>=0.7.2)", "shapely (>=1.6.4); platform_system != \"Windows\""], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Google Earth Engine to Drive Export Manager", "version": "0.1.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>gee2drive: Download Earth Engine Public and Private assets to Google Drive</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1324456\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"DOI\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/ac55419e8e4ed5fb271e6667d0d4686e4691874f/68747470733a2f2f7a656e6f646f2e6f72672f62616467652f444f492f31302e353238312f7a656e6f646f2e313332343435362e737667\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://badge.fury.io/py/gee2drive\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"PyPI version\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/ca7ac270566869ab198d20357834606629aa9fae/68747470733a2f2f62616467652e667572792e696f2f70792f6765653264726976652e737667\"></a></p>\n<p>Google Earth Engine currently allows you to export images and assets as either GeoTiff files and tables as Shapefiles, GeoJSON, KML, KMZ or TFrecords.

You can see\nexamples of use on Jupyter notebooks in\nhttps://github.com/matthew-brett/cfd2019/tree/master/_ok_exercises.\n\nThe comment notation is as follows:\n\n* An *exercise comment* is any comment beginning ``#-``.  These pass\n  unmodified to the exercise and solution notebooks.\n* An *exercise insertion comment* is any comment beginning ``#<-`` *followed\n  by a space*. The text following will be a line that should not go in the\n  solution, but should go in the exercise.  It allows the template to suggest\n  code to the user, that will not appear in the solution, without\n  modification.  The code after this mark need not be valid syntax.\n* A *both-section marker* is a line consisting of ``#<-`` *followed\n  immediately by a new line character*. This indicates that all subsequent\n  lines, up to the next ``#<-`` line (both-section marker), should go into the\n  exercise and the solution.\n* A *both-line marker* is a line consisting of ``#<--`` *followed immediately\n  by a new line character*.  The next line only goes into the solution and the\n  exercise.\n* If any character other than space, a new line, or a ``-`` follows ``#<-`` at\n  the beginning of a line, this is an error.\n* Any other code lines, including ordinary comments beginning ``#`` get\n  stripped from the template, to form the exercise.  They do appear in the\n  solution.\n* A *marks comment* is a *exercise comment* of form ``#- 5 marks / 100 (total\n  10 marks`` where 5 is the marks for this cell, 100 is the total for the\n  whole exercise, and 10 is the total marks if all correct up to this point\n  (including this cell).\n\nFor example, the template may have a cell like this::\n\n    ```{r}\n    #- Here you will do a simple assignment.\n    #- More description of the assignment.\n    #- 5 marks / 100 (total 10 marks so far).\n    # This comment gets stripped from the exercise version of the cell.\n    # Also this one.  The next line adds the text after #<- to the exercise.\n    #<- my_variable = ...\n    # This comment and the next code line do not appear in the exercise.\n    my_variable = 10\n    #<-\n    # This comment does appear in the exercise, as well as the following code.\n    another_variable = 11\n    print(\"Something\")\n    #<-\n    #<--\n    # This line follows the both-line marker, and appears in the exercise.\n    # This line does not.\n    # Starting at the previous line, we resume normal service.  This and\n    # the next line of comments do not appear in the exercise.\n    ```\n\nThe template cell above results in the following in the exercise version::\n\n    ```{r}\n    #- Here you will do a simple assignment.\n    #- More description of the assignment.\n    #- 5 marks / 100 (total 10 marks so far).\n    my_variable = ...\n    # This comment does appear in the exercise, as well as the following code.\n    another_variable = 11\n    print(\"Something\")\n    # This line follows the both-line marker, and appears in the exercise.\n    ```\n\nThe script ``rmdex`` reads the templates, checks the mark totals (with the\noption ``--check-marks``), and generates the exercise.  It can also generate the solution.  Here are some examples of use:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    # Generate the exercise from the template.\n    rmdex template_notebook.Rmd exercise_notebook.Rmd\n\n    # Generate the exercise and solution from the template.\n    rmdex template_notebook.Rmd exercise_notebook.Rmd solution_notebook.Rmd\n\n    # Check the marks total in the exercise, but do not write the exercise.\n    rmdex --check-marks template_notebook.Rmd\n\n    # Check the marks total in the exercise, and write the exercise.\n    rmdex --check-marks template_notebook.Rmd exercise_notebook.Rmd\n\n    # Write the solution only.\n    rmdex template_notebook.Rmd _ solution_notebook.Rmd\n\n************\nInstallation\n************\n\n::\n\n    pip install rmdex\n\n****\nCode\n****\n\nSee https://github.com/matthew-brett/rmdex\n\nReleased under the BSD two-clause license - see the file ``LICENSE`` in the\nsource distribution.\n\n`travis-ci <https://travis-ci.org/matthew-brett/rmdex>`_ kindly tests the code\nautomatically under Python versions 3.6 through 3.8.\n\nThe latest released version is at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rmdex\n\n*****\nTests\n*****\n\n* Install ``rmdex``;\n* Install the pytest_ testing framework::\n\n    pip install pytest\n\n* Run the tests with::\n\n    pytest rmdex\n\n*******\nSupport\n*******\n\nPlease put up issues on the `rmdex issue tracker`_.\n\n.. standalone-references\n\n.. |rmdex-documentation| replace:: `rmdex documentation`_\n.. _rmdex documentation:\n    https://matthew-brett.github.com/rmdex/index.html\n.. _documentation: https://matthew-brett.github.com/rmdex\n.. _pandoc: https://pandoc.org\n.. _jupyter: https://jupyter.org\n.. _RMarkdown: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com\n.. _R notebooks: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html\n.. _Jupytext: https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext\n.. _homebrew: https://brew.sh\n.. _sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org\n.. _rest: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html\n.. _rmdex issue tracker: https://github.com/matthew-brett/rmdex/issues\n.. _pytest: https://pytest.org", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/matthew-brett/rmdex", "keywords": "", "license": "BSD license", "maintainer": "Matthew Brett", "maintainer_email": "matthew.brett@gmail.com", "name": "rmdex", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/rmdex/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/rmdex/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://github.com/matthew-brett/rmdex"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/rmdex/0.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "Utilities to process exercises in RMarkdown notebooks", "version": "0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"quickstart\">\n<h2>Quickstart</h2>\n<p>The main things this library can do are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>generate an exercise notebook and a solution notebook from a template\nnotebook, given some markup in the comments of the template notebook, and</li>\n<li>check mark totals specified in the comments, to make sure they add up\ncorrectly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The utility expects the comments in <em>code cells</em> to have some extra markup to\ntell it what to do.</p>\n<p>It is equally happy processing <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">R notebooks</a> in <a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">RMarkdown</a> format, or\n<a href=\"https://jupyter.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jupyter</a> notebooks saved as RMarkdown, probably using <a href=\"https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jupytext</a>.

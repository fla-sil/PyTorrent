It is in fact a python script. It specifies the following variables:\n\n* deps: a dictionary of child dependencies to fetch.\n* deps_os: a dictionary of OSes for OS-specific dependencies, each containing a dictionary of child dependencies to fetch.\n* vars: a dictionary of variables to define. Mainly useful to easily override a batch of revisions at once.\n* hooks: hooks to run after a sync.\n* use_relative_paths: relative paths should specify the checkout relative to this directory instead of the root gclient checkout.\n\nAdditional variables are ignored. Special keywords are:\n\n* File(): used for dependencies, specify to expect to checkout a file instead of a directory.\n* From(): used to fetch a dependency definition from another DEPS file, for chaining.\n* Var(): replace this string with a variable defined in vars or overridden.\nPinned deps\n\nEach dependency checkout URL can (and usually does) contain a revision number or git hash, which means you're going to check out and build from that specific revision of the module in question. We call that pinned deps. The advantage is that you can build from a known working revision, even if it comes from a completely different SCM repository or going back in time. The drawback is you have to update the revision number(s) constantly, what we call deps rolls.\n\nDEPS examples\n=============\n\nWebkit's WebKit/chromium/DEPS and Chromium's src/DEPS are fairly complex examples that will show all the possibilities of a DEPS file.\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/cybertk/gclient", "keywords": "git svn repo", "license": "BSD-style License, see LICENSE.txt", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "gclient", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gclient/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gclient/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/cybertk/gclient"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gclient/0.7.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Meta-checkout tool managing both subversion and git checkouts.", "version": "0.7.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            gclient<br>=======<br><br>gclient is a meta-checkout tool managing both subversion and git checkouts.

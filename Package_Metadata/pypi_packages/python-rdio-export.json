It\nincludes a command-line utility script and a library for bundling into\nyour own applications. The command-line utility will output results\nto stdout by default.\n\nIf you like this library and it's saved you some time, please consider\nsupporting further development with a `Gittip donation`_!\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n- requests\n- requests_oauthlib\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install python-rdio-export\n\nAuthentication\n--------------\n\nYou'll need to acquire API credentials from the `Rdio developer site`_.\n\nWhen using the command-line utility you can authenticate with Rdio\none of three ways.\n\nFirst, by providing your credentials to the command-line utility\ndirectly:\n\n::\n    \n    $ rdio-export --user twaddington --id your_client_id --secret your_client_secret\n\nYou can also (optionally) provide your Rdio credentials via two environment\nvariables:\n\n::\n\n    $ export RDIO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n    $ export RDIO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n    \nYou can also (optionally) provide your Rdio credentials via a global config\nfile located in :code:`~/.rdioconfig` with the format:\n\n::\n\n    [Rdio]\n    rdioClientId=your_client_key\n    rdioClientSecret=your_client_secret\n\n..\n\n    Note: Credentials are parsed in the order listed above. For example, the\n    script will first attempt to use credentials provided via the\n    :code:`--id` and :code:`--secret` arguments. Next, credentials will be\n    loaded from the environment variables. Finally, the config file will be\n    examined for credentials.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n    Note: Results will be printed to stdout by default.\n\nExport by username:\n\n::\n\n    $ rdio-export --user twaddington\n\nExport by email:\n\n::\n\n    $ rdio-export --email tristan.waddington@gmail.com\n\nExport to a file:\n\n::\n\n    $ rdio-export --user twaddington > rdio-backup.txt\n\nBug reports\n-----------\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please open a new issue on the project's\n`GitHub page`_.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n::\n\n    Copyright 2014 Tristan Waddington\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n\n\n.. _Gittip donation: https://www.gittip.com/twaddington/\n.. _LICENSE: https://github.com/twaddington/python-rdio-export/blob/master/LICENSE \n.. _GitHub page: https://github.com/twaddington/python-rdio-export\n.. _Rdio developer site: http://www.rdio.com/developers/", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/twaddington/python-rdio-export", "keywords": "rdio export exporter backup cli", "license": "Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

The current package distributed via the PyPI name \npathpy2 supersedes the packages pyTempnets as well as version 1.0 of pathpy.\n\npathpy facilitates the analysis of temporal correlations in time\nseries data on networks. It uses model selection and statistical\nlearning to generate optimal higher- and multi-order models that capture both\ntopological and temporal characteristics. It can help to answer the important \nquestion when a network abstraction of complex systems is\njustified and when higher-order representations are needed instead.\n\nThe theoretical foundation of this package, higher- and multi-order network\nmodels, was developed in the following published works:\n\n1.

It has no platform-specific dependencies\nand should thus work on all platforms. pathpy requires python 3.x. \nIt builds on numpy and scipy. The latest release version 2.0 of pathpy\ncan be installed by typing:\n\npip install pathpy2\n\nPlease make sure that you use the pyPI name pathpy2 as the package name pathpy is currently blocked.\n\nTutorial\n========\n\nA comprehensive 3 hour hands-on tutorial that shows how you can use pathpy \nto analyse data on pathways and temporal networks is available online at:\n\nhttps://ingoscholtes.github.io/kdd2018-tutorial/\n\nAn explanatory video that introduces the science behind pathpy is available here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CxJkVrD2ZlM\n\nA promotional video showcasing some of pathpy's features is available here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QIPqFaR2Z5c \n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nThe code is fully documented via docstrings which are accessible through\npython's built-in help system. Just type help(SYMBOL_NAME) to see\nthe documentation of a class or method. A reference manual is available\nhere https://ingoscholtes.github.io/pathpy/hierarchy.html\n\n\nReleases and Versioning\n=======================\n\nThe first public beta release of pathpy (released February 17 2017) is\nv1.0-beta. Following versions are named MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH according to semantic\nversioning. The current version is 2.0.0.\n\nKnown Issues\n============\n\n- Depending on whether or not scipy has been compiled \n    with or without the numerics package MKL, considerable \n    numerical differences can occur, e.g. for eigenvalue \n    centralities, PageRank, and other measures that depend \n    on the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of matrices. \n    Please refer to scipy.show_config() to show compilation flags.\n- Interactive visualisations in jupyter are currently only \n    supported for juypter notebooks, stand-alone HTML files, \n    and the jupyter display integrated in IDEs like Visual \n    Studio Code (which we highly recommend to work with pathpy). \n    Due to its new widget mechanism, interactive d3js \n    visualisations are currently not available for jupyterLab. \n    Due to the complex document object model generated by \n    jupyter notebooks, visualisation performance is best in \n    stand-alone HTML files and in Visual Studio Code.\n- The visualisation of temporal networks currently does \n    not support the drawing of edge arrows for directed \n    edges. However, a powerful templating mechanism is \n    available to support custom interactive and dynamic \n    visualizations of temporal networks.\n- The visualisation of paths in terms of alluvial diagrams \n    within jupyter is currently unstable for networks with \n    large delay. This is due to the asynchronous loading of \n    external scripts.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n================\n\nThe research behind this data analysis framework was generously funded by the Swiss\nState Secretariate for Education, Research and Innovation via Grant C14.0036. \nThe development of the predecessor package pyTempNets was further supported by the MTEC\nFoundation in the context of the project \"The Influence of Interaction Patterns on\nSuccess in Socio-Technical Systems: From Theory to Practice.\"\n\nThe further development of pathpy is currently supported by the \nSwiss National Science Foundation via Grant 176938.

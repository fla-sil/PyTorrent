{"info": {"author": "Rocky Burt (3.0 support by Reinout van Rees)", "author_email": "reinout@zestsoftware.nl", "bugtrack_url": null, "classifiers": ["Framework :: Plone", "Programming Language :: Python"], "description": "Plone Flash Upload\n==================\n\nPlone Flash Upload is a Plone add-on product which adds an upload tab to\nfolders which takes the user to an upload form. This upload form uses a flash\napplet to provide the ability to upload multiple files simultaneously.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nThe 1.3 version only works on Plone 3.2 or later. Product is compatible\nwith Plone 4.0 and 4.1.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nUse buildout and specify 'Products.PloneFlashUpload' as an egg dependency. (Or\ndepend on it in your own product's setup.py).\n\nOnce Zope is running, go to the Plone site's *Add/Remove Products*\nconfiguration screen and install the *PloneFlashUpload* product.\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\nAfter installation of the product is complete, go to any folder within the\nPlone site and a new *upload* tab should be present if the current user has\naccess to add new files to the folder.\n\nAdditional Notes\n----------------\n\n- The flash applet has been tested (and runs successfully) on MSIE6, MSIE7,\n  Firefox 1.5 (WinXP), Firefox 2.0 (WinXP/Linux) and various Safari and Firefox\n  versions on MacOSX. If a particular browser is found not to work, please\n  submit an issue to the issue tracker.\n\n- Any file that is uploaded will try to use the content type registry to\n  determine what portal type should be the result of the file being uploaded\n  (ie jpg's created as Image's and random binary files created as File's). It\n  should be observed though that only portal types defined within the PFU\n  configlet are possible candidates (ie add more here if you have additional\n  custom types you are using and have registered with CTR).\n\nIssue Tracker, SVN, Other Resources\n-----------------------------------\n\nProject Homepage\n  http://plone.org/products/ploneflashupload\n\nIssue Tracker\n  http://plone.org/products/ploneflashupload/issues\n\nSource Control Repository\n  http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PloneFlashUpload\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTo run the Plone Flash Upload tests you must use the standard Zope testrunner::\n\n  ./bin/instance test -s Products.PloneFlashUpload\n\nSWFUpload integration\n---------------------\n\nAttempting to wedge SWFUpload 2.2 into PloneFlashUpload in an effort\nto resolve problems with Flash 10.\n\nSee http://swfupload.org/\n\nStatus\n~~~~~~\n\nFirst pass integration of SWFUpload 2.2.0 Beta 2 using. Largely replicates\nthe original behavior of PloneFlashUpload. Targeting:\n\n- Plone 3.1 (Uses jquery - support for older versions of Plone would require\n  jquery to be included.)\n\n- Flash 9 or 10. (SWFUpload version 2.2 drops support for Flash 8.)\n\nNext up is a wider browser testing. Tested and works with:\n\n- Flash 9,0,124,0, Mac OS X 10.5, Safari 3.1 and Firefox 3.0\n\n- Flash 10, Windows x64, Firefox 3.0, IE 7, Chrome 0.3.154.9\n\n- Flash 9,0,124,0, Windows XP SP 2, IE 7\n\nTodo\n~~~~\n\n- Wider browser based testing.\n\n- Update documentation to reference use of SWFUpload and it's licensing.\n\n- Style the Upload queue.\n\n- Move the JavaScript into resource registries.\n\n- Provide a simple switch to enable debug.\n\n- Use SWFObject for loading the Flash object to provide warnings about old\n  versions of Flash? Is there already a SWFObject plugin for Plone?\n\n- portal_status_message (ploneflashupload.js) is used in the pre 3.0-way. This\n  will need to be changed to the new cookie-based mechanism.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis product and it's contents are covered under the Zope Public License\n(ZPL).

Sponsored by http://www.innovationz.org.\n\nRamon Bartl (ramonski), inquant fixed lots of bugs.\n\nMike Trachtman kudos for doing the original experimental branch to getting\nswfupload working with PloneFlashUpload.\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.3 (2011-09-01)\n----------------\n\n- Load CMF permissions.zcml when on Plone 4.1 so the instance can start.\n  [maurits]\n\n- Added Plone 4.1 compatible formbase import.\n  [maciej.zieba]\n\n\n1.3b2 (2010-07-02)\n------------------\n\n- Compatibility with Plone 4.

Each classroom gets it's own blog, along with templates for the blog, subtemplates for individual posts so that attachments can be displayed in sensical ways. This blog portion draws heavily from django-articles by codekoala on Github.\n\nThere's also room for classroom photos (the most recent one goes to the top of the default template, so you can change them seasonally), galleries of photos (via django-photologue) and probably more features that will come as the app is built.\n\nThat's it for now.\n\nInstall\n---------\n\n```\npip install django-classroom\n```\n\nElse you could follow whatever procedure you use to install python packakges (easy_install, etc)\n\nConfiguration\n--------------\n\nCurrently there is little to configure.

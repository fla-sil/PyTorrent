Its real power lays in modular nature of objects, such as WFSs, DMs and reconstructors which can be taken and used as building blocks to construct new and complex AO ideas and configurations.\n\nPlease keep in mind that soapy is very much a work-in-progress and under heavy development. I've not yet settled on a completely stable API, but I will try and say when something big has changed. **For these reasons I would strongly reccomend against using soapy for critical work and would suggest contacting me to discuss its suitability for any work to be published.**\n\nThere is documentation at http://soapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, again this is also being developed at this time!\n\n## Quick-Start\n\n\nTry out some of the code examples in the ``conf`` directory, either run the ``soapy`` script in ``bin``, or load a python or IPython terminal: \n\n    import soapy\n    sim = soapy.Sim(\"configFilename\")\n    sim.aoinit()\n    sim.makeIMat()\n    sim.aoloop()\n    \nAll the data from the simulation exists in the ``sim`` object, the data available will depend upon parameters set in the configuration file. e.g. Slopes can be accessed by ``sim.allSlopes``.\n\n## Required Libraries\nSoapy doesn't have too many requirements in terms of external libraries, though it does rely on some. There are also some optional libraries which are recommended for plotting or performance.\n\n### Required\n\n    numpy => 1.7.0\n    scipy => 0.10\n    pyfits *or* astropy\n    pyfftw\n    numba\n    aotools\n    \n### For GUI\n\n    PyQt5 (attempted to be compatibile with PyQt4 but not guaranteed)\n    pyqtgraph (http://www.pyqtgraph.org)\n    matplotlib\n    ipython\n\nIf your starting with python from scratch, there a couple of options. For Ubuntu linux (14.04+) users, all these packages can be installed via apt-get and pip:\n    \n    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-pyfftw python-astropy python-qt4 python-matplotlib ipython ipython-qtconsole python-pyqtgraph\n    pip install aotools\n\nFor Red-hat based systems these packages should also be available from repositories, though I'm not sure of their names. \n    \nfor mac os, all of these packages can be install via macports and pip, with\n    \n    sudo port install python27 py27-numpy py27-scipy py27-astropy py27-pyfftw py27-pyqt4 py27-ipython py27-pyqtgraph py27-jupyter\n    pip install aotools\n    \nFor any OS (including Windows), python distributions exist which include lots of python packages useful for science.

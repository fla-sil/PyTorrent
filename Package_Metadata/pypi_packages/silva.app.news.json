This object is used\nonly to manage those lists (subjects and target audiences), these will\nfunction as criteria for the newsfilters (more on these later in this\ndocument) to search on. It would be best to add as much subjects and\ntarget audiences as currently available to the service when setting up\nNews, since the lists are the basis of the filtering system and one\nhas to dive into the ZMI to add items (therefore it requires\nappropriate rights to edit stuff in the ZMI).  Managing these lists is\nquite straightforward: you can add an item by filling in a string into\none of the textfields and pressing on the corresponding 'add' button,\nand remove them by checking the checkbox in front of an item and\nclicking the corresponding 'remove' button.\n\nAdding a News Publication\n-------------------------\n\nNewsitems can only be added to newspublication. To add one, go to the\nSMI and choose 'Silva News Publication' from the menu of addables\n(upper left corner of the edit tab in folders, publications and the\nSilva root). Enter an id and a title and choose 'Add and edit', you\nwill then be taken to the edit tab of the newspublication.  This tab\nlooks a lot like the edit tab of other containers (folders,\npublications) in Silva, except it doesn't have a default document or\nview and can not contain anything other then news items (articles and\nagenda items), folders and publications (thus allowing a more\nstructured setup of the newspublication).You can add newsitems by\nchoosing a specific type from the addables menu in this tab.\n\nProperties tab\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn the properties tab of newspublication there is a checkbox called\n'restrict access'. When this is checked, the folder can only be found\nby news- and agendafilters in the same folder the folder is on and\neach subfolder of that folder. This can be used to make the\nnewspublication 'private', making it available only to for example 1\ndepartment.\n\nAdding news items\n-----------------\n\nNow authors can add newsitems. As stated before, there are two types\nof newsitems: articles and agendaitems. The main differences are that\nagendaitems must contain a date/time on which the event described in\nthem takes place, and contain a location on which the event takes\nplace. The start date/time is necessary to show the items in\nagendaviewers, since they show the items for a particular period\n(e.g. a month). Therefore agendaviewers can show only\nagendaitems. Newsviewers are capable of showing both articles and\nagendaitems. Other datafields required for the system to work\ncorrectly are 'subjects' and 'target audiences', which the author can\nuse to classify the newsitem. These fields will later be used by the\nnewsfilters as criteria for routing the items to newsviewers. When\nediting an article or agenda item, keep in mind that the first heading\nplaced in the content editor is considered to be the subheader of the\nnewsitem, and the first paragraph as the lead (both will show up in\nthe preview on the viewers).\n\nAdding news filters\n-------------------\n\nThe next thing to do to make the system work is adding one or more\nnews- and agendafilters. These are objects used by editors or chief-\neditors to filter a stream of newsitems. The items can be filtered on\nsubject and target audience (so for instance a newsfilter can route\nonly newsitems with a specific subject or meant for a specific target\naudience to the viewers) and/or individually (per newsitem). Another\nfeature of the filters is the ability to 'stick to the current path',\nwhen set this makes the filters pick up items only if they're in a\nsubdirectory of the filter's container.\n\nThe Filters' edit tab\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe contents tab of a newsfilter shows a list of all available\nnewspublications (excluding the ones made private by checking the\n'restrict access' checkbox that are not in the same folder or a\nparentfolder of the newsfilter). To route newsitems of a\nnewspublication to newsviewers (more about those later) make sure the\ncheckbox in front of the newspublication is checked and click the\n'update sources' button. All (published) newsitems that conform to the\ncriteria of the newsfilter will then be routed to the newsviewers that\nuse this filter. These criteria can be set in the 'Properties' tab of\nthe newsfilter: you see the lists of subjects and target audiences of\nservice_news again, and in newsfilters also a couple of radiobuttons\nto select whether the filter should route agendaitems as well as\narticles. These criteria can be used to distribute articles and\nagendaitems in different ways across the Silva instance to\nnewsviewers.\n\nFor example: a number of different newspublications can contain both\narticles and agendaitems of different subjects and targeting different\naudiences, and the newsfilters filter and distribute specific items to\nviewers. Please note that this means that filters must be sensibly set\nup for the site to allow all newsitems to be shown somewhere: it is\nvery easy to set up the system in a way that articles and agendaitems\nwith a specific subject or target audience are filtered out by all\nnewsfilters, and therefore be excluded from all viewers.\n\nThe Items tab\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe 'Items' tab can be used to filter out specific items, to allow\neditors and chiefeditors to disallow specific articles and agendaitems\nto be routed by a filter. To filter out a specific item, uncheck the\ncheckbox in front of it and choose 'update'.\n\nNow the news- and agendaviewers can be placed. The viewers are the\nobjects responsible for showing the articles and agendaitems to the\npublic. An author can place viewers where he wants news to be shown.\nThe viewers show a list of items routed by the filters.\n\nThe Viewer's Edit tab\n---------------------\n\nThe viewers are quite easy to set up: the only tab that matters is the\nfirst one (edit), where you can set the number of days the viewer will\nlook back (for newsviewers) or ahead (for agendaviewers) to get\nitems. In the case of newsviewers there is also a switch to choose a\nnumber of items to be shown. Also there is a list of available\nfilters. All filters chosen here are used for retrieving news. When\nplaced, the viewers will be available to the public and show articles\nand/or agendaitems, together with an archive (that allows showing\nitems for a particular month) and a search option.\n\nAppending /rss to the URL of a NewsViewer will show the RSS 1.0 (RDF\ncompliant) view of the items in this viewer.\n\nThe RSSAggregator\n-----------------\n\nThe RSSAggregator replaces the old (and now removed) RSSViewer. In the\nedit screen you'll see a textbox called 'RSS feeds' where you can enter\nthe complete URLs for the feeds you want to have merged by this\naggregator instance.\n\nAll the other functionality is the same as for News Viewers.\n\n\nCode repository\n===============\n\nYou can find the code of this extension in Git:\nhttps://github.com/silvacms/silva.app.news\n\n.. _Silva: http://silvacms.org\n\nChangeLog\n=========\n\n3.0.4 (2013/12/19)\n------------------\n\n- Change how the dates are displayed in agenda and news items: no\n  longer properly translate them using the local setting.

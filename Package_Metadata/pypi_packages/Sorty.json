Sorty sorts files in a\r\nfolder by their extensions and organizes stuff. Sorty is built in Python\r\nand works cross platform.\r\n\r\nWhy Sorty?\r\n~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nSorty shouldn't be used in project folders or code folders. It's better\r\nfor organising folders like Downloads, Pictures, Trip Media etc.\r\n\r\nFor example, we download a lot of stuff in our computers. Most of the\r\ntime, our download folder is a mess.\r\n\r\nBut worry not because Sorty is here!. Sorty sorts your files based on\r\nyour extensions and groups similar files together. So your program setup\r\nfiles are in one folder, your PDF documents are in one, and your\r\ndownloaded songs are in another. You can then rename these folders to\r\nsuit yourself.\r\n\r\nAnother Example, whenever we go out for a holiday or a trip, we take a\r\nlot of pictures and videos. But when we import our files from our Camera\r\nor Smartphone, the videos and pictures are grouped together. And\r\nseparating them takes time especially when we have many files. Again,\r\nSorty to the rescue!. Sorty will group your videos separately and your\r\npictures separately.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nCross Platform\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nYou need to have Python installed for this method. It will work on\r\nWindows, Unix/Linux and Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nUse ``pip`` to install:\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n    pip install sorty\r\n\r\nInstaller\r\n^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nThe Installer is coming soon for Windows. It will be a small exe that\r\nyou need to place in your system folder and you are good to go.\r\n\r\nLinux and Mac OS X don't get a compiled executable because Python is pre\r\ninstalled in these systems\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\nNavigate to the Folder which you want to sort in your Terminal/Command\r\nPrompt\r\n\r\nEnter the following command:\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n    sorty\r\n\r\nAnd the Magic will start. By default Sorty does not sort files contained\r\nin subfolders but if you want that, just add the ``--topdown`` argument\r\nso that the command becomes:\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n    sorty --topdown\r\n\r\nAlternatively instead of navigating to the folder, you can let sorty do\r\nthat for you using the ``directory`` argument.\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n    sorty -d \"C:\\Pictures\" --topdown\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nIf you have Python >2.7 and >3.2 then there are no external\r\ndependencies. To Support Python 2.5 - 2.6 and 3.0 - 3.1, the\r\n``argparse`` module is required. If you are installing using pip then\r\ndon't worry, everything will be installed automatically.\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\nCreated By Pradipta.

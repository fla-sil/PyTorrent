All your documents and folders are visible; you can\ncopy documents to and from the reMarkable, create folders, and move and delete\nfolders and files. You cannot, however, edit documents that are\nalready on the reMarkable (apart from moving or deleting them).\n\nIt supports PDF files, EPUB files, and handwritten notes, but does not\nyet support annotated PDFs (they are exported without annotations).\n\n*This software is in an early stage of development. I take no responsibility if\nit deletes your files or bricks your reMarkable! Do not use it if you are\nunwilling to lose all your documents. Use at your own risk!*\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n``remarkable-fs`` works on both Linux and macOS. Support for macOS may\nbe a bit patchy as I myself run Linux, but at least the basics should\nwork. To install it, you will need to have first installed:\n\n- FUSE. If on macOS, get this from the `Fuse for macOS`_ project. If\n  on Linux, your package manager should have it.\n- ``pip``, the Python package installer. You can install this by running\n  ``sudo easy_install pip`` in a terminal.\n\n.. _Fuse for macOS: https://osxfuse.github.io/\n\nThen, to install ``remarkable-fs``, run the following command in a\nterminal:\n\n  sudo pip install remarkable-fs\n\nNote for Linux users: ``remarkable-fs`` supports both Python 2 and 3,\nbut for handwritten notes it works much faster on *Python 2*.\n\nRunning\n-------\n\nMake an empty directory on your computer. This directory is where your\ndocuments will appear. Then run ``remarkable-fs``. You will be\nprompted for the path to this directory; type it in. (On macOS, you\ncan instead drag the directory to the terminal window at this point.)\n\nYou will then be prompted for the root password of your reMarkable.\nYou can find this by opening the settings menu of the reMarkable,\nchoosing \"About\", scrolling to the very bottom, and finding the\nparagraph beginning: \"To do so, this device acts as a USB ethernet\ndevice...\" (If you don't want to have to type in the root password\nevery time you run ``remarkable-fs``, follow the instructions on\npasswordless login from the `reMarkable wiki`_.)\n\n.. _reMarkable wiki: http://remarkablewiki.com/index.php?title=Methods_of_access#Setting_up_ssh-keys\n\nIf all goes well, you will find all your documents in the directory\nyou chose. You can copy PDF or EPUB files there, and they will appear\non the reMarkable; you can also move files around. Go wild!\n\n(On macOS, your reMarkable will also appear in the finder under the\nmenu Go -> Computer.)\n\nWhen you are finished, you can stop ``remarkable-fs`` by pressing ctrl-C.\n\nNote that your reMarkable will be unresponsive for the time you have\n``remarkable-fs`` running. It should start responding as soon as you close\n``remarkable-fs`` or unplug the USB cable. If for some reason it doesn't, you\ncan force your reMarkable to restart by holding down the power button for five\nseconds, letting go, and then pressing the power button for another second.\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nThe software is licensed under the MIT licence, apart from the file\nremarkable_fs/rM2svg.py.

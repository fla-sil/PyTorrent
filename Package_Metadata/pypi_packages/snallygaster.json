There's no particular\nbackstory why this tool got named this way, other than that I was looking for a fun and\ninteresting name.\n\nI thought a name of some mythical creature would be nice, but most of those had the problem\nthat I would have had name collisions with other software. Checking the list of dragons on\nWikipedia I learned about the Snallygaster. The name sounded funny, the idea that there are\ndragon legends in the US interesting and I found no other piece of software with that name.\n\ncredit and thanks\n=================\n\n* Thanks to Tim Philipp Sch\u00e4fers and Sebastian Neef from the\n  [Internetwache](https://www.internetwache.org/) for plenty of ideas about things to look\n  for.\n* Thanks to [Craig Young](https://secur3.us/) for many discussions during the\n  development of this script.\n* Thanks to [Sebastian Pipping](https://blog.hartwork.org/) for some help with Python\n  programming during the development.\n* Thanks to [Benjamin Balder Bach](https://overtag.dk/) for teaching me lots of\n  things about Python packaging.\n* Thanks to the organizers of Bornhack, Driving IT, SEC-T and the Rights and Freedom track at\n  34C3 for letting me present this work.\n\nauthor\n======\n\nsnallygaster is developed and maintained by [Hanno B\u00f6ck](https://hboeck.de/).\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/hannob/snallygaster", "keywords": "security,vulnerability,http", "license": "CC0", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "snallygaster", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/snallygaster/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/snallygaster/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/hannob/snallygaster"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/snallygaster/0.0.6/", "requires_dist": ["urllib3", "beautifulsoup4", "dnspython"], "requires_python": ">=3", "summary": "Tool to scan for secret files on HTTP servers", "version": "0.0.6", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>snallygaster</h1>\n<p>Tool to scan for secret files on HTTP servers</p>\n<h1>what?</h1>\n<p>snallygaster is a tool that looks for files accessible on web servers that shouldn't be public\nand can pose a security risk.</p>\n<p>Typical examples include publicly accessible git repositories, backup files potentially containing\npasswords or database dumps.

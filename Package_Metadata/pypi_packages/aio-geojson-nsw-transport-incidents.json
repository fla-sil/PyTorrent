The feed manager will keep track of all feed entries' \n  external IDs that it has successfully processed.\n* If the current feed update is not the first one, then the feed manager will \n  produce three sets:\n  * Feed entries that were not in the previous feed update but are in the \n    current feed update will be reported as new.\n  * Feed entries that were in the previous feed update and are still in the \n    current feed update will be reported as to be updated.\n  * Feed entries that were in the previous feed update but are not in the \n    current feed update will be reported to be removed.\n* If the current update fails, then all feed entries processed in the previous\n  feed update will be reported to be removed.\n\nAfter a successful update from the feed, the feed manager provides two\ndifferent dates:\n\n* `last_update` will be the timestamp of the last update from the feed \n  irrespective of whether it was successful or not.\n* `last_update_successful` will be the timestamp of the last successful update \n  from the feed. This date may be useful if the consumer of this library wants \n  to treat intermittent errors from feed updates differently.\n* `last_timestamp` (optional, depends on the feed data) will be the latest \n  timestamp extracted from the feed data. \n  This requires that the underlying feed data actually contains a suitable \n  date. This date may be useful if the consumer of this library wants to \n  process feed entries differently if they haven't actually been updated.\n\n\n## Attribution and motivation\nThis is a fork of [exxamalte/python-aio-geojson-nsw-rfs-incidents](https://github.com/exxamalte/python-aio-geojson-nsw-rfs-incidents). \nIt deferes mainly as the geoJSON feeds generated by NSW Transport using QGis.  QGis generates files that don't match exactly geojson format (geometry types : `POINT` instead of `Point`)\n\nThis library has been created for [Home Assistant component](https://github.com/Fred-Ch/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/nsw_transport_incident_service_feed).\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/Fred-Ch/python-aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents-master", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/Fred-Ch/python-aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents-master"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents/0.1/", "requires_dist": ["aio-geojson-client (>=0.13)", "aiohttp (>=3.5.4)", "pytz (>=2019.01)"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "An async GeoJSON client library for NSW Transport Service Incidents.", "version": "0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>python-aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/Fred-Ch/python-aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents-master\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Build Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/6ccb11286541e2812506af7839240c0b74dfd55e/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f467265642d43682f707974686f6e2d61696f2d67656f6a736f6e2d6e73772d7472616e73706f72742d696e636964656e74732d6d61737465722e737667\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"PyPi\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/2a30ba2ae337438692a56069836e99e18760e932/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f707970692f762f61696f2d67656f6a736f6e2d6e73772d7472616e73706f72742d696e636964656e74732e737667\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Version\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/adfe2621354200b7760e3e6128bad544a06e62c8/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f707970692f707976657273696f6e732f61696f2d67656f6a736f6e2d6e73772d7472616e73706f72742d696e636964656e74732e737667\"></a></p>\n<p>This library provides convenient async access to the <a href=\"https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/dataset/live-traffic-site-status\" rel=\"nofollow\">NSW Transport Service Live traffic status</a> incidents feed.\nThe feed can be seen online on (<a href=\"https://www.livetraffic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.livetraffic.com/</a>)</p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p><code>pip install aio-geojson-nsw-transport-incidents</code></p>\n<h2>Usage</h2>\n<p>See below for examples of how this library can be used.

The feed manager will keep track of all feed entries'\nexternal IDs that it has successfully processed.</li>\n<li>If the current feed update is not the first one, then the feed manager will\nproduce three sets:\n<ul>\n<li>Feed entries that were not in the previous feed update but are in the\ncurrent feed update will be reported as new.</li>\n<li>Feed entries that were in the previous feed update and are still in the\ncurrent feed update will be reported as to be updated.</li>\n<li>Feed entries that were in the previous feed update but are not in the\ncurrent feed update will be reported to be removed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If the current update fails, then all feed entries processed in the previous\nfeed update will be reported to be removed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After a successful update from the feed, the feed manager provides two\ndifferent dates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>last_update</code> will be the timestamp of the last update from the feed\nirrespective of whether it was successful or not.</li>\n<li><code>last_update_successful</code> will be the timestamp of the last successful update\nfrom the feed. This date may be useful if the consumer of this library wants\nto treat intermittent errors from feed updates differently.</li>\n<li><code>last_timestamp</code> (optional, depends on the feed data) will be the latest\ntimestamp extracted from the feed data.\nThis requires that the underlying feed data actually contains a suitable\ndate. This date may be useful if the consumer of this library wants to\nprocess feed entries differently if they haven't actually been updated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Attribution and motivation</h2>\n<p>This is a fork of <a href=\"https://github.com/exxamalte/python-aio-geojson-nsw-rfs-incidents\" rel=\"nofollow\">exxamalte/python-aio-geojson-nsw-rfs-incidents</a>.\nIt deferes mainly as the geoJSON feeds generated by NSW Transport using QGis.

Represent both ARM and GCM columns in the Python programming\n   language building on the Atmospheric Community Toolkit (ACT, Theisen et. al. 2019)\n   and leveraging the EMC2 team\u2019s success with Py-ART (Helmus and Collis 2016).\n2. Scale GCM outputs (using the cloud fraction) to compare with sub-grid-scale column measurements\n   using a modular sub column generator (Lamer 2018) which will be designed to run off-line on\n   time series extracted from existing GCM/SCM output.\n3. Enable a suite of comparisons between ARM (and other) column measurements and\n   the GCM model subcolumns.\n\nThe work is inspired by the (GO)2SIM (Lamer et al. 2018) in which a sample of NASA ModelE3 global\nsimulation was analyzed over the North Slope of Alaska (NSA) site at Utqiagvik, Alaska.\nFor this initial development, a forward model was applied directly to the grid cell mean\nprofiles and areas of different hydrometeors were converted to observational units using a\nvariety of techniques. The forward-simulated phase identification was then compared with the\nactual model phase, demonstrating that significant differences exist between true model phase\nand forward-simulated phase owing to a number of factors, including factors such as lidar attenuation,\nradar sensitivity, and trace quantities of liquid that would not be observable. It is therefore\nparticularly important to project true model phase into forward-modeled phase in order to perform\na robust evaluation against available observations.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIn order to install EMC^2, you can use either pip or anaconda. In a terminal, simply type either of::\n\n$ pip install emc2\n$ conda install -c conda-forge emc2\n\nIn addition, if you want to build EMC^2 from source and install, type in the following commands::\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/columncolab/EMC2\n$ cd EMC2\n$ pip install .\n\nRequirements\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nEMC^2 requires Python 3.6+ as well as: \n   * Atmoshperic Community Toolkit (https://arm-doe.github.io/ACT). \n   * Numpy (https://numpy.org)\n   * Scipy (https://scipy.org)\n   * Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org)\n   * Xarray (http://xarray.pydata.org)\n\nLicence\n-------\n\nCopyright 2019 Authors\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

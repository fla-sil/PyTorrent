Especially with formats that get can be manually modified there is a chance for corrupted files that don't fit the format anymore. \n        If corrupted files are able to enter the workflow undetected the whole system can break and may have to be reset, even if it doesn't break the result gotten at the end will not be usable and all the work done will have to be repeated.\n        In the second case you may get an even worse situation if the mistake is not found quickly. All further work and conclusions building on the corrupted result might also be unusable. \n        \n        To combat this situation there are validators for different formats that are able to make sure they conform to all the defined rules. For example there is [FastaValidator](https://github.com/jwaldman/FastaValidator) and the [FastqValidator](https://github.com/statgen/fastQValidator) which both can validate their respective formats. There are also programs that not only validate certain formats but also allow to run analysis on them like [bamUtil](https://github.com/statgen/bamUtil)\n        \n        Yet there are no tools that concentrate on validating a broad range of formats that would allow to have a single program that validates all of the different files going into a workflow. Instead currently it is needed to have multiple tools which all need to be maintained.   \n        \n        In order to address this issue we started creating *valifor* a command line application that will be able to validate different NGS file formats while it's currently a small start, it's easily extensible and a needed format can quickly be added.\n        \n        Table of Contents\n        =======================\n        \n        * [The overall architecture](#toa)\n        * [Installation](#install)\n        * [The command line interface](#cli)\n        * [Adding a new Format](#addFormat)\n        \n        <a name=\"toa\">The overall architecture </a>\n        =======================\n        The *valifor* architecture is shown in the following graph: \n        \n        ![valifor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35918514/42245707-01840510-7f1a-11e8-8860-20ea51f056b9.jpg)\n        \n        \n        The basic structure is the factory pattern.\n        \n        Following the flow of information the command line interface receives the input of one ore multiple paths to files/directories to validate and optionally the format which it should check.\n        This is used to start the validation process in the main logic. There the factory is used to get the correct validator for the needed format from the child-classes of AbsValidator.\n        The AbsValidator is the base class for all implemented validators. Each of the child-classes has to implement the interface given in the parent. \n        The validator given by the factory is then used to validate the files and it returns information about if the files are valid and if not where the format is broken. \n        \n        \n        <a name=\"install\">Installation </a>\n        =======================\n        You can install *valifor* using the source files found on [Github](https://github.com/qbicsoftware/dmqb-grp1-2018)\n        \n        After you downloaded the directory you can call:\n            \n            $ pip install path_to_the_directory\n        \n        to install it on your system.\n        \n        \n        <a name=\"cli\">Using Valifor: </a>\n        ========================\n        \n        Once *valifor* is installed, it can be used. \n        You can get an overview on how to use it by adding the  ``--help`` option in the command line. It will show an overview and explanation for *valifor*:\n        \n            $ valifor --help\n            Usage: valifor [OPTIONS] [PATHS]...\n        \n            Welcome to the format validator Valifor:\n        \n            Valifor is a easily extensible validator for different formats.

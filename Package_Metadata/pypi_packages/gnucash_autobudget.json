This is tedious, especially when your transactions are already\nbloated with currency adjustment data.\n\nSo I take the in my opinion cleanest (I don't know much about accounting,\nthough) `method of envelope budgeting`__ with GnuCash and use GnuCash Autobudget\nto automatically add budgeting entries to transactions.\n\n__ https://www.reddit.com/r/GnuCash/comments/3z5b6m/ynab_method_of_budgeting_with_gnucash/czvmtdd\n\n\nAccount setup\n-------------\n\nPlease read the Reddit post linked above first and create some transactions\naccording to that method, so that you get a feel for it.\n\nGnuCash Autobudget expects a setup similar to the one shown there::\n\n    Assets                      asset\n        Cash                    asset\n    Expenses                    expense     mandatory\n        Daily                   expense\n            Groceries           expense\n            Beer                expense\n            Transportation      expense\n        Monthly                 expense\n            Rent                expense\n    Budget                      asset       mandatory\n        Budgeted Funds          liability   mandatory\n        Available to Budget     asset       mandatory \n        Daily                   asset\n            Groceries           asset\n            Transportation      asset\n        Monthly                 asset\n            Rent                asset\n        \n        \nFor GnuCash Autobudget to work, you must have the mandatory accounts and they\nmust have the same name as listed above. The other accounts are only for\nillustration and you can structure and name them as you want. Note, though, that\nGnuCash Autobudget relies on the correspondence of subaccount names under\nExpenses and Budget. Namely\u2026\n\nGnuCash Autobudget only looks at subaccounts of Expenses that have a\ncorresponding subaccount in Budget. So for example, ``Expenses:Daily:Groceries``\ncorresponds to ``Budget:Daily:Groceries``. If there is no corresponding\nsubaccount for an account in Expenses, GnuCash Autobudget will ignore it. For\nexample, it will ignore ``Expenses:Daily:Beer``.\n\n\nWhat does it do?\n----------------\n\nWhen GnuCash looks through those accounts, it looks for transactions that don't\nhave a budget entry. Like this::\n\n    #                          debit  credit\n    Expenses:Daily:Groceries   100\n    Assets:Cash                       100\n\nIt then adds budget entries to them::\n\n    Expenses:Daily:Groceries   100\n    Assets:Cash                       100\n    Budget:Budgeted Funds      100\n    Budget:Daily:Groceries            100\n\nThat means you can record your transactions as usual and GnuCash Autobudget adds\nthe obvious information, so that your budgeting accounts will show the right\ninformation. Of course, GnuCash Autobudget won't touch transactions that already\nhave a budget entry.\n\n\nSplit transactions\n------------------\n\nGnuCash Autobudget can also deal with split transactions. Input::\n\n    Expenses:Daily:Food        70\n    Expenses:Daily:Drink       10\n    Assets:Cash                       80\n\nOutput::\n\n    Expenses:Daily:Food        70\n    Expenses:Daily:Drink       10\n    Assets:Cash                       80\n    Budget:Budgeted Funds      80\n    Budget:Daily:Food                 70\n    Budget:Daily:Drink                10\n\nMulti-currency splits work, too. Input::\n\n    #                                debit  credit\n    Expenses:Daily:Groceries         2 \u20ac\n    Currency Trading:CURRENCY:JPY    250\n    Assets:Cash:Yen                         250\n    Currency Trading:CURRENCY:EUR           2 \u20ac\n    \nOutput::\n\n    Expenses:Daily:Groceries         2 \u20ac\n    Currency Trading:CURRENCY:JPY    250\n    Assets:Cash:Yen                         250\n    Currency Trading:CURRENCY:EUR           2 \u20ac\n    Budget:Budgeted Funds            2 \u20ac\n    Budget:Daily:Groceries                  2 \u20ac\n\n\nWish list poll\n--------------\n\nThere are some GitHub issues labelled ``wish list``. They denote things I might\nimplement in the future. You can encourage me to implement a certain feature by\ncommenting on the issue. Of course, you can also add items to the wish list.\n\n\nCopyright and License\n---------------------\n\nSee ``LICENSE.txt``.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/rmoehn/gnucash_autobudget", "keywords": "GnuCash budget YNAB", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "gnucash_autobudget", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gnucash_autobudget/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gnucash_autobudget/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/rmoehn/gnucash_autobudget"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gnucash_autobudget/0.1.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Automatically adjust GnuCash transactions for envelope budgeting", "version": "0.1.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"contents\">\n<p>Contents</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#installation\" id=\"id3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Installation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#usage\" id=\"id4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Usage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#idea\" id=\"id5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Idea</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#account-setup\" id=\"id6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Account setup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#what-does-it-do\" id=\"id7\" rel=\"nofollow\">What does it do?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#split-transactions\" id=\"id8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Split transactions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#wish-list-poll\" id=\"id9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wish list poll</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#copyright-and-license\" id=\"id10\" rel=\"nofollow\">Copyright and License</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"installation\">\n<h2><a href=\"#id3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Installation</a></h2>\n<p>You need the <a href=\"http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Python_Bindings\" rel=\"nofollow\">GnuCash Python bindings</a> installed on your computer.

We hope\nto stand on the shoulders of giants.\n\n## Overview\n\nAt blt's root is the concept of a ``tool``, blt provides several tools out of\nthe box. Currently we have support for:\n\n* AWS (S3)\n* Django\n* Heroku\n* South (django database migrations)\n\nThese tools encapsulate commands that you would want to interface with each\nsystem. For example, you might want to be able to push files to an S3 bucket\nwith the AWS tool, or you might want to run a migration using the South tool.\nblt standardizes the interface for running the command and handles things like\nconfiguration injection so you can easily differentiate between dev/staging/prod\nsettings when running a command.\n\n## Real-world Example\n\nLet's take a quick look at a practical example of blt in action. Here is a sample\ncommand for running an AWS S3 sync on our staging environment:\n\n```bash\nblt e:staging aws.sync_s3 /path/to/my/dir\n```\n\nThat's it! Running that command will pick up the staging environment\nconfiguration, connect to S3, determine the changed files between the S3 bucket\nand the files in /path/to/my/dir, and push them up to AWS. blt is able to\nautomatically grab things like AWS authentication keys for staging and inject\nthe settings into the runtime so blt can connect to the bucket. Pretty sweet!\n\n## blt Grammar\n\nblt has an opinionated command grammar and enforces a strict way of running\ncommands for tools. blt was designed to have a consistent run style so that no\nmatter what tool you are running commands for, it will have the same basic\nformat.  Let's break down the aws run from above:\n\n         blt          e:staging     aws       .       sync_s3    /path/to/my/dir\n          ^               ^          ^        ^          ^              ^\n          |               |          |        |          |              |\n          |               |          |        |          |              |\n\n    blt executable   environment    tool   separator  command         args\n\n## Installation\n\nCurrently blt is not on PyPI, so you'll need to build/install from the filesystem. Here are the steps to accomplish this:\n\n#### Clone the blt rep\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:pubvest/utils.git\n```\n\n#### Run the sdist directive on setup.py\n\n```bash\ncd utils/blt\npython setup.py sdist\n```\n\n#### Install via pip\n\n```bash\ncd utils/blt/dist\npip install blt-VERSION.tar.gz\n```\n\n## More to come!\n\nMore documentaion/examples to come down the road!", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/dencold/blt/", "keywords": null, "license": "BSD", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "blt", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/blt/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/blt/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/dencold/blt/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/blt/0.2.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "blt - provides simple CLI superpowers.", "version": "0.2.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p># blt: provides simple CLI superpowers</p>\n<p><strong>blt</strong> is a python package that aims to make it easier for application\ndevelopers to wrap command line interfaces for the various tools they use day\nto day. blt was inspired by Heroku\u2019s toolbelt, fabric, and clint.

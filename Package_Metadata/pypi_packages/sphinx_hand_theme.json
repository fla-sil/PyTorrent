For example:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    html_theme_options = {\n        'collapse_navigation': False,\n        'display_version': False,\n        'navigation_depth': 3,\n    }\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n* ``canonical_url`` This will specify a `canonical url <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element>`__\n  to let search engines know they should give higher ranking to latest version of the docs.\n  The url points to the root of the documentation and requires a trailing slash.\n\nPage-level configuration\n------------------------\n\nPages support metadata that changes how the theme renders.\nYou can currently add the following:\n\n* ``:github_url:`` This will force the \"Edit on GitHub\" to the configured URL\n* ``:bitbucket_url:`` This will force the \"Edit on Bitbucket\" to the configured URL\n* ``:gitlab_url:`` This will force the \"Edit on GitLab\" to the configured URL\n\nHow the Table of Contents builds\n================================\n\nCurrently the left menu will build based upon any ``toctree(s)`` defined in your index.rst file.\nIt outputs 2 levels of depth, which should give your visitors a high level of access to your\ndocs. If no toctrees are set the theme reverts to sphinx's usual local toctree.\n\nIt's important to note that if you don't follow the same styling for your rST headers across\nyour documents, the toctree will misbuild, and the resulting menu might not show the correct\ndepth when it renders.\n\nAlso note that the table of contents is set with ``includehidden=true``. This allows you\nto set a hidden toc in your index file with the hidden_ property that will allow you\nto build a toc without it rendering in your index.\n\nBy default, the navigation will \"stick\" to the screen as you scroll. However if your toc\nis vertically too large, it will revert to static positioning. To disable the sticky nav\naltogether change the setting in ``conf.py``.\n\nContributing or modifying the theme\n===================================\n\nThe sphinx_hand_theme is primarily a sass_ project that requires a few other sass libraries. I'm\nusing bower_ to manage these dependencies and sass_ to build the css. The good news is\nI have a very nice set of grunt_ operations that will not only load these dependencies, but watch\nfor changes, rebuild the sphinx demo docs and build a distributable version of the theme.\nThe bad news is this means you'll need to set up your environment similar to that\nof a front-end developer (vs. that of a python developer). That means installing node and ruby.\n\nSet up your environment\n-----------------------\n\n1. Install sphinx_ into a virtual environment.\n\n.. code::\n\n    pip install sphinx\n\n2. Install sass\n\n.. code::\n\n    gem install sass\n\n2. Install node, bower and grunt.\n\n.. code::\n\n    // Install node\n    brew install node\n\n    // Install bower and grunt\n    npm install -g bower grunt-cli\n\n    // Now that everything is installed, let's install the theme dependecies.\n    npm install\n\nNow that our environment is set up, make sure you're in your virtual environment, go to\nthis repository in your terminal and run grunt:\n\n.. code::\n\n    grunt\n\nThis default task will do the following **very cool things that make it worth the trouble**.\n\n1. It'll install and update any bower dependencies.\n2. It'll run sphinx and build new docs.\n3. It'll watch for changes to the sass files and build css from the changes.\n4. It'll rebuild the sphinx docs anytime it notices a change to .rst, .html, .js\n   or .css files.\n\nBefore you create an issue\n--------------------------\n\nI don't have a lot of time to maintain this project due to other responsibilities.\nI know there are a lot of Python engineers out there that can't code sass / css and\nare unable to submit pull requests. That said, submitting random style bugs without\nat least providing sample documentation that replicates your problem is a good\nway for me to ignore your request. RST unfortunately can spit out a lot of things\nin a lot of ways. I don't have time to research your problem for you, but I do\nhave time to fix the actual styling issue if you can replicate the problem for me.\n\nTODO\n====\n\n* Separate some sass variables at the theme level so you can overwrite some basic colors.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/tddv/sphinx_hand_theme/", "keywords": null, "license": "MIT", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "sphinx_hand_theme", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/sphinx_hand_theme/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/sphinx_hand_theme/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/tddv/sphinx_hand_theme/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/sphinx_hand_theme/1.0.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Read the Docs theme for hand", "version": "1.0.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            .. _readthedocs.org: http://www.readthedocs.org<br>.. _bower: http://www.bower.io<br>.. _sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org<br>.. _compass: http://www.compass-style.org<br>.. _sass: http://www.sass-lang.com<br>.. _wyrm: http://www.github.com/snide/wyrm/<br>.. _grunt: http://www.gruntjs.com<br>.. _node: http://www.nodejs.com<br>.. _demo: http://docs.readthedocs.org<br>.. _hidden: http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/toctree.html<br><br>**************************<br>Read the Docs Sphinx HAND Theme<br>**************************<br><br>.. contents:: <br><br>View a working demo_ over on readthedocs.org_.<br><br>This is a mobile-friendly sphinx_ theme I made for readthedocs.org_.<br><br>If you'd like to update the theme,<br>please make your edits to the SASS files here,<br>rather than the .css files on checked into the repo.<br><br>.. image:: screen_mobile.png<br>    :width: 100%<br><br>Installation<br>============<br><br>Via package<br>-----------<br><br>Download the package or add it to your ``requirements.txt`` file:<br><br>.. code:: bash<br><br>    $ pip install sphinx_hand_theme<br><br>In your ``conf.py`` file:<br><br>.. code:: python<br><br>    import sphinx_hand_theme<br><br>    html_theme = \"sphinx_hand_theme\"<br><br>    html_theme_path = [sphinx_hand_theme.get_html_theme_path()]<br><br>Via git or download<br>-------------------<br><br>Symlink or subtree the ``sphinx_hand_theme/sphinx_hand_theme`` repository into your documentation at<br>``docs/_themes/sphinx_hand_theme`` then add the following two settings to your Sphinx<br>conf.py file:<br><br>.. code:: python<br><br>    html_theme = \"sphinx_hand_theme\"<br>    html_theme_path = [\"_themes\", ]<br><br>Configuration<br>=============<br><br>You can configure different parts of the theme.<br><br>Project-wide configuration<br>--------------------------<br><br>The theme's project-wide options are defined in the ``sphinx_hand_theme/theme.conf``<br>file of this repository, and can be defined in your project's ``conf.py`` via<br>``html_theme_options``.

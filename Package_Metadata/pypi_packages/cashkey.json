To perform any operation, you'll have to enter your previously registred password. Otherwise, any operation is impossible.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIt's as simple as:\n```bash\n$ pip install cashkey\n```\n\nUsage\n------------\n\n**Important:** **cashkey** isn't as secured as a REAL hardware wallet, so don't use it as your main way to store your Bitcoins!\n\nBefore you start using **cashkey**, you have to format a USB flash drive to any format you want (preferably FAT32 for portability) and rename the key to `BCH` on formating.\n\nOnce done, go to your command line and run:\n```bash\n$ cashkey\n```\nYou will then be invited to create a new password for your wallet. Choose a strong password and remember everyone with access to your USB wallet, your password and **cashkey** has access to your Bitcoins.\n\nAfter creating a password, you'll be asked to re-run the program. Then to enter your password again. When done, you will have access to a prompt with the following options:\n\n```\n1 \u2013 Print your Bitcoin cash address\n2 \u2013 Get your wallet balance in a given currency\n3 \u2013 Get your transaction history\n4 \u2013 Make a transaction\n5 \u2013 Get transaction fees in satoshis per byte\n6 \u2013 Create a new wallet\n0 \u2013 Exit\n```\nYou can then select an options by entering the **corresponding number** followed by **return**.\n\nAbout\n------------\nMy vision is to create a simple way for people who cannot afford a hardware wallet such as the [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or the [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) to carry their cryptocurrencies in a secure way.\nThe long-term goal is to establish a universal protocol or convention to create a hardware wallet and access it with any software. Monopoly isn't something we should support in the crypto space, instead we should focus on making things simpler and open for everyone.\n\nBased on community needs and demands, I will keep improving the project and adding new functionalities.

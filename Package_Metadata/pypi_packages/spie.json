The SPI estimated by Olshen's method are centered around their respective mean values and have width proportional to their respective sample standard deviations. Bootstrapping is used to determine the constant of proportionality.\n\n* ### Two-Sided Olshen's Method\n#### Two-sided Olshen's method is comparably accurate to Olshen's method and typically produces SPI that are at least as tight as those produced by Olshen's method.\nTwo-sided Olshen's method is a small modification to Olshen's method that was introduced in the paper *Simultaneous Prediction Intervals for Patient-Specific Survival Curves*. At a high level, two-sided Olshen's method differs from Olshen's method in that it is not constrained to symmetric intervals.\n\n* ### Greedy Simultaneous Prediction Interval Estimator (GSPIE)\n#### GSPIE is generally less accurate than Olshen's method but achieves comparable accuracy in some cases. On certain distributions GSPIE produces tighter SPI than other methods.\nGSPIE was also introduced in the paper *Simultaneous Prediction Intervals for Patient-Specific Survival Curves*. GSPIE differs significantly from Olshen's methods in that it works by doing direct optimization over the landscape of simultaneous intervals. It begins with intervals containing all observations and decreases their widths in a greedy manner, using a validation set as a stopping condition. GSPIE requires more computation than Olshen's methods and relies on an intelligent choice of validation split.\n\n* ### Pointwise Bonferroni\n#### Given enough samples such that the quantiles of the ogive do not severely overfit as pointwise intervals, Bonferroni will produce conservative SPI that are generally (though not always) looser than the other methods.\nPointwise Bonferroni is a baseline that estimates pointwise prediction intervals by the quantiles of the ogive (the empirical distribution with linear interpolation) with a Bonferroni correction. The Bonferroni correction is a method that combines pointwise intervals into simultaneous intervals in a manner that is guaranteed to be accurate or conservative. In practice, it often yields simultaneous intervals that are very conservative.\n\n## Relevant References\n\n```\nPrediction Intervals:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_interval\n\n\nOlshen's method:\n\n@article{olshen1989,\n    author = {Olshen, Richard A. and Biden, Edmund N. and Wyatt, Marilynn P. and Sutherland, David H.},\n    doi = {10.1214/aos/1176347372},\n    fjournal = {The Annals of Statistics},\n    journal = {Ann.

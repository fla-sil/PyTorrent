This is because these modifiers rely\n  on modifying attributes of the given shape in place, such as by inserting\n  new entries in the .faces collection. However, MultiShapes provide many of\n  these attributes by using generators to form a composite stream of their\n  children. I guess I ought to make all shape modifiers functional.\n- The supplied 'directional lighting' shader is broken - rotating an object\n  does not modify the apparent illumination of its surfaces.\n- No attempt is made to handle textures. All faces are plain colors.\n- We don't currently handle multiple shaders within a single scene.\n\n\nThanks\n------\n\n`PyWeek <http://pyweek.org>`_ participants 'Scav' and 'Threads' for showing me\nhow it should be done, and PyWeek message board users donal.h, Cosmologicon,\nRB[0], PyTM30, Tee and saluk for cajoling me into accepting the merit of\nallowing people to bring pre-existing codebases into PyWeek so long as they\nare public.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://bitbucket.org/tartley/gloopy", "keywords": "", "license": "New BSD", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "gloopy", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gloopy/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gloopy/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://bitbucket.org/tartley/gloopy"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gloopy/0.1.3a/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Gloopy is a Python library for creating 3D polyhedra and rendering them using\nOpenGL.

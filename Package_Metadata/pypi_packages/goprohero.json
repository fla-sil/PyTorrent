OpenCV (if\ninstalled) is used to open the live stream and save a single frame.\n\nThe command line interface utilizes the\n`wireless <https://github.com/joshvillbrandt/wireless>`__ library to\ncontrol one or more cameras from a single command.\n\nFor more advanced management of multiple cameras, check out the\n`GoProController <https://github.com/joshvillbrandt/GoProController>`__\nand\n`GoProControllerUI <https://github.com/joshvillbrandt/GoProControllerUI>`__\npackages which allow for command queuing and status history as well as\nan interface to view the live stream image captures.\n\nRequirements:\n\n-  GoPro HERO3, GoPro HERO3+, or GoPro HERO4\n-  A computer with a wireless card\n-  (optional) OpenCV\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nDocumentation is available on\n`readthedocs.org <http://goprohero.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__.\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/joshvillbrandt/goprohero.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/joshvillbrandt/goprohero\n.. |Documentation Status| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/goprohero/badge/?version=latest\n   :target: http://goprohero.readthedocs.org/en/latest/", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/joshvillbrandt/gopro", "keywords": null, "license": "Apache License\nVersion 2.0, January 2004\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n1.

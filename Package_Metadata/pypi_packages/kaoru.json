Strict mode has been enforced!\n    (!) You will need to register my commands with my @BotFather\n    (!) Ask him to /setcommands and after you\n    (!) have mentioned me, you can paste the following:\n    ---\n    about - Information for nerds\n    start - Start me up\n    hello - See if I \"live\"\n    help - Get list of available commands\n    screenlock - See if I \"live\"\n    screenshot - Get a screen shot from your host(s)\n    dryrun - Toggle \"dry run\" mode\n    cancel - Cancel any pending operation(s)\n    reboot - Reboot your host(s)\n    poweroff - Shut down your host(s)\n    suspend - Suspend your host(s) to RAM\n    hibernate - Suspend your host(s) to disk\n    ---\n    --- Waiting for updates ...\n\n**NOTE**: bear in mind that **you have to register kaoru's commands for your bot**\nwith the `@BotFather <http://telegram.me/botfather>`_, **kaoru** will tell you how.\n\n**So, I have everything set up. What commands are available on this bot?**\n\nGood question indeed!, the following is the current set of commands\nsupported by **kaoru**, more are planned to come:\n\n\n-  ``/hello`` A simple ping just to see if your bot is *alive*\n-  ``/help`` How to use **kaoru**\n-  ``/screenlock`` Lock screens on your host(s)\n-  ``/screenshot`` Get a screen shot from your host(s)\n-  ``/poweroff`` Tell your host(s) to shut down\n-  ``/reboot`` Tell your host(s) to reboot\n-  ``/cancel`` Cancel any pending operations\n-  ``/dryrun`` don't do a thing, but pretend\n-  ``/about`` information, mostly for nerds\n-  ``/suspend`` Suspend your host(s) to RAM\n-  ``/hibernate`` Suspend your host(s) to disk\n\n\nAre there any sort of requirements for kaoru in order to work properly?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes indeed. For the moment, **kaoru** is only working under certain\nconditions. Hosts running **kaoru** must:\n\n\n-  Be Linux-based at least (though conceptually speaking, ``*nix`` should be supported)\n-  Have ``sudo``. Since commands like ``shutdown`` need to be run as ``root``.\n-  Have either `scrot <http://freecode.com/projects/scrot>`_ or `imagemagick <http://imagemagick.org>`_ installed (if you want ``/screenshot`` command to work)\n-  Run kaoru on behalf on an user whose ``sudo`` privileges cover at least the execution of ``shutdown`` with no password requirement.\n-  Have `pm-utils <http://pm-utils.freedesktop.org/wiki/>`_ installed on your system. This is necessary for ``/suspend`` and ``/hibernate`` to work properly.\n\nConfiguration file\n==================\n\n**kaoru** lists all sorts of configuration directives inside a YAML\nconfiguration file. These directives range from essentials like\na Telegram Bot API token to those related with blablabla. Please refer\nto the `example configuration file <https://github.com/axltxl/kaoru/blob/develop/example.conf>`_\nfor more details on how to configure **kaoru**.\n\n.. code-block:: yaml\n\n    ---\n    ############################\n    # Example configuration file\n    ############################\n\n    # Telegram Bot API access token\n    token: 1XXXXXXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n    # shutdown the host 2 minutes after a /poweroff command has been received\n    poweroff_delay: 2\n\n    # command to execute when a /screenlock command has been received\n    screenlock_cmd: xscreensaver\n\n\n**NOTE**: Configuration files can be read by **kaoru** using the ``--config``\nargument, by default, **kaoru** will look up for a configuration file on\n``~/.config/kaoru/kaoru.conf``\n\n\nSecurity\n========\n\nBy default, **kaoru** runs openly, namely, it will listen to *any incoming\nupdates from any user* wanting to communicate with her, while this would allow you\nto quickly see her working, **it is inherently and by all means INSECURE!!!!**\n\nOnce you feel happy with your configuration, it is strongly advised\nthat you **enforce strict mode** on your configuration file, like so:\n\n.. code-block:: yaml\n\n    ---\n    # .. other options are behind\n\n    # enforce strict mode\n    strict: true\n\n    # The following are the users who can talk\n    # to kaoru. Requests coming from users outside\n    # this list are simply IGNORED.\n    masters:\n        - <your Telegram user name>\n        - betty # your friend betty can also talk to kaoru\n\n\nOnce you're done, you can proceed to re-execute **kaoru**.\nWith ``strict`` directive set to ``true``, **kaoru** will only\nlisten and react to commands and messages coming from users set in ``masters``.\n\n\nOptions\n=======\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    kaoru [options]\n\n\n-  ``--version`` show version number and exit\n-  ``-i | --interactive`` enter CLI mode\n-  ``-c FILE | --config FILE`` configuration file to use\n-  ``-h | --help`` show a help message and exit\n-  ``-d | --dry-run`` don't actually do anything\n-  ``L NUM | --log-level NUM`` set logging output level\n-  ``-l FILE | --log-file LOG_FILE`` set log file\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nThere are many ways in which you can contribute to kaoru.\nCode patches are just one thing amongst others that you can submit to help the project.\nWe also welcome feedback, bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements,\nadvertisement and testing.\n\nFeedback contributions\n----------------------\n\nThis is by far the easiest way to contribute something.\nIf you\u2019re using kaoru for your own benefit, don\u2019t hesitate sharing.\nFeel free to `submit issues and enhancement requests.

Add \"dbaccounting\" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::\n\n\tINSTALLED_APPS  [\n\t\t...\n\t\t'dbaccounting',\n\t]\n\n2. Include the dbaccounting URLconf in your project urls.py like this::\n\n\tpath('fin/',include('dbaccounting.urls')),\n\n3. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the dbaccounting models.\n\n4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin\n   to create Account Types and Accounts (you'll need the Admin app enabled).\n\n5.

Silva allows users to enter\nnew documents as well as edit existing documents using a web\ninterface.\n\nSilva stores the content in a structured format, and keeps a strict\nseparation between the way the content is used and the way it is\npresented. This leads to several important advantages:\n\n* The same content can be used in different media, such as the web,\n  paper, or word processor content. Web publication of content is\n  native to Silva as it is based on Zope, but Silva also has export\n  filters to various formats.\n\n* The content is future proofed and not out of date as soon as you\n  want to use a new system or present it in a different way.\n\n* The structuring of the content facilitates more sophisticated\n  searching and indexing.\n\nSilva supports (but does not require) a separation between authors who\ncan create new content and editors who can approve whether content\nactually gets published. It also allows delegation of editing or\nauthoring responsibilities of a section of the publication to\nothers. Thus, users can be empowered (avoiding a single-person\nbottleneck), without the loss of editorial control.\n\nTo assist in the publication process, Silva implements workflow where\nmultiple versions of the same document are kept around at the same\ntime. One version of a particular document may be published while\nanother version can be edited at the same time.\n\nSilva is extensible with new document types and other types of content\nobjects, others skins ...\n\nFor more information please consult the site: http://silvacms.org\n\nCode repository\n===============\n\nYou can find the code of this extension in Git:\nhttps://github.com/silvacms/Products.Silva\n\n.. _Silva: http://silvacms.org\n\nChanges\n=======\n\nSilva 3.0.4 (2013/12/23)\n------------------------\n\n- Add a site-level quota feature. On the welcome form you get at the\n  Zope root, you can configure a site-level quota for a given\n  site. This quota cannot be changed from within the site.\n\n- Various services are now configurable in SMI under Site preferences.\n\n- Silva Ghost Asset have been added. They are ghost content for\n  assets. When ghosting a Folder, Silva Ghost Asset will be created\n  for each corresponding asset, instead of copying them over. The\n  ghost code have been reviewed a cleaned a bit.\n\nSilva 3.0.3 (2013/10/09)\n------------------------\n\n- Fix various bugs:\n\n  - Regarding broken links and broken ghost.\n\n  - Allow empty string as resize specifier for images.\n\n- Refactor icon support to support different icons for different file\n  mimetypes.\n\n- Refactor and optimize how the last modification date and last author\n  is set. It is now set on contents at the end of the request, just\n  before the content is being re-index. This feature is disabled\n  during upgrade (the last modification date and author are not set on\n  content during upgrades).\n\n\nSilva 3.0.2 (2013/05/24)\n------------------------\n\n- Fix various bugs:\n\n  - You can no longer create a folder called index,\n\n  - You can synchronise a copy of an outdated ghost folder,\n\n  - Keep expiration date of a version if you make a new copy of it and\n    the date is in the future.\n\n- Add support for customizing HTTP headers on most of the default\n  Silva contents.\n\n- Rename metadata sets.\n\n- Add a method to repair the order of the ordered container.\n\n- Improve tests.\n\nSilva 3.0.1 (2013/03/06)\n------------------------\n\n- Update Silva XML import and export feature to a new API that\n  tolerate and report problems during the import. Performances of the\n  export and import have been improved in order to consume less\n  memory, to allow larger exports and imports.\n\n- Fix various bugs when an Image doesn't have any payload (meaning the\n  image is missing).\n\n- Add a name chooser for Zope contents, that is used by the Silva Root\n  add form.\n\n- Support symbolic links for extensions (meaning the path Zope see is\n  a symbolic link to a real extension).\n\n- Silva Containers (Folder, Publications...) now provides a\n  ``fulltext`` method.\n\nSilva 3.0 (2012/12/12)\n----------------------\n\n- Fix various issues (email notifications, indexer, image preview).\n\n- Add a pluggable API to choose and validation content identifiers.\n\n- Add contextual help.\n\n- Update user documentation.\n\n- Improve tests.\n\nSilva 3.0c1 (2012/09/25)\n------------------------\n\n- Split apart some more code in other packages. Reformat some API to\n  follow pep8.\n\n- Use ``grokcore.chameleon``.\n\n- Usuability fixes.\n\n- Add support for a ``VersionedObject`` (and\n  ``VersionedNonPublishable``).\n\n- Improve test coverage.\n\n- Fix various bugs from the beta.\n\nSilva 3.0b1 (2011/11/11)\n------------------------\n\n- Base the SMI on top of ``silva.ui``. Most of screens are implemented\n  in ``silva.core.smi`` and no longer here.\n\n- Major cleanup of the APIs, all methods used by the old SMI have been\n  removed. When need, adapters provides the functionality now.\n\n- Silva root creation process have been reviewed, as a suite of\n  events. This makes possible to have extension that plugs actions at\n  that moment. There is no longer a large install method.\n\n- Built-in Kupu support have been removed.\n\n- XSLT support have been removed, and the renderer registry.\n\n- SilvaViews, FileSystemSite are no longer used and supported.\n\n- Old unused fake adapters have been removed.\n\n- ``view`` and ``preview`` methods on SilvaObject have been\n  removed. It is now the job of the layout system to render them.\n\n- Update code for Zope 2.13 and Python 2.7.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/silvacms/Products.Silva", "keywords": "silva cms zope", "license": "BSD", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "Products.Silva", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Products.Silva/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Products.Silva/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/silvacms/Products.Silva"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Products.Silva/3.0.4/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Silva Content Management System", "version": "3.0.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p><a href=\"http://silvacms.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silva</a> is a Zope-based web application designed for the creation and\nmanagement of structured, textual content.

I realize this is not what everyone needs. But I use this workflow in a lot of my projects, hence, opinionated.\n- Uses ``yield`` to return a generator to fetch large amount of data from a DB without loading everything into the memory.\n- Logs last executed query and time for query execution with a unique ID so queries can be traced in log messages.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    pip install rapyd_db\n\nMake sure you are also installing the appropriate drivers for your respective backend as mentioned above.\n\nOr you can install with driver like this:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    pip install rapyd_db[mysql]\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    # import this\n    from rapyd_db.backends.mysql import MySQL\n\n    # create the DB object; no connection is done at this point\n    # any argument accepted by the underlying DB driver can be passed\n    db = MySQL(host='', user='', passwd='', db='')\n\n    # run queries like so\n\n    # select large data\n    rows = db.execute(\"SELECT * FROM blah\")\n    for row in rows:\n        print(row)\n\n    # insert data\n    db.execute(\n        'INSERT INTO blah(key) VALUE (%s)',\n        ('value1', )\n    )\n\n\nThis is an excerpt of the log messages using ``basicConfig``.

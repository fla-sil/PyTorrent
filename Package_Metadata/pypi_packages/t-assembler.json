Quantum instruction set is a number of instructions that are defined at the assembly level and can be executed on a quantum control microarchitecture. The quantum instruction set should be able to support comprehensive quantum program flow control. \n        \n        Therefore, our instruction set can be divided into two main parts:\n        \n        ### Quantum Instructions\n        The target of quantum instructions is simple: to apply quantum operations on corresponding qubits/edges. Before discussing a quantum bundle containing quantum operations, it is necessary to first explain several mechanisms for increasing the quantum operation issue rate.\n        \n        - Single-operation-multiple-qubit(SOMQ). There are two Target Specify instructions introduced in eQASM: SMIS (mask for single-qubit gate) and SMIT (set mask for two-qubit gate). A mask is firstly stored in a register and then read out by the quantum operation instruction. There are two register files used to store the masks for single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates, which are labeled with \"S\" and \"T\", separately. Therefore, eQASM supports applying a single quantum operation on multiple qubits.\n        \n        - Very-Long-Instruction-Word (VLIW). This architecture can combine different quantum operations into a quantum bundle, e.g., two minor-instructions can be encoded in a single binary instruction. Accordingly, there should be two execution units in the microarchitecture to support this mechanism.\n        \n        - Some quantum experiments require quantum operations to be triggered at deterministic timing, so we use wait instructions to set the timing points.\n        \n        ### Classical Instructions\n        Besides quantum instructions, some simple classical instructions are also necessary for quantum control. In my proposition, these instructions can be included to perform logical and arithmetic operations as well as data transfer.\n        \n        ## Other features\n        One of the main features of is its flexibility of the instruction set.\n        The classic instructions are fixed in name, functionality, and syntax, but the quantum instructions can benefit from more flexibility: the number of instructions and their opcodes can be *configured*, not only at build time,\n        but at *runtime* as well.\n        \n        \nKeywords: hello world example examples\nPlatform: UNKNOWN\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://example.com/HelloWorld/", "keywords": "", "license": "Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004 http://www.apache.org/licenses/", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "t-assembler", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/t-assembler/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/t-assembler/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://example.com/HelloWorld/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/t-assembler/0.5.dev0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Assembler for decoding binary instructions from source code in Quantum Instruction Set,which is used in Tencent Q Lab", "version": "0.5.dev0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION<br><br>   1.

Therefore, eQASM supports applying a single quantum operation on multiple qubits.<br>        <br>        - Very-Long-Instruction-Word (VLIW). This architecture can combine different quantum operations into a quantum bundle, e.g., two minor-instructions can be encoded in a single binary instruction. Accordingly, there should be two execution units in the microarchitecture to support this mechanism.<br>        <br>        - Some quantum experiments require quantum operations to be triggered at deterministic timing, so we use wait instructions to set the timing points.<br>        <br>        ### Classical Instructions<br>        Besides quantum instructions, some simple classical instructions are also necessary for quantum control. In my proposition, these instructions can be included to perform logical and arithmetic operations as well as data transfer.<br>        <br>        ## Other features<br>        One of the main features of is its flexibility of the instruction set.<br>        The classic instructions are fixed in name, functionality, and syntax, but the quantum instructions can benefit from more flexibility: the number of instructions and their opcodes can be *configured*, not only at build time,<br>        but at *runtime* as well.<br>        <br>        <br>Keywords: hello world example

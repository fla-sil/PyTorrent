It does not require any dependencies.\n- `v0.2` is a complete rewrite from scratch. It now allows the use of Groups, uses websockets (autobahn+twisted).\n- `v0.3` is based on `v0.2`. The most important new feature is the ability to reserve groups.\n- `v0.4` is a complete rewrite from scratch. It offers nearly the same functionality as `v0.3`, but no interactie commandloop.

First, an object of the main class System() has to be created.\nThen, components, subsystems, couplings and excitations can be added to the System() instance.\nFinally, when all properties have been set, the modal energies can be solved by executing the solveSystem() method of the System() instance.\n\n\n\n# Prerequisites\n\nRequired are:\n\n- Python 3.4 or higher\n- NumPy\n- matplotlib\n\n\n# Installing\n\nVia pip:\n\n    pip install seapy\n\nVia conda:\n\n    conda install -c ...\n    \nOr clone this repository:\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation can be viewed at [Python Hosted(https://pythonhosted.org/seapy/) and also [here](http://www.fridh.nl/seapy/).\n\n## Reporting bugs", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": "https://pythonhosted.org/seapy/", "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "UNKNOWN", "keywords": null, "license": "LICENSE.txt", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "seapy", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/seapy/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/seapy/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "UNKNOWN"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/seapy/0.1.0.dev-63e51ed/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Statistical Energy Analysis module for Python.", "version": "0.1.0.dev-63e51ed", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p># Introduction</p>\n<p>SeaPy is a Python module to assist in performing a Statistical Energy Analysis, or SEA.\nSEA is used within vibroacoustics to model the flow of acoustic power through a vibrating system.\nAn example is modeling the vibrations in cars due to the engine.\nSEA is generally used in the high-frequency region whereas finite-element analysis is used in the low-frequency region.</p>\n<p>First step in performing an SEA is creating the geometry.\nThen, the relevant components are modeled as subsystems, where each subsystem represents one wave type.\nThe subsystems are then connected through couplings.\nPower is added into the system through excitation of one or more subsystems.\nPower dissipation in subsystems and couplings are modeled using loss factors.\nFinally, a single matrix composed of loss factors, modal densities and input powers, are solved resulting in the modal energies of each subsystem, from which their vibration or noise levels can be calculated.</p>\n<p># SeaPy</p>\n<p>This module provides several classes and functions to perform an SEA.

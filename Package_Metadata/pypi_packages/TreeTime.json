A tree is a hierarchical structure that arranges your data into units and sub-units. Mathematical functions (sum, difference, mean, ratio) can be calculated recursively. Linked trees are distinct trees that share data between them. In _TreeTime_, a data object is part of several trees at the same time. _TreeTime_ is a time planner, a to-do list manager, a test report tool, a project planner, a family ancestry editor, a mind-mapping tool, and similar.\n\n<div id='id-contents'/>\n\n### Table of Contents  ###\n\n- [Concept](#id-concept)\n- [Basic Use](#id-usage)\n- [Data Files](#id-file-syntax)\n- [Installation](#id-installation)\n- [Road-Map](#id-roadmap)\n- [Dependencies](#id-dependencies)\n\n\n<div id='id-concept'/>\n\n## Concept ##\n[Table of Contents](#id-contents)\n\n### What is a Tree? ###\n\nA \"tree\" is a data structure, much like a table or a list. Using a tree you can naturally package your information into boxes and sub-boxes and sub-sub-boxes. Some examples:\n\nIf you want to organise your work tasks you could sort them into work packages, that are part of projects, that are part of products. Alternatively, if you plan a larger project, you can sort all tasks by responsible persons, who are part of teams, that are part of departments, that are part of branches. You can also make a time plan, where a year consists of quarters, that consist of weeks, that contain a number of tasks. You can have an address book where you have a hierarchy of friends / colleagues / aquaintances, or you can sort knowledge about animals into kingdom / class / family / species.\n\nThe nice thing about trees is that you can define mathematical functions on them. Planned hours can be summed up per work package and project, or per person and team, or per week and month. A mean priority can be shown per work package and project.\n\nThe concept of hierarchical categorisation can be applied to all sorts of data and will feel a lot more natural and easier to use than organising the same data in spread sheets.\n\n### What are linked Trees? ### \n\nThe core concept of _TreeTime_ are linked trees. Linked trees are separate trees that share the same data. One piece of data (a _node_) can be in several trees at the same time, but in different place of the tree. A tree is much like a way of sorting, and linked trees sort the same data in different ways.\n![Screenshot 1](doc/linked-trees.png)\nNode _E_ is right at the bottom of _Tree 1_, as a child of _A_ and _B_, and in _Tree 2_ it is a child of _C_. Node _D_ is a child of _A_ and _B_ in _Tree 1_, and a child of _C_ and _B_ in _Tree 2_.\n\nIf you, for instance, organise information about animals, you might want to see the animal's taxonomy (kingdom/class/family/species), but also their habitat (continent/country/area), and switch between both views. If you organise tasks, you could switch between a year/quarter/week/day breakdown, a company/department/team/person tree, and a product/project/package/task overview.\n\nIn _TreeTime_, the structure of your data (whether you store priority, hours, and a description for a task, or expected life span, habitat and number of legs for an animal), the trees themselves, and the calculated values within the trees are completely user defined. Data is stored in text files, changes are saved on the fly, and when opening _TreeTime_, the software is automatically connected to the last used file.\n\n<div id='id-usage'/>\n\n##  Basic Use  ##\n[Table of Contents](#id-contents)\n\nStart the software (see 'Execute' from the section [Installation](#id-installation)). In the main dialog, go to \"File\" / \"New from Template\", select \"Simple-Task-List.trt\" and in the next dialog give a file name for the new file. An example file with a simple project task list structure will open.\nThe GUI consists of three parts:\n- A button box on the left. Execute tree structure operations from here.\n- An editing grid in the middle, showing the contents of the selected data item. Edit single data items here.\n- A tab view with tress spanning the center-right. View and analyse your data here.\n\n![Screenshot 1](doc/screenshot01.png)\nAccess each single tree by clicking a tab on the main tree-view widget (the picture above shows the tree _Time Plan_, the picture below the tree _Projects_).\n![Screenshot 2](doc/screenshot02.png)\nBranches and children can be sorted, branches can be folded and unfolded. Data content is shown via analytic fields that are defined per tree. In the example project you will see a sum, a percentage, and text display.\n\nAdd, move and remove single nodes and complete branches by using the buttons on the left. Change the name of a node by selecting the node and editing the name in the top of the edit grid in the middle. Change all other values (numbers or text) by clicking into the field and start typing.\n\nThe parents of an item are listed underneath the item name. Each tree has a separate line. Change the position of a node within a tree by clicking on any of the parent buttons.\n![Screenshot 2](doc/screenshot03.png)\nIn this example a new node in the tree _Time Plan_ has just been created, and is now added to the tree _Projects_.\n\n_TreeTime_ lets you select different themes and will try to use the default colours that are defined with your operating\nsystem.\n\n![Screenshot 2](doc/screenshot04.png)\n\n<dif id='id-file-syntax'/>\n\n## Data Files ##\n\n_TreeTime_'s data is stored in ._trt_ files. These are plain editable text files. Please have a look at the file _Simple-Task-List.trt_ to understand the syntax. A detailed description will follow later. (Sorry...)\n\n<div id='id-installation'/>\n\n##  Installation  ##\n[Table of Contents](#id-installation)\n\n### Using pre-compiled Binaries ###\n\n- Windows, Linux: Go to [github.com/jkanev/treetime/releases/tag/2018-10](https://github.com/jkanev/treetime/releases/tag/2018-10) and download a zipped package for Windows 10, 64 bit, or for Linux 64 bit from there. Unzip it into your program directory and run _TreeTime_ or _TreeTime.exe_ from the new folder. Unzip the data package too. Add the program folder to your path.  \n  \n  Executable bundles have been created with pyinstaller ([www.pyinstaller.org](http://www.pyinstaller.org)).\n\n- Mac: Mac users please use the Python code (see below). There is no executable for Mac.\n(If anybody can help building an executable for other platforms I'd be delighted.)\n\n### Using a PyPi package in Python ###\n\n1. If you don't have it yet, install python3\n2. Install PyQt5 -- on an elevated command prompt (Windows), or on the standard command line (Mac, Linux), type:  \n    `pip install pyqt5`\n3. Install _TreeTime_ -- on an elevated command prompt (Windows), or on the standard command line (Mac, Linux), type:\n    `pip install treetime`\n\n### Using script code with Python ###\n\n1. If you don't have it yet, install python3\n2. Install PyQt5 -- on an elevated command prompt (Windows), or on the standard command line (Mac, Linux), type: `pip install pyqt5`\n3. Download this project from GitHub as a zip file (https://github.com/jkanev/treetime/archive/master.zip) and unzip\n4. Install _TreeTime_: in the command line, cd into the main directory, then type:\n   - Linux:  \n       `python3 setup.py build`  \n       `sudo python3 setup.py install`  \n   - Windows:  \n       `py setup.py build`  \n       `py setup.py install`  \n\n### Execute ###\n\n- Windows: Hit the Windows key and type \"TreeTime\", then click the \"run command treetime\" that comes up.\n- Linux, Mac: On the command line, type \"TreeTime\". You can also start this any other way your operating system supports. Plus, there's a .desktop file (for KDE and Gnome) in the data directory to create desktop or menu link.\n\n\n<div id='id-roadmap'/>\n\n##  Road-Map  ##\n[Table of Contents](#id-contents)\n\nI deliberately didn't give any time estimates for this. I'm using the software myself to organise my own data, so I'm interested in keeping this going. Nevertheless I cannot promise any specific release dates. If you have any suggestions or would like me to implement some feature sooner than I suggested here, please just drop me an email.\n\nPast\n- Done February 2016: Implement selection (the same item gets selected in all trees, changing a tab shows the same item)\n- Done March 2016: Implement remaining local functionality (Copy Branch as Sibling, Copy Children to Siblings, Remove from this Tree, Delete Item)\n- Done August 2016: Created installable python package\n- Done May 2017: Implemented new field type _text_\n- Done June 2017: Create deployable packages for Linux and Windows\n- Done June 2017: Made pre-release v0.0 available\n- Done October 2017: Implemented new field type _node-path_, re-wrote the way nodes move to new parents\n- Done November 2017: Uploaded package to pypi.python.org, _TreeTime_ can now be installed using pip\n- Done October 2018: Re-implemented the parent selection mechanism.

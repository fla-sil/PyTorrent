Python Database Interface\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nmxODBC Connect is a client-server product from eGenix that enables\nfast, easy and secure access from any Python application to remote\ndatabases on your network, using the same well-established mxODBC\nPython DB-API 2.0 compatible API, providing access to many\nadvanced database features such as multiple result sets,\nstored procedures and custom row objects.\n\nCross-Platform Database Access without Client-Side Database Drivers\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnlike our mxODBC Python ODBC Interface, mxODBC Connect is designed as\nclient-server application, so you no longer need to find production\nquality ODBC drivers for all the client platforms you target with your\nPython application.\n\nInstead you use an easy to install royalty-free Python client library\nwhich connects directly to the mxODBC Connect database server over the\nnetwork.\n\nThis makes mxODBC Connect the ideal basis for writing cross-platform\nmulti-tier database applications in Python, especially if you develop\napplications that need to communicate with databases such as MS SQL\nServer and MS Access, Oracle Database, IBM DB2 and Informix, Sybase\nASE and Sybase Anywhere, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SAP MaxDB and many more,\nthat run on remote Windows or Linux machines.\n\nCentralized Database Access Administration\n------------------------------------------\n\nBy removing the need to install and configure ODBC drivers on the\nclient side, mxODBC Connect greatly simplifies setup, rollout and\nconfiguration of database driven client applications, while at the\nsame time making the network communication between client and database\nserver more efficient and more secure.\n\nServer Packages\n---------------\n\nThe mxODBC Connect Server packages includes the server application of\nthe eGenix.com mxODBC Connect Database Interface for Python and are\navailable for Linux and Windows as 32- and 64-bit application.\n\nThey are distributed as installers which have to be downloaded from\nour product web page (see below).\n\nClient Package\n--------------\n\nThe mxODBC Connect Client package is distributed as pure Python\npackage and works on most platforms where you can run Python.\n\nThe client package is available from our product page (see below)\nand as \"egenix-mxodbc-connect-client\" package on PyPI:\n\n    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/egenix-mxodbc-connect-client/\n\nDownloads\n---------\n\nFor downloads, documentation, changelog, evaluation and production\nlicenses, please visit the product page at:\n\n    http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBCConnect/\n\nWeb Installer\n-------------\n\nThe source package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) is a web\ninstaller, which will automatically select and download the right\nclient packages for your installation platform.\n\n    pip install egenix-mxodbc-connect-client\n    \nfor added security, also install egenix-pyopenssl:\n    \n    pip install egenix-pyopenssl\n  \n\nLicenses\n--------\n\nFor evaluation and production server licenses, please visit our\nproduct page at:\n\n    http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBCConnect/#Licensing\n\nThe clients can be used free of charge and don't require installation\nof licenses.\n\nThis software is brought to you by eGenix.com and distributed under\nthe eGenix.com Commercial License 1.3.0.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBCConnect/", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBCConnect/", "keywords": null, "license": "eGenix.com Commercial License 1.3.0; Copyright (c) 2008-2015, eGenix.com Software GmbH, All Rights Reserved", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "egenix-mxodbc-connect-server", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/egenix-mxodbc-connect-server/", "platform": "Windows,Linux", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/egenix-mxodbc-connect-server/", "project_urls": {"Download": "http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBCConnect/", "Homepage": "http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBCConnect/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/egenix-mxodbc-connect-server/2.1.5/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "eGenix mxODBC Connect Server", "version": "2.1.5", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"egenix-mxodbc-connect-server-python-database-interface\">\n<h2>eGenix mxODBC Connect Server -

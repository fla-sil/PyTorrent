Install `pywin32 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/>`_ package to your Windows box.\n\n2. Create new presentation(.ppt) and draw shape.\n\n3. Select the shape you wrote and display format tab. Specify shape of name the shape at 'title' field.\n\n4. Save presentation file.\n\n5. In `conf.py` file of your Sphinx project, add following configuration.\n\n   .. code-block:: python\n\n      extensions = ['pptshape.directive']\n\n6. Add following lines in your .rst files.\n\n   ::\n\n      .. ppt-shape:: abc.png\n         :pptfilename: testppt.pptx\n         :shapename: shape-title\n\n\n   `abc.png` is a name of png file to be created. `:pptfilename:` specifies name of PowerPoint presentaion. `:shapename:` specifies name of shape you specified at step 3.\n\n7. Build sphinx project.\n\n\nSpecial shape name\n------------------\n\nShapename in the pptshape directive starts with `#` specifies\nposition in the PowerPoint presentation rather than title of the shape.\n\n1. `#m.n` repesents `n` th shape in the `m` th slide.\n\n2. `#n` represents `n` th shape through entire the ppt presentation.\n\nBoth `n` and `m` should be digit indexes pages and shapes from 1 and up.\nFor example, `#1` is for first shape of the document,\nand `#2.1` is for first shape in the second slide.\n\nThis way is usefull for the document which cannot be modified to add\nshape title, or for old power point (2007 or before) which does not\nsupport shape title.\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n* Python 2.7/3.3 or later\n\n* pywin32 to generate png file.\n\nCopyright \n=========================\n\nCopyright (c) 2013, 2014 Atsuo Ishimoto\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

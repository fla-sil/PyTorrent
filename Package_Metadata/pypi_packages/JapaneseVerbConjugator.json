Depending on the conjugation and [verb class](https://wtawa.people.amherst.edu/jvrules/index.php?form=groups), the parameters for conjugation methods may vary. \n\n**Example**\n\n`generate_plain_form` requires `verb class`, `tense`, and `formality` parameters.\n\n`generate_volitional_form` requires `verb class`, `tense`, and `polarity` parameters.\n\n## Installation\n\nUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install `japaneseverbconjugator`. If you want to install `japaneseverbconjugator` and its dependencies in a virtual environment, first create and activiate a virtual environment. If you want to change the virtual environment name to someting other than `venv`, replace the second `venv` with your desired name. Use that same name to replace `venv` in the second command.\n\n```python\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nIf you run into trouble, see the [Python Virtual Environment tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). \n\n### Method 1: Pip\nAfter installing and activating the virtual environment, run the following commands to install `japaneseverbconjugator` and its dependencies.\n\n```bash\npip install japaneseverbconjugator\n```\n#### Note\nPip may display an error during installation that includes the following message. \n\n```\nNo matching distribution found for romkan (from JapaneseVerbConjugator)\n```\n\nIn this case, run the command `pip install romkan` and then run `pip install japaneseverbconjugator` again.\n\nYou should be good to go! See the **Usage** section on how to get started using the library.\n\n### Method 2: Clone this repository\n\nGo to the directory you want to clone this repository and run the following command.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/jShiohaha/JapaneseVerbConjugator.git\n```\n\nAfter installing the library, install the library dependencies via pip with the following command. The dependencies in `requirements.txt` will allow you to run the library and tests.\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nYou should be good to go! See the **Usage** section on how to get started using the library.\n\n## Usage\n\nHere is an example of how to import the library and use it.\n\n```python\nfrom japaneseverbconjugator.src import JapaneseVerbFormGenerator as japaneseVerbFormGenerator\nfrom japaneseverbconjugator.src.constants.EnumeratedTypes import VerbClass, Tense, Polarity\n\njvfg = japaneseVerbFormGenerator.JapaneseVerbFormGenerator() # creates JapaneseVerbFormGenerator instance\njvfg.generate_plain_form(\"\u98f2\u3080\", VerbClass.GODAN, Tense.NONPAST, Polarity.POSTIIVE) # returns '\u98f2\u3080'\njvfg.generate_plain_form(\"\u98f2\u3080\", VerbClass.GODAN, Tense.NONPAST, Polarity.NEGATIVE) # returns '\u98f2\u307e\u306a\u3044'\n```\n\nThe library will try to help validate the correctness of the verb by checking for invalid verb lengths, non-Japanese characters, and invalid verb endings. **Limitation**: this library cannot identify Chinese words with valid Japanese particle endings or nonexistent Japanese verbs.\n\n## Tests\n\nRunning tests should be done from `japaneseverbsconjugator` directory. Otherwise, you will get errors saying that Python cannot find certain modules needed for import.\n\nThe script named `RunTests.sh` makes it easy to run all the tests for this library. This repository includes the `coverage` package to track code coverage, and `RunTests.sh` will use this package if you instruct it to do so.\n\n#### Run tests and view HTML coverage report\n\nUse the following commands to run the tests and see the HTML coverage report in a browser.\n\n```bash\n./RunTests.sh html\n```\n\n**Note**: If this doesn't work, you can manually create and open the report with the following commands.\n\n```bash\ncoverage html\nopen htmlcov/index.html\n```\n\n#### Run tests and view command line coverage report\n\nUse the following commands to run the tests and see the coverage report on command line.\n\n```bash\n./RunTests.sh report\n```\n\n#### Run tests\n\nUse the following commands to only run the tests with the `unittest` framework.\n\n```bash\n./RunTests.sh\n```\n\n## Contributing\nPull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.\n\nPlease make sure to update tests as appropriate.\n\n## License\nThis project uses a Python package named `romkan`, which has a BSD license.

By default a C source\nand header file are generated for each NJI file (which defines a single\nJava class). The header file gives access to a single extern struct that\nis the C version a Java class, and provides a means of accessing all of\nthe constructors, fields, and methods of the class the were specified in\nthe NJI file. A means to access the jclass, jfieldID's, and jmethodID's\nis also provided.\n\nNJI JSON Fields\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIt's probably easiest to supply a documented example.

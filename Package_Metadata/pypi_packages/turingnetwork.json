We have created a separate FlashLight client for you to import in your script but FlashLight server still have to be with python3.5+, that means, you'll end up installing ``flashlight-client`` in your environment that uses older version of python and you need to create an environement with new version of python for running the FlashLight server. We really wanted to help you and hence we had created docker image also for you.

The client can query the meetup api and get back dictionaries of \"meetup data\". Note that member permissions on Meetup.com apply to the members api queries.\n\nModels made to mimic hypothesized meetup.com database tables can take the client's data and turn them into local database objects.\n\nThe developer can then use the models to post information onto their webpage.\n\nTo contribute\n-------------\n\nIf you have methods or modifications which refine this package please contribute via `github astrodsg/django-meetup <https://github.com/astrodsg/django-meetup.git>`_.\n\nOther resources\n---------------\n\nOther resources to consider for requesting/posting data from Meetup.com\n\n* `python-api-client <https://github.com/meetup/python-api-client>`_..\n\n* `signed requests using javascript <http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/auth/#keysign>`_..\n\n\nNote: In the project I developed this for I decided to go with a smaller app which doesn't store local information is more like the `python-api-client <https://github.com/meetup/python-api-client>`_.. . The project is located at `github.com/SLCPython/slcpy.com <https://github.com/SLCPython/slcpy.com>`_.. if you want to see the actual implementation.

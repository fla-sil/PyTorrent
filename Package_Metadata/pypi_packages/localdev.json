This tool was built to dramatically reduce \n[the pain](http://mikeferrier.com/2011/04/04/setting-up-wildcard-dns-on-localhost-domains-on-osx/) \nof setting up multi-domain local development. It takes the place of a DNS \nserver like Bind or dnsmasq, and a reverse proxy like Apache or Nginx. \n\nWith localdev you can stop fussing with /etc/hosts and configuration files. \nInstead, hook-up your development servers with a single command.\n\n## Use\n\n    sudo localdev --rules \"niftythings.dev=5000, api.niftythings.dev=5001, *.niftythings.dev=5002\"\n\nIn the above example, three servers are running on localhost: a webserver on \nport 5000, an api server on 5001 and a server hosting customer content on port 5002. \nLocaldev routes web requests to the three servers by matching the hostname of \neach request to a rule, and proxying the request to the corresponding port.\n\nBy default requests are routed to localhost. You can also route traffic to a \nserver running elsewhere, such as on your LAN:\n\n    sudo localdev --rules \"*.here.dev=5000, *.there.dev=192.168.1.10:5000\"\n\nSudo is required if you use the default ports 53 and 80 for handling DNS and \nHTTP traffic. To run without sudo, you'd need to provide alternative ports, \nwhich is pretty normal for HTTP, but setting up DNS on a port other than 53 is\npretty weird. See the [reference](#ref) on option -D if this is important.\n\n## Under the hood\n\nLocaldev doesn't touch your system configuration. It's entirely contained \nwithin a single process.\n\nWhen launched, localdev starts two services: a local DNS server that maps a TLD \n(like .dev) to localhost, and a reverse proxy that routes HTTP requests to your \nservers based on the configuration rules.\n\nHere's a little anecdote to clarify the process:\n\n> When you type \"mysite.dev\" into your browser, first your browser issues a \n> DNS query to your primary DNS server. If installed correctly, localdev says \n> \"Yo, that server is on localhost\". Then your browser is like, \"word\" and sends \n> an HTTP request to localhost port 80. Then localdev slides over and says \n> \"Surprise! Me again.\", and proxies the HTTP request to the destination server\n> according to the rules you defined. \"Whatever,\" says your browser.\n\nThe DNS is a lightweight server based on [devdns](https://github.com/colevscode/devdns). \nThe reverse proxy is based on [quickproxy](https://github.com/colevscode/quickproxy), \nwhich is itself built on [Tornado](http://http://www.tornadoweb.org/).\n\n## Installation\n\nFor non python developers, using a mac or linux:\n\n    sudo easy_install localdev\n\nFor python people:\n\n    pip install localdev\n\n### Set localhost as your primary DNS server <a name=\"dnslist\"></a>\n\nIn order for localdev to work, your browser needs to use it for DNS resolution.\nThis requires putting localhost (127.0.0.1) at the top of your system-wide DNS \nserver list. I recommend also adding Google's DNS addresses (8.8.8.8 and \n8.8.4.4) as backup servers (since localdev isn't a general DNS server).\n\nTo do this on a Mac, open System Preferences and open the Network pane. On the \nleft side, select the network adapter you use (most likely your wireless \nadapter), and then click Advanced. Under the DNS tab, click the + button under \nthe DNS Servers list, and add 127.0.0.1, 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 in that order. \nClick OK, then click Apply.\n\n![](http://raw.github.com/colevscode/devdns/master/dnsconfig.png)\n\n## Troubleshooting (Mac)\n\nIf DNS was simple, this tool wouldn't be valuable. Unfortunately that also \nmeans that it's difficult to make a DNS tool that works out of the box for \neveryone. Here are some things you can check if localdev doesn't work on the  \nfirst try:\n\n- Use `dig` to see if localdev correctly resolves your domain name to 127.0.0.1\n      \n\n      dig mycoolsite.dev\n\n\n  You should see something like:\n\n      # dig mysite.dev\n      ; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> mysite.dev\n      ;; global options: +cmd\n      ;; Got answer:\n      ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 55138\n      ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0\n\n      ;; QUESTION SECTION:\n      ;mysite.dev.            IN  A\n\n      ;; ANSWER SECTION:\n      mysite.dev.     60  IN  A   127.0.0.1\n\n      ;; Query time: 31 msec\n      ;; SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1)\n      ;; WHEN: Sun Feb  2 21:44:45 2014\n      ;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 44\n  \n  If there's no ANSWER SECTION, make sure you've correctly configured your \n  [dns server list](#dnslist).\n\n- Use `curl -v mysite.dev` to see if there's an error. Depending on the error, \n  you can try a few things:\n\n  - `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: mysite.dev`\n\n    In this case, try flushing the dns cache and restarting mDNSResponder:\n\n        dnscacheutil -flushcache\n        sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\n    If that doesn't work, unload and reload mDNSResponder:\n\n        sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\n        sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\n\n    More discussion [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/26616/dns-not-resolving-on-mac-os).\n\n  - `curl: (52) Empty reply from server`\n\n    See the discussion below about previous installations below.\n\n- If you previously installed Bind or dnsmasq, you may have to disable those \n  services. \n\n  Unload bind:\n\n      sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.isc.named.plist\n\n  probably something similar for dnsmasq.\n\n- If you're forwarding port 80 to a non restricted port, like 8080, with ipfw \n  or pf, that could also be a problem. Try running localdev using that port:\n\n      localdev -r mysite.dev=5000 -p 8080\n\n  Generally, check your firewall settings to ensure that HTTP traffic can reach \n  localdev.\n\n## Usage Reference <a name=\"ref\"></a>\n\n    usage: localdev [-h] [-f CONFIG] [-r RULES] [-p PORT] [-t TLD] [-i IP]\n                    [-S SSLPORT] [-D DNSPORT] [-v] [-w]\n\n    Turn-key DNS server and proxy for multi-domain development.\n\n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      -f CONFIG, --config CONFIG\n                            The config file where proxy rules are stored.

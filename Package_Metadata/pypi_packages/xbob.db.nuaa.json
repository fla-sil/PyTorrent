What\nyou would do instead is to tie it in at the package you need to **use** it.\nThere are a few ways to achieve this:\n\n1. You can add this package as a requirement at the ``setup.py`` for your own\n   `satellite package\n   <https://github.com/idiap/bob/wiki/Virtual-Work-Environments-with-Buildout>`_\n   or to your Buildout ``.cfg`` file, if you prefer it that way. With this\n   method, this package gets automatically downloaded and installed on your\n   working environment, or\n\n2. You can manually download and install this package using commands like\n   ``easy_install`` or ``pip``.\n\nThe package is available in two different distribution formats:\n\n1. You can download it from `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_, or\n\n2. You can download it in its source form from `its git repository\n   <https://github.com/bioidiap/xbob.db.nuaa>`_. When you download the\n   version at the git repository, you will need to run a command to recreate\n   the backend SQLite file required for its operation. This means that the\n   database raw files must be installed somewhere in this case. With option\n   ``a`` you can run in `dummy` mode and only download the raw data files for\n   the database once you are happy with your setup.\n\nYou can mix and match points 1/2 and a/b above based on your requirements. Here\nare some examples:\n\nModify your setup.py and download from PyPI\n===========================================\n\nThat is the easiest. Edit your ``setup.py`` in your satellite package and add\nthe following entry in the ``install_requires`` section (note: ``...`` means\n`whatever extra stuff you may have in-between`, don't put that on your\nscript)::\n\n    install_requires=[\n      ...\n      \"xbob.db.nuaa\",\n    ],\n\nProceed normally with your ``boostrap/buildout`` steps and you should be all\nset. That means you can now import the namespace ``xbob.db.nuaa`` into your scripts.\n\nModify your buildout.cfg and download from git\n==============================================\n\nYou will need to add a dependence to `mr.developer\n<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.developer/>`_ to be able to install from our\ngit repositories.

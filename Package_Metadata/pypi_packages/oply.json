I have not tried with *PyPy* or any\nother accelerators yet.  Maybe in the future there will be wrappers to\nhigh performance libraries (say, written in C), with the pure Python\nimplementation as a mere fallback.\n\nSaid that, this library was written more out of my own curiosity, and because\nI was lacking a way to render the *IMF* chunks of *Wolfenstein 3D* in my\n`pywolf` project, instead of relying on external binaries, although it takes\nhours to export all of its assets... whatever! xD\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n> oply - Yamaha OPL emulation with Python\n> Copyright (C) 2016 Andrea Zoppi\n>\n> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n> it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n> the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n> (at your option) any later version.\n>\n> This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n> but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n> MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

{"info": {"author": "Ethan Jucovy", "author_email": "ejucovy@gmail.com", "bugtrack_url": null, "classifiers": [], "description": "What is it?\n===========\n\nThe intent of this package is to provide a (mostly) automated setup\nfor running OpenCore on the WSGI-compliant repoze.zope2 stack.\n\nThis is still experimental; OpenCore is **not** guaranteed to run\nsmoothly in this setup. Please report bugs unique to this setup at\n\n http://trac.openplans.org/openplans/newticket?component=repopencore\n\nThis package is intended to be installed into an existing OpenCore\nbuild. It will not build OpenCore itself. Please read\n\n http://www.coactivate.org/projects/opencore/getting-started\n\nfor OpenCore installation instructions.\n\nHow do I use it?\n================\n\n1. Install this package into your OpenCore environment.\n\n2. Generate a configuration file for your deployment:\n\n   `mkopencoreconfig 8080 zope/etc/zope.conf > opencore.ini`\n\n     The first argument is the port to serve from; this\n     does not need to be the same port that you serve\n     your standard OpenCore setup from, and in fact the\n     two setups can theoretically run in parallel.\n\n     The second argument is the (absolute or relative) path\n     to your Zope configuration file, usually found in\n     {build_dir}/opencore/zope/etc/zope.conf\n\n3. Start the server:\n\n   `run-opencore-wsgi zope/bin/zopectl opencore.ini`\n\n     The first argument is the (absolute or relative) path to\n     your `zopectl` executable, usually found in\n     {build_dir}/opencore/zope/bin/zopectl\n\n     The second argument is the path to the configuration file\n     generated by `mkopencoreconfig`.\n\n     Additional arguments like --reload or --daemon can be provided.\n     They will be passed to the `paster serve` command executed\n     here; run `paster serve --help` for available options.\n    \nIf you're ambitious you should be able to hook this into your\nSupervisor setup, buildout configuration, and/or repeatable\nFassembler build. I haven't tried any of these.\n\nWhat else can it do?\n====================\n\nThere is also an experimental configuration for running a single wsgi\nstack with opencore and tasktracker as endpoints, and a Deliverance\nmiddleware set up to theme tasktracker for full visual integration.\n\nIf you want to try this out, the steps are similar:\n\n 1. First, install the extra dependencies with commands provided by\n    repopencore:\n\n    `install-myghty-fork && install-tasktracker && install-deliverance`\n\n    This will install TaskTracker and Deliverance from trunk as well as\n    a version of Myghty (which is required by a dependency of TaskTracker)\n    with the following patch applied to myghty.importer at L56:\n\n     -__builtin__.__import__ = import_module\n     +#__builtin__.__import__ = import_module\n\n    That monkeypatch of the built-in __import__ seems to break Zope's own\n    munging of sys.path which results in ImportErrors all over the place,\n    hence the forked installation here.\n\n 2. Next, generate a configuration file for your deployment:\n\n    `mkopencoreconfig-with-tt 8080 zope/etc/zope.conf ../../../var/secret.txt  ../../../var/admin.txt ./ > opencore-with-tt.ini`\n\n    The first two arguments are the same as `mkopencoreconfig` above.\n    The third and fourth arguments are the paths to your shared secret\n    and admin info files (which are written outside the ./builds directory\n    by Fassembler, since they don't change on every build). The last\n    argument is a base path for TaskTracker to place some of its data\n    including template caches and the SQLite database.\n\n 3. Initialize the TaskTracker database:\n\n    `paster setup-app opencore-with-tt.ini#tasktracker`\n\n 4. Start the server:\n\n   `run-opencore-wsgi zope/bin/zopectl opencore.ini`\n\nCurrently theming (with Deliverance) is not in place, but otherwise the\nintegration will actually Just Work as long as you've configured everything\ncorrectly.\n\nIt should also be possible to use this configuration with a pre-existing\nTaskTracker database; just edit the relevant lines in opencore-with-tt.ini\nto point them to your existing database instead of using a newly created\nSQLite database.\n\nNew in this version\n===================\n\n0.3\n===\n\nTaskTracker is now themed with Deliverance. See README.txt for instructions.\n\nIf you already have an `opencore-with-tt.ini` file generated from repopencore 0.2,\njust add \".deliverance_rule_file = /path/to/repopencore/repopencore/deliverance.xml\"\nto the `[composite:main]` section to upgrade.\n\n0.2\n===\n\nAdded support for TaskTracker in WSGI pipeline.

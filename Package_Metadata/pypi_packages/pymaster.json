The code also implements E/B-mode purification and is available in both full-sky and flat-sky modes.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are different ways to install NaMaster. In rough order of complexity, they are:\n\n### Conda forge \nUnless you care about optimizing the code, it's worth giving this one a go. The conda recipe for NaMaster is currently hosted on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/namaster) (infinite kudos to [Mat Becker](https://github.com/beckermr) for this). In this case, installing NaMaster means simply running:\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge namaster\n```\nIf that works for you and you don't care about optimizing the code too much, skip the rest of this section. If you don't have admin permissions, you can give virtual environments a try (or else follow the instructions below).\n\n### PyPI\nNaMaster is also hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pymaster). Installing it should be as simple as running:\n```\npython -m pip install pymaster [--user]\n```\n(add `--user` if you don't have admin permissions. Note that this will compile the code on your machine, so you'll need to have installed its [dependencies](#dependencies).\n\n### From source\nIf all the above fail, try to install NaMaster from its source. You should first clone this [github repository](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/NaMaster). Then follow these steps:\n\n#### 1. Install dependencies.\nInstall the dependencies listed [here](#dependencies). Note that some of them (libsharp and HEALPix) may not be necessary, as pymaster will attempt to install them automatically.\n\n#### 2. Install the python module\nInstalling the python module `pymaster` should be as simple as running\n```\npython setup.py install [--user]\n```\nor, even better, if you can use `pip`:\n```\npip install . [--user]\n```\nwhere the optional `--user` flag can be used if you don't have admin privileges.\n\nYou can check that the python installation works by running the unit tests:\n```\npython -m unittest discover -v\n```\nNote that the `test` directory, containing all unit tests, also contains all the sample python scripts described in the [documentation](https://namaster.readthedocs.io).\n\nIf you installed `pymaster` via `pip`, you can uninstall everything by running\n```\npip uninstall pymaster\n```\n\n***Note that the C library is automatically compiled when installing the python module.*** If you care about the C library at all, or you have trouble compiling it, see the next section.\n\n### 3. Install the C code (optional)\nThe script `scripts/install_libnmt.sh` contains the instructions run by `setup.py` to compile the C library (`libnmt.a`). You may have to edit this file or make sure to include any missing compilation flags if `setup.py` encounters issues compiling the library.\n\nIf you need the C library for your own code, `scripts/install_libnmt.sh` installs it in `_deps/lib` and `_deps/include`. Note that the script process will also generate an executable `namaster`, residing in `_deps/bin` that can be used to compute power spectra. The use of this program is discouraged over using the python module.\n\nYou can check that the C code works by running\n```\nmake check\n```\nIf all the checks pass, you're good to go.\n\n\n## Documentation \nThe following sources of documentation are available for users:\n* [Python documentation](doc/build/html/index.html): also available in [readthedocs](http://namaster.readthedocs.io)\n* [Scientific documentation](doc/doc_scientific.pdf): description of the methods implemented in NaMaster\n* [C API documentation](doc/doc_C_API.pdf): description of the C library functionality and the NaMaster executable.\n\n\n## Dependencies\nNaMaster has the following dependencies, which should be present in your system before you can install the code from source:\n* [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). Version 2 required.\n* [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/). Version 3 required. Install with `--enable-openmp` and potentially also `--enable-shared`.\n* [cfitsio](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/). Any version >3 should work.\n\nBesides these, NaMaster will attempt to install the following two dependencies. If this fails, or if you'd like to use your own preinstalled versions, follow these instructions:\n* [libsharp](https://github.com/Libsharp/libsharp). Libsharp is automatically installed with NaMaster. `setup.py` attempts to download and install libsharp automatically. This is done by running the script `scripts/install_libsharp.sh`. If you encounter any trouble during this step, inspect the contents of that file. Libsharp gets installed in `_deps/lib` and `_deps/include`. However, if you want to use your own preinstalled version of libsharp, you should simlink it into the directory `_deps`, such that `_deps/lib/libsharp.a` can be seen. See instructions in [NERSC_installation.md](NERSC_installation.md) for more details on libsharp. \n* [HEALPix](https://sourceforge.net/projects/healpix/). Like libsharp, HEALPix is automatically installed by `setup.py` by running the script `scripts/install_libchealpix.sh` (have a look there if you run into trouble). HEALPix gets installed in `_deps/lib` and `_deps/include`. However, if you want to use your own preinstalled version , you should simlink it into the directory `_deps`, such that `_deps/lib/libchealpix.a` can be seen. Any version >2 should work. Only the C libraries are needed.\n\n\n## Licensing, credits and feedback\nYou are welcome to re-use the code, which is open source and freely available under terms consistent with BSD 3-Clause licensing (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).\n\nIf you use NaMaster for any scientific publication, we kindly ask you to cite this github repository and the companion paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09603.

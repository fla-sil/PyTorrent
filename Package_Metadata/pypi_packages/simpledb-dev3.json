You can install using [pip][pip] as follows:\n\n```\npip install simpledb-dev2\n```\n\nThis will install the package and its dependencies including [web.py][web-py]. Specify the `--user` option to the `pip` command line to install for the current user only.\n\nThis will create a `simpledb-dev2` script/executable on your path. You can start the simpledb-dev2 web server as follows:\n\n```\nsimpledb-dev2 serve\n```\n\nThis will serve the SimpleDB API on the default port of 8080. To specify an alternative port, use the `--port` option:\n\n```\nsimpledb-dev2 serve --port 1234\n```\n\nIf the server doesn't start, or you have other problems, it's pretty easy to run the tests and see some examples of request/response:\n\n```\nsimpledb-dev2 test\n```\n\nRemember, this is a development tool, and not meant for storing or querying large amounts of data&mdash;I do not know yet how big you can get before running into issues, but I suspect that with the current storage and querying design it is not that large :o) Now that I have a base, I may start trying to see how I can improve the performance&hellip;\n\nAlthough this conforms to the specifications in the technical documentation, simpledb-dev2 has not been tested with every possible SDB client library, and I am looking forward to people in the OSS community trying to find bugs and peculiarities&mdash;it is after all, a work in progress!\n\n_So enjoy developing your SimpleDB applications now, not later!_\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.

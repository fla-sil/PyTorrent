It allows a person to upload a mp3 and then play it on the website. It generates a rss/xml feed that you can submit to Itunes, Google and/or Blubrry.\n\nThis app is simple, and not feature rich. It does the basics and thats it. I will probably add more features and options to it as time permits, but only if requests are made.\n\nIt is also not production ready as there are **no tests currently written** for it. I did put this up on a site and they have been using it extensively and haven't had any reported issues. That said, *apps without tests should always be treated sceptically.*\n\nI hope to write tests in a month or so when I get a bit of free time. I also hope to add a bunch of features in the near future.\n\nPlease report any errors you encounter. I will try resolve them quickly and then add tests for them.

This is made only for audio podcasts though I may support video podcasts at a later stage since that doesn't require much changing.\n\n#. Seasons are currently not supported. This is really high on my list, but I haven't figured out a really great way to do it. The page hierarchy is already going to be a bit of a mess.\n\n#.

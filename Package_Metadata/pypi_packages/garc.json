Inspiration for structure, usage and outputs are from twarc, and garc is intended to be used for similar purposes.\n\nGarc is still very much a work in progress, and is being constantly updated to add deeper functionality and as new features and changes are implemented by Gab.\n\nGab has recently released a set of API docs (https://developers.gab.com/), which this current version does not use. A new version utilizing these new API routes is in development and will be released soon after Gab comes back online. Certain functionality, such as returning gabs via search, doesn't appear in these new docs. The new version will perserve this functionality as well as adding the additional feed based functionaality in the newly released docs.\n\n\n## Warnings\n\nGab's API was historically relatively sparsely documented, so things may change without warning and break searches. This current version relies on these potentially unreliable API routes. \n\nPlease be respectful when using this and any data collection software, try not to make excessive searches and calls.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are two options for installing garc. \n\n1. From pypi the official python package repository, which will always have the most stable release:\n    `pip install garc`\n2. Directly from Github, which will have the newest release:\n    `pip install git+git://github.com/ChrisStevens/garc.git`\n\n\n## Usage\n\n\n### Configure\n\nFirst you need to give garc your account information:\n\n    garc configure\n\nYou only need the username and password for your account created at Gab.ai. Without an account you won't be able to interact with the api, or get any results from garc.\n\n### Search\n\nUsing the Gab search API you can collect posts based on a search term. As Gab's API is mostly undoumented it is hard to know exactly what the searches return (it is however the same data as appears on the Gab website for a search). Initial tests have found matches for the search term in both the post body and the users description, and the search uses some type of fuzzy matching or word stemming, as matches for not exact terms have shown up.\n\nA simple call\n    \n    garc search maga\n\nWill return as many historical gabs as are available (usually around 9000 irrespective of post dates).\n\nYou can also limit the number of returns with the --number_gabs parameter\n\n    garc search maga --number_gabs=100\n\nWhich will return approxiately 100 of the most recent posts.\n\n\n\n### User Posts\n\nAnother way to collect posts is by collecting all the posts made by a single user\n\n    garc userposts fakeusername\n\nAs some users have a large number of posts this can take a long time to collect the entirey of a users timeline. Additional there are both number and time filters you can pass to limit the number of posts.\n\n    garc userposts fakeusername --number_gabs=100\n\nWill return aproximately 100 posts from the top of a users timeline\n\n    garc userposts fakeusername --gabs_after=2018-05-12\n\nWill return all gabs from after 2018-05-12\n\n\n### User info\n\nYou can also collect the information of a user\n\n    garc user fakeusername\n\nWhich will return a json object of information about the user", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/ChrisStevens/garc", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "garc", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/garc/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/garc/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/ChrisStevens/garc"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/garc/1.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Archive Gab.ai posts from the command line", "version": "1.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>garc: Python and Command-Line Interface for Gab.ai API</h1>\n<p>Garc is a python library and command line tool for collecting JSON data from Gab.ai</p>\n<p>Garc is built based on the wonderful <a href=\"https://github.com/DocNow/twarc\" rel=\"nofollow\">twarc</a> project published by the Documenting the Now project.

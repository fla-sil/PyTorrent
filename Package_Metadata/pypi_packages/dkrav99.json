All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nPython 3.x is a new version of the language, which is incompatible with the 2.x\r\nline of releases.  The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially\r\nhow built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed\r\nconsiderably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild Instructions\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nOn Unix, Linux, BSD, OSX, and Cygwin:\r\n\r\nNew text\r\n\r\n    ./configure\r\n    make\r\n    make test\r\n    sudo make install\r\n\r\nThis will install Python as python3.\r\n\r\nYou can pass many options to the configure script; run \"./configure --help\" to\r\nfind out more.  On OSX and Cygwin, the executable is called python.exe;\r\nelsewhere it's just python.\r\n\r\nOn Mac OS X, if you have configured Python with --enable-framework, you should\r\nuse \"make frameworkinstall\" to do the installation.  Note that this installs the\r\nPython executable in a place that is not normally on your PATH, you may want to\r\nset up a symlink in /usr/local/bin.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, see PCbuild/readme.txt.\r\n\r\nIf you wish, you can create a subdirectory and invoke configure from there.  For\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n    mkdir debug\r\n    cd debug\r\n    ../configure --with-pydebug\r\n    make\r\n    make test\r\n\r\n(This will fail if you *also* built at the top-level directory.  You should do a\r\n\"make clean\" at the toplevel first.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nWe try to have a comprehensive overview of the changes in the \"What's New in\r\nPython 3.3\" document, found at\r\n\r\n    http://docs.python.org/3.3/whatsnew/3.3.html\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed change log, read Misc/NEWS (though this file, too, is\r\nincomplete, and also doesn't list anything merged in from the 2.7 release under\r\ndevelopment).\r\n\r\nIf you want to install multiple versions of Python see the section below\r\nentitled \"Installing multiple versions\".\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nDocumentation for Python 3.3 is online, updated daily:\r\n\r\n    http://docs.python.org/3.3/\r\n\r\nIt can also be downloaded in many formats for faster access.  The documentation\r\nis downloadable in HTML, PDF, and reStructuredText formats; the latter version\r\nis primarily for documentation authors, translators, and people with special\r\nformatting requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nConverting From Python 2.x to 3.x\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nPython starting with 2.6 contains features to help locating code that needs to\r\nbe changed, such as optional warnings when deprecated features are used, and\r\nbackported versions of certain key Python 3.x features.\r\n\r\nA source-to-source translation tool, \"2to3\", can take care of the mundane task\r\nof converting large amounts of source code.  It is not a complete solution but\r\nis complemented by the deprecation warnings in 2.6.  See\r\nhttp://docs.python.org/3.3/library/2to3.html for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTo test the interpreter, type \"make test\" in the top-level directory.  The test\r\nset produces some output.  You can generally ignore the messages about skipped\r\ntests due to optional features which can't be imported.  If a message is printed\r\nabout a failed test or a traceback or core dump is produced, something is wrong.\r\n\r\nBy default, tests are prevented from overusing resources like disk space and\r\nmemory.  To enable these tests, run \"make testall\".\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: If the tests fail and you decide to mail a bug report, *don't*\r\ninclude the output of \"make test\".  It is useless.  Run the failing test\r\nmanually, as follows:\r\n\r\n        ./python -m test -v test_whatever\r\n\r\n(substituting the top of the source tree for '.' if you built in a different\r\ndirectory).  This runs the test in verbose mode.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling multiple versions\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nOn Unix and Mac systems if you intend to install multiple versions of Python\r\nusing the same installation prefix (--prefix argument to the configure script)\r\nyou must take care that your primary python executable is not overwritten by the\r\ninstallation of a different version.  All files and directories installed using\r\n\"make altinstall\" contain the major and minor version and can thus live\r\nside-by-side.  \"make install\" also creates ${prefix}/bin/python3 which refers to\r\n${prefix}/bin/pythonX.Y.  If you intend to install multiple versions using the\r\nsame prefix you must decide which version (if any) is your \"primary\" version.\r\nInstall that version using \"make install\".  Install all other versions using\r\n\"make altinstall\".\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want to install Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3 with 2.7 being the\r\nprimary version, you would execute \"make install\" in your 2.7 build directory\r\nand \"make altinstall\" in the others.\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue Tracker and Mailing List\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe're soliciting bug reports about all aspects of the language.  Fixes are also\r\nwelcome, preferable in unified diff format.  Please use the issue tracker:\r\n\r\n    http://bugs.python.org/\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure whether you're dealing with a bug or a feature, use the\r\nmailing list:\r\n\r\n    python-dev@python.org\r\n\r\nTo subscribe to the list, use the mailman form:\r\n\r\n    http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev/\r\n\r\n\r\nProposals for enhancement\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you have a proposal to change Python, you may want to send an email to the\r\ncomp.lang.python or python-ideas mailing lists for inital feedback.  A Python\r\nEnhancement Proposal (PEP) may be submitted if your idea gains ground.

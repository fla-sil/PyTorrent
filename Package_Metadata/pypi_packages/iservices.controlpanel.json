The idea behind this control panel is that\nplone administrators (and not the integrator or programmer) will have the\nability to:\n\n* Define social accounts for use all over the site, specially on themes. The\n  programmer/integrator will have to integrate it's product or theme with this\n  control panel (hopefully an easy_step) and get this settings to be applied on\n  their logic.\n\n* Allows to change the global background and foreground colors that plone uses\n  to draw it's interface on plonetheme.sunburs (Actually, only two colors). If the\n  user requires more than that, it might be better to craft a complete theme\n  product.\n\n* Change the plone logo. The site administrator can change the logo. This\n  provides an easy plone theming deployment without the cost of creating a theme\n  from scratch just to change the logo.\n\n* Change the footer and colophon text. The site administrator can change the\n  text of the footer and colophon without needing the programmer to make changes\n  to any theme.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nInstall using buildout\n-----------------------\n\nAdd ``iservices.controlpanel`` to your ``eggs`` subsection::\n\n    eggs = \n        ...\n        iservices.controlpanel\n\nThis package depends on a set of other packages, hopefully, all packages should\nbe pulled from pypi automatically. However, you'll have to adjust the\n``extends`` subsection according to the following pattern::\n\n    extends =\n        http://dist.plone.org/release/<plone-version>/versions.cfg\n        ...\n        http://good-py.appspot.com/release/plone.app.z3cform/0.5.0-1?plone=<plone-version>\n        http://good-py.appspot.com/release/plone.app.registry/1.0b2?plone=<plone-version>\n\nReplace ``<plone-version>`` with the Plone version you are working on, i.e., ``4.0.3``\n\nHow to use it on your packages and themes\n-----------------------------------------\n\nOf course, If you use this package, you'd want access to the settings it\nmanages, right? This package has a small API that encapsulates the the\nboilerplate code and makes it easy to you to use it.\n\nIn order to\naccess the settings of the control panel, you just use a very simple module\nimport::\n\n    >>> from iservices.controlpanel.api import settings\n\nAll settings are available using standar Python dot notation. Example::\n\n    >>> settings.background_color\n    u'#205C90'\n\nIf you access an unknown name, you will get an AttributeError:\n\n    >>> registry.some_unknown_key\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    NameError: name 'registry' is not defined\n    \nAlso, using getattr(), even on an existing key name, does not make it:\n\n    >>> getattr(settings,background_color)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    NameError: name 'background_color' is not defined\n\nSometimes, settings on the control panel will have empty values. It is suggested\nthat, when this happens, the funcionality related to this particular setting\nshould be disabled or modified in some way.\n\n    >>> def do_something_with(some_setting):\n    ...     if some_setting:\n    ...             print \"Doing stuff when this registry entry is set.\"\n    ...     else:\n    ...             print \"Disable functionality when this registry is not set.\"\n    ... \n    >>> # the twitterlink setting is empty by default\n    >>> print settings.twitterlink\n    None\n    \n    >>> do_something_with(settings.twitterlink)\n    Disable functionality when this registry is not set.\n    \n    >>> settings.twitterlink = 'http://twitter.com/tzicatl'\n    >>> do_something_with(settings.twitterlink)\n    Doing stuff when this registry entry is set.\n    \nAnd that's all there is for the API.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthor\n    Noe Nieto <noe@iservices.com.mx>\n\nWebsites\n    http://iservices.com.mx/\n    http://noenieto.com/\n    \nContact-email\n    desarrollo@iservices.com.mx\n\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n0.3.1 - March 16th, 2011\n----------------------\n- Rename README.rst -> README.txt\n\n0.3 - March 16th, 2011\n----------------------\n\n- Add tests for the custom css view and fix different problems around. \n\n- Add a browser layer to override the colophon and footer.

Impossible-to-crack passwords are complex with multiple types of \ncharacters (numbers, letters, and symbols). \nSo if you want to safeguard your personal info and assets, creating secure passwords is a big first step and \nCryptOn will help you to achieve it.\n\nIt is usual in the computer industry to specify password strength in terms of information entropy which is measured \nin bits and is a concept from information theory. Instead of the number of guesses needed to find the password \nwith certainty, the base-2 logarithm of that number is given, which is the number of \"entropy bits\" in a password.\n\n**Cryptography**\n\nCryptography (or crypto) is one of the more advanced topics of information security, and one whose understanding \nrequires the most schooling and experience. It is difficult to get right because there are many approaches to \nencryption, each with advantages and disadvantages that need to be thoroughly understood by web solution architects \nand developers. In addition, serious cryptography research is typically based in advanced mathematics and number theory,\nproviding a serious barrier to entry.\n\nThe proper and accurate implementation of cryptography is extremely critical to its efficacy. A small mistake in \nconfiguration or coding will result in removing a large degree of the protection it affords and rending the crypto \nimplementation useless against serious attacks. A good understanding of crypto is required to be able to discern \nbetween solid products and snake oil. The inherent complexity of crypto makes it easy to fall for fantastic claims \nfrom vendors about their product. Typically, these are \u201ca breakthrough in cryptography\u201d or \u201cunbreakable\u201d or provide \n\"military grade\" security. If a vendor says \"trust us, we have had experts look at this,\u201d chances are they weren't \nexperts!\n\nCryptography at its very core is math. Pure, simple, undiluted math. Math created the algorithms that are the basis \nfor all encryption. And encryption is the basis for privacy and security on the internet. So, we love math. Even if it \nis a tad complicated. With that being said, algorithms have to be built to work against computers. As computers get \nsmarter, algorithms become weaker and we must therefore look at new solutions. This is how cryptography evolves to beat \nthe bad guys. So how is it done? First you need to build a cryptosystem that is both confidential and authentic. \nThis cryptosystem is responsible for creating the key(s) that will be used to encrypt and then decrypt the data or \nmessage. A number of signing algorithms have been created over the years to create these keys, some of which have since \nbeen deprecated as computing power has increased.\n\nIt is commonly used in:\n\n   - SSH Authentication\n   - SSL Certficates\n   - VPN Tunnel Encryption\n   - Email & Messaging Encryption\n   - Etc\n   \n If you want more information about, try this glossaries and guides:\n \n   - [cryptographic algorithms]\n   - [cryptographic protocols]\n   - [PGP in email]\n   - [New Elliptic Curve]\n\nRequirements\n----------\n  - python 3\n  - pip\n  - termcolor\n  - cryptography\n  - pycryptodomex\n  - requests\n  - validate_email\n  - py3dns\n\n\nInstallation\n-------------\n\nFirst of all, we would python 3, pip and openssl installed in our computer.\n\n**Linux**\n\n ```\n $ apt-get install python3-pip\n $ apt-get install openssl\n ```\n \n**MacOS**\n ```\n $ brew install python3\n $ brew install pip\n $ brew install openssl\n \n ```\n **Windows**\n \nDownload python 3 and pip from [python webpage] and openssl from [openssl webpage].\n \n \nSecondly, we install the tool using the traditional installation from **pip**\n\n ```\n $ easy_install3 -U pip # you have to install python3-setuptools , update pip\n $ pip3 install crypton\n $ crypton # installed successfully\n```\n\nUsage\n----------\n\n**Run**\n```\n$ crypton\n```\n\n**Options**\n```\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -v, --version         See script version\n  -g [length [number ...]], --generate-password [length [number ...]]\n                        Secure passwords generation // Defaults: length (20) -\n                        number of passwords (1)\n  -c password, --check-password password\n                        Passwords strength & security checks\n  -i, --interactive     Run script in interactive mode\n\n```\n\n**Notes**\n\nIN SOME CASES, if your password contains the special characters you may have problems when parsing. That's because of \nyour shell. You should type ``` \\ ``` before each special character in the password.\n\nFor macOS users maybe you need to setup these settings:\n\n ```\nenv ARCHFLAGS=\"-arch x86_64\" \n    LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib\" \n    CFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include\" \n\npip install cryptography\n ```\n\nContributing\n------------\nFor bug reports or enhancements, please open an [issue] here.\n\n[OWASP criteria]: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet#Implement_Proper_Password_Strength_Controls\n[issue]: https://github.com/OverwatchHeir/CryptOn/issues\n[python webpage]: https://www.python.org\n[openssl webpage]:https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html\n[OWASP Guidelines for enforcing secure passwords]: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet#Implement_Proper_Password_Strength_Controls\n[New Elliptic Curve]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet\n[PGP in email]:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbkB_jNG-zE\n[cryptographic algorithms]: https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/glossary-of-cryptographic-algorithms/\n[cryptographic protocols]: https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/crypto.html", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/OverwatchHeir/CryptOn/archive/master.zip", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/OverwatchHeir/CryptOn.git", "keywords": "", "license": "GNU", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "crypton", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/crypton/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/crypton/", "project_urls": {"Download": "https://github.com/OverwatchHeir/CryptOn/archive/master.zip", "Homepage": "https://github.com/OverwatchHeir/CryptOn.git"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/crypton/1.0.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "", "version": "1.0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h2>CryptOn</h2>\n<p>CryptOn is an open-source tool that allows :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Secure passwords generation based on <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet#Implement_Proper_Password_Strength_Controls\" rel=\"nofollow\">OWASP criteria</a>.</li>\n<li>Passwords strength &amp; security checks based on <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet#Implement_Proper_Password_Strength_Controls\" rel=\"nofollow\">OWASP Guidelines for enforcing secure passwords</a>.</li>\n<li>Symmetric cryptography*</li>\n<li>Asymmetric cryptography*</li>\n<li>Hash Algorithms*</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>*only in interactive mode</em></p>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p><strong>Passwords</strong></p>\n<p>Passwords are a real security threat.

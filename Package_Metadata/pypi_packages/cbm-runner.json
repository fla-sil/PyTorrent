Notably in relation to the CBM-CFS3 model developed by Canada.\n\n## Warnings\n\nThis package is currently under heavy development and the master branch is subject to breaking changes at each commit. If you are interested in using this package in your own installation, please contact the authors.\n\n## Installing\n\nNo automated installation has been developed for the `cbm_runner` package yet. In the meantime, following this document and typing these commands on your command-line interface should get you started. If you cannot get a functional installation set up, contact the authors.\n\n#### Step 1: Cloning the repository\nHere you will download a copy of the code from github and place it in your file system.\n\n    $ cd /\n    $ mkdir repos\n    $ cd repos\n    $ git clone https://emsincllu@webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/stash/scm/bioeconomy/cbm_runner.git\n\nNB: Currently the access to this repository is restricted.\n\n#### Step 2: Modify your python search path\nHere you will edit your ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_profile`` to add a reference to the module you just downloaded. If you are on Windows, you can change your environment variables with the `setx` command.\n\n    $ vim ~/.bash_profile\n    export PYTHONPATH=\"/repos/cbm_runner/\":$PYTHONPATH\n\nWhen you type `import cbm_runner` python will know where to look.\n\n#### Step 4: Install all required python packages\n`cbm_runner` uses many third party python libraries. You can get them by running these commands:\n\n    $ pip install --user autopaths\n    $ pip install --user plumbing\n    $ pip install --user pymarktex\n    $ pip install --user pbs\n\n#### Step 3: Follow other instructions\n\nSetting up the machine and installing the required programs is covered in hte `gcbmio` repository.\n\n## Data Flowchart\nBelow is drawn the flowchart describing the data processing along all the steps of `cbm_runner`:\n\n![Flowchart](documentation/data_flowchart.png)\n\n## Objects Diagram\nBelow is presented a tentative UML-style diagram detailing not the inheritance of the classes but the use of the composition design pattern between the objects created.\n\n![Diagram](documentation/objects_diagram.png)\n\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "cbm-runner", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/cbm-runner/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/cbm-runner/", "project_urls": null, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/cbm-runner/0.2.0/", "requires_dist": ["autopaths", "plumbing", "pymarktex", "pbs"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "cbm_runner is a python package for running carbon budget simulations.", "version": "0.2.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p># <cite>cbm_runner</cite> version 0.2.0</p>\n<p>Here, <cite>cbm_runner</cite> is a python package for dealing with the automation and running of a complex series of models involving the European economy, carbon budgets and their interactions.

Create an object instance.\n2. Initiate communication with the `comms()` method.\n3. Interface with the API with the provided methods.\n\n# Mobility Master API\n\nBelow is an explanation of to get up and running with the Mobility Master API (aka. Aruba OS8 for wireless)\n\nThe minimum required for this option is to create an instance without any attributes like below.\n```python\nmmc = MMClient()\n```\nIn this case, after calling the `comms()` method you are asked for the MM's FQDN, username and password.\n\nYou can provide one or both when creating a new instance and be asked about the other once the `comms()` method is run.\n\nYou can also provide one or all required attributes at instantiation.\n```python\nmmc = MMClient(aw_username=\"theuser\")\n```\n\nThere are various other parameters you can use with the instance object, like port, proxy, api version, etc. You can read more about them in the docstring.\n\n## Communicating with the Mobility Master\nYou must call the `comms()` method on your instance, to setup the communication with your MM.\n```python\naw = comms()\n```\n\n## Using methods to get data\nFor getting the data from your MM, you use the resource methods or the `resource` method itself. In either case you might need to pass in some arguments and for using the `resource` method itself, you will definitely need to pass in at least the method and endpoint from which you want to retrieve data.\n\nThe inbuilt resource methods begin their docsting with `RM` and are named as the endpoint as defined with Aruba API. For example, you use the `ap_group()` method to get data about AP groups at a certain `config_path` level from the `configuration/object/ap_group` URI. These methods are pretty similar to the `resource` one otherwise, but are here for easier (more human readable) interfacing with the API.\n\n**Ex.: Comparison between resource methods and the resource method itself**\nThe below example shows that RMs use the resource() method with correct arguments passed in to GET or POST the data from an endpoint.\n```Python\n>>> mm.ap_group() == mm.resource(method='GET', endpoint='configuration/object/ap_group')\nTrue\n```\n\n**Ex: Basic getting of data**\nThe below will return all defined AP groups at the `/md` config level.\n```python\n>>> mm.ap_group()\n\"({'_data': {'ap_group': [{'profile-name': 'default', '_flags': ....\"\n```\n### Config level\nThe default config level (specified with the `config_path`) is `/md` unless specified otherwise.\n```python\nmm.ap_group(config_path='/md/mylevel_A/mylevel_B')\n```\n\n### Filtering\nFilters are activated when passing in a `profile_name` argument. If specifying only that though the filter will default to `$eq` (equals), so the `profile_name` must match what you are looking for\n\n```python\n>>> mm.ap_group(profile_name='default') == mm.ap_group(profile_name='default', filter_oper='$eq')\nTrue\n```\n\nYou can pass in a `filter_oper` with the `profile_name` if you wish to have a different search option or if passing in a partial search string.\n**Ex. 1: partial search string with $in**\nThis will return all profiles with `def` in their profile-name.\n```python\nmm.ap_group(profile_name='def', filter_oper='$in')\n```\n**Ex. 2: partial search string with $nin**\nThis will return all profiles that `def` is NOT in their profile-name.\n```python\nmm.ap_group(profile_name='def', filter_oper='$nin')\n```\n\nYou can even pass in the whole filter with the `filter` argument if you so wish. If using that it will override whichever else you wanted to use as a filter, i.e. The `profile_name` and `filter_oper` will be ignored in this case, as in the end the previous examples construct the same string as the example below has passed into it, but whereas you can only look for profile names with the `profile_name` and `filter_oper`, you can filter on anything else with the `filter` parameter.\n**Ex. 3: Passing in the whole filter**\nThis will return all profiles that `def` is NOT in their profile-name.\n```python\nmm.ap_group(filter='[ {\"ap_group.profile-name\" : { \"$eq\" : [\"default\"] } } ]')\n```\n\nFor more information on how to use Aruba filters read the docstring and the associated Aruba API documentation.\n\n## Debugging\n\nThe default debug level is `ERROR`, which can be changed per method call by preempting it with `logzero.loglevel(logging.LEVEL)` where `LEVEL` is the logging level. Each method then resets logging to `ERROR`, so you need to set logging level before each one.\n\n**Ex. 1: DEBUG level**\n```python\n>>> logzero.loglevel(logging.DEBUG)\n>>> mm.write_mem()\n[I 200503 21:38:12 mmclient:506] Calling write_mem()\n[I 200503 21:38:12 mmclient:237] Calling _params()\n[D 200503 21:38:12 mmclient:281] Returned params: {'config_path': None, 'UIDARUBA': 'N2EyMDU5NGItZjRiYy00M2JhLWFjOTgtZWJk'}\n[I 200503 21:38:12 mmclient:334] Calling _api_call()\n[I 200503 21:38:12 mmclient:335] Method is: POST\n[I 200503 21:38:12 mmclient:336] SSL verify (False or cert path): False\n[D 200503 21:38:12 mmclient:340] Full URL: https://your_host:4343/v1/configuration/object/write_memory?UIDARUBA=N2EyMDU5NGItZjRiYy00M2JhLWFjOTgtZWJk\n[D 200503 21:38:12 mmclient:346] Response JSON: {'write_memory': {'_result': {'status': 0, 'status_str': 'Success'}}, '_global_result': {'status': 0, 'status_str': 'Success', '_pending': False}}\n```\n**Ex. 2: INFO level**\n```python\n>>> logzero.loglevel(logging.INFO)\n>>> mm.write_mem()\n[I 200503 21:39:22 mmclient:506] Calling write_mem()\n[I 200503 21:39:22 mmclient:237] Calling _params()\n[I 200503 21:39:22 mmclient:334] Calling _api_call()\n[I 200503 21:39:22 mmclient:335] Method is: POST\n[I 200503 21:39:22 mmclient:336] SSL verify (False or cert path): False\n```\n\n# AirWave API\n\nAirWaves API is quite different to what you could expect from a modern day one as it practically doesn't have any endpoints. There are about three available if not mistaken and only 2 of those are currently being used by this module, the `/client_detail.xml` and `/ap_detail.xml`.\n\nNote here that the returned data is in XML format, but that is handled by the module and for the resource methods data is retuned in JSON (dictionary) format. There is an option to get the data in the original XML format, with the use of the `_full_raw_airwave_inventory()` method with a `return_in_dict` argument set to `False`, but it would be surprising if you'd need to use that at all.\n\nThe very important thing to remember here is that once you want to access any of the resource methods that get you the required database from AW, like `get_controller_inventory()`, which returns the database of the controller's id and it's FQDN mappings for example, ALL other databases are built as well. This is due to AW returning the whole DB of every element it holds when accessing the `/ap_detail.xml`, which can take tens of seconds to complete, depending on the number of elements in your AW and the hardware supporting it. Therefore it is much more efficient to build all DBs that the module returns at first call to any of the `get_` methods than for each one. Also due to this the AW class is made so that only one instance can be made in a script, so as to not overburden the AW with unnecessary calls.\n\nThe minimum required for this option is to create an instance without any attributes like below.\n```python\naw = AirWave()\n```\nIn this case, after calling the `comms()` method you are asked for the AW's FQDN, username and password.\n\nYou can provide one or both when creating a new instance and be asked about the other once the `comms()` method is run.\n\nYou can also provide one or all required attributes at instantiation.\n```python\naw = AirWave(aw_username=\"theuser\")\n```\n\n## Communicating with the Mobility Master\nYou must call the `comms()` method on your instance, to setup the communication with your MM.\n```python\naw = comms()\n```\n\n## Additional\n\nThere are various other parameters you can use with the instance object, like port, proxy, api version, etc. You can read more about them in the docstring.\n\n##Debugging\n\nThe default debug level is `ERROR`, which can be changed per method call by preempting it with `logzero.loglevel(logging.LEVEL)` where `LEVEL` is the logging level. Each method then resets logging to `ERROR`, so you need to set logging level before each one.\n\n**Ex. 1: DEBUG level**\n```python\n>>> logzero.loglevel(logging.DEBUG)\n>>> mm._controller_inventory()\n```\n**Ex. 2: INFO level**\n```python\n>>> logzero.loglevel(logging.INFO)\n>>> mm._controller_inventory()\n```\n\n# TODO\nThe general TODO list is:\n- add more/all Aruba systems\n- add mora/all API URIs\n\n# Contributing\nThank you for helping us develop `arubafi`.

There are about three available if not mistaken and only 2 of those are currently being used by this module, the <code>/client_detail.xml</code> and <code>/ap_detail.xml</code>.</p>\n<p>Note here that the returned data is in XML format, but that is handled by the module and for the resource methods data is retuned in JSON (dictionary) format. There is an option to get the data in the original XML format, with the use of the <code>_full_raw_airwave_inventory()</code> method with a <code>return_in_dict</code> argument set to <code>False</code>, but it would be surprising if you'd need to use that at all.</p>\n<p>The very important thing to remember here is that once you want to access any of the resource methods that get you the required database from AW, like <code>get_controller_inventory()</code>, which returns the database of the controller's id and it's FQDN mappings for example, ALL other databases are built as well. This is due to AW returning the whole DB of every element it holds when accessing the <code>/ap_detail.xml</code>, which can take tens of seconds to complete, depending on the number of elements in your AW and the hardware supporting it. Therefore it is much more efficient to build all DBs that the module returns at first call to any of the <code>get_</code> methods than for each one. Also due to this the AW class is made so that only one instance can be made in a script, so as to not overburden the AW with unnecessary calls.</p>\n<p>The minimum required for this option is to create an instance without any attributes like below.</p>\n<pre><span class=\"n\">aw</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">AirWave</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</pre>\n<p>In this case, after calling the <code>comms()</code> method you are asked for the AW's FQDN, username and password.</p>\n<p>You can provide one or both when creating a new instance and be asked about the other once the <code>comms()</code> method is run.</p>\n<p>You can also provide one or all required attributes at instantiation.</p>\n<pre><span class=\"n\">aw</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">AirWave</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">aw_username</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">\"theuser\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre>\n<h2>Communicating with the Mobility Master</h2>\n<p>You must call the <code>comms()</code> method on your instance, to setup the communication with your MM.</p>\n<pre><span class=\"n\">aw</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">comms</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</pre>\n<h2>Additional</h2>\n<p>There are various other parameters you can use with the instance object, like port, proxy, api version, etc. You can read more about them in the docstring.</p>\n<p>##Debugging</p>\n<p>The default debug level is <code>ERROR</code>, which can be changed per method call by preempting it with <code>logzero.loglevel(logging.LEVEL)</code> where <code>LEVEL</code> is the logging level. Each method then resets logging to <code>ERROR</code>, so you need to set logging level before each one.</p>\n<p><strong>Ex. 1: DEBUG level</strong></p>\n<pre><span class=\"o\">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">logzero</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">loglevel</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">logging</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">DEBUG</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"o\">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">mm</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">_controller_inventory</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Ex. 2: INFO level</strong></p>\n<pre><span class=\"o\">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">logzero</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">loglevel</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">logging</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">INFO</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"o\">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">mm</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">_controller_inventory</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</pre>\n<h1>TODO</h1>\n<p>The general TODO list is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add more/all Aruba systems</li>\n<li>add mora/all API URIs</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Contributing</h1>\n<p>Thank you for helping us develop <code>arubafi</code>.

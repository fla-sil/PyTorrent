Therefore those tasks need to be fully automated, as otherwise a lot of time is being wasted and, what\u2019s even worse, a lot of additional uncertainty is introduced. Manually performed actions are prone to errors.\n\nAnd this is what *EOSFactory* actually brings to the table: an easy & intuitive way to automate the process of dealing with smart-contracts. Write down, in the form of a Python script, what needs to be done multiple times in exactly the same way and exactly the same context, and then just run the script. *EOSFactory* will take care of everything else: it will compile your smart-contract, create a new local testnet, deploy the contract, invoke its methods and verify the response, then tear down the testnet, and finally report the results. And all of this done in a couple of seconds.\n\nMain features\n-------------\n\nObject-oriented\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWhen you use tools like `cleos` all you have at your disposal is issuing separate, one-off commands, as `cleos` is not able to keep your state. Thus each time you interact with a contract, you need to tell `cleos` which contract and which account you mean. Contrary to that, in *EOSFactory* everything is an object. You create a contract (or an account), keep reference to it and then invoke its various methods.\n\nSimple syntax\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe front-end of *EOSFactory* is simply a Python3 *Command Line Interface*. This way you can interact with EOS smart-contract, and prove it works as expected, instead having to deal with the raw primitives of the EOSIO `cleos`. In most cases Python syntax is immediately clear for everyone.\n\nSupport for both local and remote testnet\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nRunning tests on a public testnet is much more complex than using a local one where you have full control. The whole infrastructure of *EOSFactory* is designed in such a way that the same test is able to work in both environments, and switching between them is just a matter of changing one parameter.\n\nAliases for account names\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n*EOSIO* accounts are indexed by their names, thus those names have to be unique within the blockchain namespace and have to follow specific restrictions. As a result, most of the human readable combinations are already taken, even in a testnet environment. *EOSFactory* hides the actual names of an *EOSIO* accounts behind a system of human-friendly aliases.\n\nTruly cross-platform\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWe make sure everything we do is fully compatible with Windows - our toolset enables you to run an EOS node and interact with it on any operating system, including Windows, MacOS and Linux. \n\nUser documentation\n------------------\n\n* `Introduction to EOSFactory <http://eosfactory.io/build/html/tutorials/00.IntroductionToEOSFactory.html>`_\n* `Installing EOSFactory <https://eosfactory.io/build/html/tutorials/01.InstallingEOSFactory.html>`_\n* `Interacting with EOS Contracts in EOSFactory <https://eosfactory.io/build/html/tutorials/02.InteractingWithEOSContractsInEOSFactory.html>`_\n* `Building and deploying EOS Contracts in EOSFactory <https://eosfactory.io/build/html/tutorials/03.BuildingAndDeployingEOSContractsInEOSFactory.html>`_\n* `Working with EOS Contracts using EOSFactory in VSC <https://eosfactory.io/build/html/tutorials/04.WorkingWithEOSContractsUsingEOSFactoryInVSC.html>`_\n* `Interacting with Public Testnet <https://eosfactory.io/build/html/tutorials/05.InteractingWithPublicTestnet.html>`_\n\nUse cases\n---------\n\n* `Wallet Class <https://eosfactory.io/build/html/cases/wallet.html>`_\n* `Symbolic Names <https://eosfactory.io/build/html/cases/symbolic_names.html>`_\n* `Account Class <https://eosfactory.io/build/html/cases/account.html>`_\n* `Master Account <https://eosfactory.io/build/html/cases/master_account.html>`_\n\nComplete documentation\n----------------------\n\nPlease refer to the `table of contents <https://eosfactory.io/build/html/index.html>`_.\n\n\nRoadmap\n-------\n\nOur final goal is to turn *EOSFactory* into a comprehensive IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for EOS smart-contracts.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nFor issues not covered in the documentation there is a dedicated `EOS Factory Support <https://t.me/EOSFactorySupport>`_ channel on Telegram.\n\nLicence\n-------\n\nThis code is provided as is, under MIT Licence.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory", "keywords": "EOSIO,smart contract unit testing", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "eosfactory-olexiyb", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/eosfactory-olexiyb/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/eosfactory-olexiyb/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/eosfactory-olexiyb/3.4.2/", "requires_dist": ["termcolor", "psutil"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Python-based EOS smart-contract development & testing framework", "version": "3.4.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p><a href=\"http://eosfactory.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">EOSFactory</a> is a Python-based <a href=\"https://eos.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">EOS</a> smart-contract development &amp; testing framework, created by <a href=\"https://tokenika.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tokenika</a>.</p>\n<p>With a single command-line interface you can create a private testnet and then compile, test and deploy EOS smart-contracts.</p>\n<p>All of this using intuitive yet powerful <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Python</a> syntax.</p>\n<div id=\"why-its-needed\">\n<h2>Why it\u2019s needed?</h2>\n<p>Code development and testing involve tasks that need to be executed hundreds of times, and each time in exactly the same way and exactly the same context.

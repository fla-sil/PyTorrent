One example you may have encountered is the obligitory Country-State-City\nselect box.\n\nThis plugin makes it easy to render a form based on input. Plus, it works\nwithout JavaScript! The plugin will automatically detect if JasvaScript is\nturned off, and render a submit button for continuing.\n\nConsequently, the form is resubmitted whether someone is using Javascript or no\nJavascript. **Any developer using this plugin must plan accordingly.**\n\n# Requirements\n\nSince this is a Django plugin, obviously django must be installed. Besides that,\nyou must have jquery installed and linked within the page that uses FieldTree\nin order to use the javascript functionality.\n\n# Getting Started\n\n\n1. You can install moreforms by typing\n\n    $ pip install django-moreforms\n    \nin the command line.\n\n2. Ensure that 'moreforms' is listed in INSTALLED_APPS in `settings.py`:\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        ...\n        'moreforms',\n        ...\n    )\n    \n3. Finally, to construct the FieldTree, do the following:\n\n    from django import forms\n    from moreforms import FieldTree as T, FieldLeaf as L\n    \n    class MyForm(forms.Form):\n        name = forms.CharField(...)\n        age = forms.IntegerField(...)\n        ...\n        \n        # Every form with a FieldTree must have a delete_field method. I'll\n        # explain later...\n        def delete_field(self, name):\n            del self.field[name]\n        \n        # Make sure to override the __init__ method.\n        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        \n            request = kwargs.pop('request', None) # Don't add request as an\n                                                    #  argument itself.\n                                                    \n            super(MyForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n            \n            tree = T(request, self,\n                L(None, 'name', children=(\n                    L('.*', 'age'),\n                ))\n            )\n            \n            tree.vacuum()\n                \n4. Within the django template you need to load the template tags:\n\n    {% load moreforms %}\n    \n    {{ form.as_p }} {% auto_submit %}\n    \n`auto_submit` will render both the javascript and the non-script portions\nof the FieldTree.\n                \n## What the code does.\n\n`FieldTree` is, essentially a tree, where each leaf has a regular expression,\na name of a field, and (optionally) any children, which--in themselves--are\nleaves.\n\nThe **regular expression** is what is expected from the parent's field. In\nthe above example, we want to render the 'age' field if the value of\n'name' is posted. Note that the top-most leaf ('name') has `None` as the\nregexp. This is becaue **the top-most leaf must have a None regexp.**\n\n## That's it!\n\nNow, just create the form in the view, taking care to pass in `request` as well.\n\n    def my_view(request):\n    \n        form = MyForm(request)\n        return render(request, 'some_page.html', {'form' : form})\n        \n# A Few Notes\n\n## `delete_field` function.\n\nSince a FieldTree cannot delete the fields on the passed-in form directly,\nthey must be deleted manually from the form. Basically you just need the lines\nprovided in the example.\n\n## Default input value\n\nIf you want a default input value (e.g. automatically fill in the submitted\n`name`), do the following in the form:\n\n    class MyForm(forms.Form):\n        ...\n        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n            ...\n            super(...).__init__(...)\n            ...\n            self.initial = {'name' : ... }\n            \nThis is standard for django forms, but just thought you'd like to know.\n\n## You might want a note...\n\nYou might want a note preceeding the form to explain how the TreeField works.\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "UNKNOWN", "keywords": null, "license": "UNKNOWN", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "django-moreforms", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-moreforms/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-moreforms/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "UNKNOWN"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-moreforms/1.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Contains helpful fields for Django, such as a FieldTree (a simple way to get a field chain) and date-related fields.", "version": "1.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            # Purpose of Field Tree<br><br>This plugin is a wrapper for dynamic form rendering, and works even for users<br>that block scripts (gasp!

It combines the capabilities of the ``strfile`` command\r\n(which produces the fortune index file) and the ``fortune`` command (which\r\ndisplays a random fortune). It reads the traditional ``fortune`` program's\r\ntext file format.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nUsage::\r\n\r\n    fortune [OPTIONS] /path/to/fortunes\r\n\r\n    OPTIONS\r\n\r\n    -h, --help      Show usage and exit.\r\n    -u, --update    Update the index file.\r\n    -q, --quiet     When updating the index file, do so quietly.\r\n    -V, --version   Show version and exit.\r\n\r\nIf you omit the path, ``fortune`` looks at the ``FORTUNE_FILE`` environment\r\nvariable. If that environment variable isn't set, ``fortune`` aborts.\r\n\r\nFortune Cookie File Format\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nA fortune cookie file is a text file full of quotes. The format is simple:\r\nThe file consists of paragraphs separated by lines containing a single '%'\r\ncharacter. For example::\r\n\r\n    A little caution outflanks a large cavalry.\r\n        -- Bismarck\r\n    %\r\n    A little retrospection shows that although many fine, useful software\r\n    systems have been designed by committees and built as part of multipart\r\n    projects, those software systems that have excited passionate fans are\r\n    those that are the products of one or a few designing minds, great\r\n    designers. Consider Unix, APL, Pascal, Modula, the Smalltalk interface,\r\n    even Fortran; and contrast them with Cobol, PL/I, Algol, MVS/370, and\r\n    MS-DOS.\r\n        -- Fred Brooks, Jr.\r\n    %\r\n    A man is not old until regrets take the place of dreams.\r\n        -- John Barrymore\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Index File\r\n==============\r\n\r\nFor efficiency and speed, ``fortune`` uses an index file to store the offsets\r\nand lengths of every fortune in the text fortune file. So, before you can use\r\n``fortune`` to read a random fortune, you have to generate the data file. With\r\nthe traditional BSD ``fortune`` program, you used the I{strfile}(8) command\r\nto generate the index. With I{this} fortune program, however, you simply\r\npass a special argument to the ``fortune`` command::\r\n\r\n    fortune -u /path/to/fortunes\r\n\r\nThat command will generate a binary ``/path/to/fortunes.dat`` file that\r\ncontains the index. You should run ``fortune -u`` whenever you change the text\r\nfortune file.\r\n\r\nGenerating a Random Fortune\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nOnce you have an index file, you can generate a random fortune simply by\r\nrunning the ``fortune`` utility with the path to your text fortunes file::\r\n\r\n    fortune /path/to/fortunes\r\n\r\nDifferences\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis version of ``fortune`` does not provide some of the more advanced\r\ncapabilities of the original BSD program. For instance, it lacks:\r\n\r\n- the ability to mark offensive and inoffensive fortunes\r\n- the ability to separate long and short quotes\r\n- the ability to print all fortunes matching a regular expression\r\n\r\nIt does, however, provide the most important function: The ability to display\r\na random quote from a set of quotes.\r\n\r\nLicense and Copyright Info\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2008 Brian M.

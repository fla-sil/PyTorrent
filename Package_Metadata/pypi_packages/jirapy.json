JIRAPy handles the parsing and storing of data so that you can access it with easy to use handlers like `jiraticket.summary` or `jiraticket.tags`, and since it uses native Python data formats and objects, filtering through data is as simple as `for tag in jiraticket.tags`.\n\nIt also includes a few convenience functions to make basic operations in Python more friendly, including the `add_comment()` function which when provided with a valid User/Pass combination can post comments to the remote JIRA instance for that ticket. If you need to comment on a JIRA with Self-Signed SSL, see the section 'My JIRA Uses Self-Signed Certificates'\n\nJIRAPy works with data you already have, either from the APIs or from a WebHook. If you want a complete integration with a running JIRA instance that can pull down data for you, I highly recommend the [PyContribs](https://github.com/pycontribs) Package '[Jira](https://github.com/pycontribs/jira)' which provides a fantastic, complete, drop in solution.\n\n### Why\nI was writing bots to automatically perform actions when a ticket was raised to our board and found that I was recreating the same functions every time I created a new bot. This keeps all the helpers in an easy to import class.\n\n### How Do I Install It\nFor now, you need to clone this Git repo and copy it into your project, but soon you'll be able to run `pip install jirapy` to get it anywhere.\n\n### How Do I Use It\nImport the class(es) you require from the module:\n\n`from jirapy import JiraTicket`\n\nthen create a JIRA object from data returned from the API:\n\n```\nticketdata = get_ticket(\"https://neko-design.jira.com/api/rest/2/issue/jirapy-1\")\njiraticket = JiraTicket(ticketdata)\n```\n\nand now you can read back values from the data:\n\n```\nprint jiraticket.summary\n> Ticket Summary\nprint jiraticket.reporter\n> E. Neko\njiraticket.add_comment(\"Updated System, Please Check\", \"username\", \"password\")\n> 200\n```\n\n### My JIRA Uses Self-Signed Certificates\nI've included the option to turn off SSL Verification for the comments feature. When you create the JiraTicket object, set the optional `verifyssl` parameter to `False`:\n\n```\nticketdata = get_ticket(\"https://neko-design.jira.com/api/rest/2/issue/jirapy-1\")\njiraticket = JiraTicket(ticketdata, False)\n# Or with a Named Parameter\njiraticket = JiraTicket(ticketdata, verifyssl=False)\n```\n\n### Testing\nTo run the tests, launch `tests/ticketTest.py` and it will run though the expected values, producing a report similar to the below:\n\n```\nbash-3.2$ python ticketTest.py\nWARNING:root:Ticket Has no Labels\nWARNING:root:Ticket Has no Components\n [INFO] Starting JIRAPy Tests\n [INFO] ---------------------------------------------\n [INFO] TEST Ticket Summary                   SUCCESS\n [INFO] TEST Ticket Description               SUCCESS\n [INFO] TEST Ticket Key                       SUCCESS\n [INFO] TEST Ticket URL                       SUCCESS\n [INFO] TEST Ticket Reporter                  SUCCESS\n [INFO] TEST Ticket Status                    SUCCESS\n [INFO] TEST Ticket Labels                    SUCCESS\n [INFO] TEST Ticket Labels (Empty)            SUCCESS\n [INFO] TEST Ticket Components                SUCCESS\n [INFO] TEST Ticket Components (Empty)        SUCCESS\n [INFO] ---------------------------------------------\n [INFO] 0 Tests Failed. 10 Passed.\n [INFO] TESTS PASSED.

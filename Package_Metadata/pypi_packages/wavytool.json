You don't need to install, just download and click to execute.\n\nPlease, see Releases page: https://github.com/dpizetta/wavy/releases\n\n## First steps with Wavy\n\nAfter download Wavy you can extract the executable. We suggest you create a folder Wavy to put the executable and the configuration file that will be created, creating a link (icon) to access it from Desktop area.  To run it, just double click.\n\nWhen you run it the first time, it will let you to choose the default folder to place future data files. We suggest that you create a new folder \"Wavy Data\" in Documents or Desktop area for easy access. This procedure will create a file that stays with the executable called \"wavy.config\", to keep that information and future configurations.\n\nThe control of the program is very easy. The top plot show the real time data from input device. Then we can start recording by clicking the Record button.\n\nAlso, if you need, you can pause using the Pause button and start recording again by clicking on Pause once more.\n\nAnd finally, you can stop recording by clicking on Stop button. Now, the buttons to save and export will be enabled.\n\nBy clicking on save button you can save data from recording area to CSV file. Also, you can export an image file using the exporter.\n\n### Note about saving recorded data\n\nIf you zoom in the recording plot, the data saved will represent just the data visible in the window. So make sure you not lost data.\n\n### Some other features on plots\n\nThe plots are provided by PyQtGraph, and if you right click on the plot you will see some nice features including other options to export data. Also you can zoom in and out using the mouse and move it.\n\n### Input device not found\n\nIf the is no input device plugged in (or internal microphone) the program will show a message and exit at this moment, we need future improvement in this way.\n\n## Problems and improvements\n\nIf you find any problems in this program, please let us know using the [Issues System](https://github.com/dpizetta/wavy/issues) provided by GitHub. This is the correct way to keep us alert and how provide information about the development for you. Thanks in advance.\n\n## About\n\nWavy was developed to be a simple software to acquire data from microphone channel, plot and save data.

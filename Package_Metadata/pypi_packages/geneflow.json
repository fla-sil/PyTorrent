The Python pip installer for GeneFlow handles all python dependencies.\n\nAgave is optional.  [Agave](https://tacc-cloud.readthedocs.io/projects/agave/en/latest/index.html) is a Science as a Service platform developed by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).  It provides fine-grained access to storage, authentication, data manipulation, and compute infrastructure and allows you to bring together public, private, and shared high performance computing (HPC), high throughput computing (HTC), Cloud, and Big Data resources under a single, web-friendly REST API.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nUsers with access to the CDC SciComp environment may use the pre-installed GeneFlow and Agave to get started: [Quick Start for CDC Users](#use-geneflow-in-the-cdc-scicomp-environment).\n\nExternal users, or CDC users who need a more customized installation, may refer to the general installation instructions which can be found in the [Additional Documentation](#additional-documentation).\n\n### Use GeneFlow in the CDC SciComp Environment\n\n1. Load the GeneFlow module in the CDC SciComp environment (from either Biolinux or Aspen):\n\n    ```\n    module load geneflow/latest\n    ```\n\n2. Test the installation by running the GeneFlow CLI:\n\n    ```\n    geneflow --help\n    ```\n\n### Install GeneFlow in a Python Virtual Environment\n\nIf you need to install GeneFlow, it is recommended to use a Python3 virtual environment. However, if you have root access and want to install GeneFlow system-wide, you may skip the virtual environment step.\n\n1.  Create and activate a Python3 virtual environment:\n\n    ```\n    python3 -m venv gfpy\n    source gfpy/bin/activate\n    ```\n\n2.  Clone the GeneFlow source repository:\n\n    ```\n    git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/geneflow\n    ```\n\n3.  Install GeneFlow:\n\n    ```\n    pip3 install ./geneflow\n    ```\n\n4.  Test the installation by running the GeneFlow CLI:\n\n    ```\n    geneflow --help\n    ```\n\n## Additional Documentation\n\nAdditional documentation can be found [here](https://geneflow.gitlab.io/). Alternatively, it can be found in the docs folder of this source repository (or by following this link: [Additional Documentation](docs/index.rst)). You can view the index.rst text file, or you can generate the html and pdf documentation with the following commands:\n\n```\ncd ~/geneflow_work\ngit clone https://github.com/CDCgov/geneflow\ncd geneflow/docs\nmake html\nmake latexpdf\n```\n\nThe output html and pdf files should appear in the `_build/html` or `_build/latex` folders. Note that you may need to install some dependencies prior to building the documentation. For example, for Ubuntu systems, run:\n\n```\npip install sphinx\nsudo apt install latexmk texlive texlive-science texlive-formats-extra\n```\n\nNote that sphinx may be installed within a Python virtual environment.\n\n## Development Team and Support\n\nGeneFlow was developed by the GDIT Scientific Computing and Bioinformatics Support (SCBS) team for the Office of Advanced Molecular Detection (OAMD) at the CDC.\n\nFor technical support, please contact oamdsupport@cdc.gov.\n  \n## Public Domain\n\nThis repository constitutes a work of the United States Government and is not\nsubject to domestic copyright protection under 17 USC \u00a7 105.

But don't worry, _solidwebpush_ automatically does this for us when we create a `Pusher` object, which is the one we'll use later to notify our clients:\n        \n        ````python\n        from solidwebpush import Pusher\n        \n        # This will automatically create a Public key for you\n        # and store it in a .PEM file. Note: the next time the \n        # key won't be created and the value stored in the .PEM\n        # file will be used instead.\n        pusher = Pusher()\n        # And then, let's get our Public Key ...\n        print pusher.getUrlB64PublicKey() #... as a UrlSafe-Base64-encoded string\n        ````\n        \n          \n        Copy this string and paste it into the _**main.js**_ file:\n        ````javascript\n        //main.js (line 24)\n        const applicationServerPublicKey = '<Your Public Key>';\n        ````\n        \n        \n        And finally, suppouse one of our clients, after registering and subscribing its serviceWorker(_sw.js_), has sent us the following subscription object:\n        \n        ````text\n        {\"endpoint\":\"https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send/cOZ80twUe2I:APA91bFWFWTIJzD3B7YHCBKzpSD_KfFe5a_XOo0gZDhGX1JYBwtY6UtNVyCXVt0Z2Fd4iOb9SLSOo1WGBclMaWoDFYMcmh7EhlXd-OJXpWK-gAph0cO1OQPrIqCQ_W0C-XJ0fUsqpXU_\",\"keys\":{\"p256dh\":\"BMb7ie9TlYqIUcA52gQBXqKFleWoqHnXPOkvlgKGd2Mw4nnEMhII7VwB41xp0T70VrZb0w4LoP4Cn7ccD0zEtmA=\",\"auth\":\"EKID_2FLZ4uJg6zSHB4psA==\"}}\n        ````\n        \n        And we want to send him a \"Hello World\" notification, this could be easily done as follows:\n        \n        ````python\n        from solidwebpush import Pusher\n        \n        subscription = '{\"endpoint\":\"https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send/cOZ80twUe2I:APA91bFWFWTIJzD3B7YHCBKzpSD_KfFe5a_XOo0gZDhGX1JYBwtY6UtNVyCXVt0Z2Fd4iOb9SLSOo1WGBclMaWoDFYMcmh7EhlXd-OJXpWK-gAph0cO1OQPrIqCQ_W0C-XJ0fUsqpXU_\",\"keys\":{\"p256dh\":\"BMb7ie9TlYqIUcA52gQBXqKFleWoqHnXPOkvlgKGd2Mw4nnEMhII7VwB41xp0T70VrZb0w4LoP4Cn7ccD0zEtmA=\",\"auth\":\"EKID_2FLZ4uJg6zSHB4psA==\"}}'\n        \n        pusher = Pusher()\n        pusher.sendNotification(subscription, \"Hello World\")\n        \n        ````\n        cool, uh?\n        \n        \n        **Note:** these and more [examples](https://github.com/sergioburdisso/solidwebpush/tree/master/examples) can be found inside the _\"examples\"_ folder.\n        \n        \n        \n        ---\n        ## 4. Good to know...\n        \n        In the \"real world\", subscription objects are going to be sent to our server via HTTP requests (probably using AJAX), and they will be stored along with the user session ID so that, later, when we need to notify a client, we do so by his session id (and not his subscription object). Fortunately, _solidwebpush_ also does this for us, as shown in the following example:\n        \n        ````python\n        # SERVER CODE\n        ...\n        from solidwebpush import Pusher\n        ...\n        \n        pusher = Pusher()\n        \n        #Note: assuming messages are being sent via HTTP POST\n        #      and the session token (session_id)  is  stored\n        #      as a cookie in the client's device.\n        ... \n        elif POST[\"action\"] == \"subscribe\":\n            pusher.newSubscription(\n                COOKIE[\"session_id\"],\n                POST[\"subscription\"]\n            )\n        elif POST[\"action\"] == \"unsubscribe\":\n            pusher.removeSubscription(\n                COOKIE[\"session_id\"]\n            )\n        ...\n        \n        # it's worth noting that you can also\n        # send a dict object instead of a string.\n        # solidwebpush will convert it into a \n        # JSON string before pushing the notification.\n        msg = {\n            \"title\": \"Notification Title\",\n            \"body\": \"Hello World\"\n        }\n        #notifying user X\n        pusher.notify(user_X_session_id, msg)\n        \n        #or if you want to,\n        #notify all users\n        pusher.notifyAll(msg)\n        \n        ...\n        ````\n        When `Pusher`'s `newSubscription` is called for the very first time, a sqlite-database file will be automatically generated ('subscriptors.db' by default) to store all these subscriptions for us. Later, when we use a method like `notifyAll` (or `notify`), _solidwebpush_ will push the notifications using the information that is stored there.\n        \n        Finally, I highly recommend you to read the [documentation](http://pythonhosted.org/solidwebpush/) for a \"more in depth\" understanding of the package. For instance, `newSubscription` and `notifyAll` can receive an [optional] parameter to specify a group ID. As shown below:\n        \n        ````python\n        ...\n        #new subscription for <session_id>, which belongs to \"group 13\"\n        pusher.newSubscription(session_id, subscription, 13)\n        \n        ...\n        #notifay all members of \"group 13\"\n        pusher.notifyAll(\"Hello World\", 13)\n        ...\n        ````\n        \n        Additionally every method that lets you push notifications (`sendNotification`, `sendNotificationToAll`, `notify`, `notifyAll`) has an [optional] `nonblocking` parameter, in case you want to use a non-blocking version of it. In which case the `wait` method can be called every time you need your program to block until all the messages are sent. For example:\n        \n        ````python\n        subscriptions = [ ... ]\n        ...\n        pusher.sendNotificationToAll(subscriptions, \"Hello World\", nonblocking=True)\n        # lets continue doing useful things for the user\n        ...\n        \n        #and in case we need to wait for those messages to be sent\n        pusher.wait()\n        ````\n        \n        Why could be a non-blocking version desirable? When blocking mode is used (the default), the server's \"main loop\" blocks every time it sends notifications and in some cases that is not desirable \u2014for instance, if it negatively affects the overall system response time.\nKeywords: web push notifications,notifications,web notifications,push,webpush,raspberry pi\nPlatform: UNKNOWN\nClassifier: Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP\nClassifier: Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: PyPy\nClassifier: Programming Language :: Python\nClassifier: Programming Language :: Python :: 2\nClassifier: Programming Language :: Python :: 3\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": "https://pythonhosted.org/solidwebpush/", "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "solidwebpush", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/solidwebpush/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/solidwebpush/", "project_urls": null, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/solidwebpush/1.2.3/", "requires_dist": ["future", "py-vapid (==0.7.1)", "http-ece (==0.7.0)", "pyelliptic (==1.5.7)", "requests (==2.20.0)"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "", "version": "1.2.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            This package lets your server send Web Push Notifications to your clients.<br>NOTE: No particular web framework are required (e.g. Django, Flask, Pyramid,<br>etc.), since it was originally designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with no web<br>server installed (only a bare Python program listening on a port for HTTP<br>requests).<br><br>Home-page: https://github.com/sergioburdisso/solidwebpush<br>Author: Sergio Burdisso<br>Author-email: sergio.burdisso@gmail.com<br>License: MIT<br>Download-URL: https://github.com/sergioburdisso/solidwebpush/tarball/v1.2.3<br>Description: <br>        # Solid Web Push<br>        <br>        This package lets your server send Web Push Notifications to your clients.<br>        NOTE: **No** particular Web framework are required (e.g. Django, Flask, Pyramid, etc.), since<br>        it was originally designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with no web server installed (<br>        only a bare Python script listening on a port for HTTP requests).<br>        <br>        ---<br>        ## 1.

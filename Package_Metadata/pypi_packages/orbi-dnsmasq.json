I usually test \nthis step out with [Speedtest by Ookla](https://www.speedtest.net/), but you can use whichever one you want. _Note: \nNot every ad will be blocked, youtube ads still seem to be showing up for example. Nevertheless, a lot of dangerous sites and ads won't\n be shown._\n\nAlso, **don't worry if you end up running this command twice**. I made sure it does not fail if the config was already in place.\n\n#### Auto turn on telnet before command, and turn it off after\n\nI don't like leaving my telnet port open when I'm not using it, so I built in feature with selenium to toggle this option \non before running configs on the Orbi, and turning it off afterwards. If you want to use this feature, you'll first need to \n[download one of the selenium webdrivers](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#introduction).\nAny will do, just make sure you also have that browser installed on your system.\n\nAfter that, run:\n\n```\norbi-dnsmasq -t -w path/to/downloaded/webdriver\n```\n\nYou can avoid the `-w` flag if you put the downloaded webdriver in your PATH.\n\n## Possible things to add:\n\n- Read password from ENV var, don't ask it if already found.\n- Flag option to set username to connect with, use admin as default (is this even necessary?).\n- Create Telnet object with telnet_write methods, cleaning up the code.\n- Flag option to indicate how much to wait for web elements to appear, and to indicate polling rate.\n- Use polling rate and selenium with expected condition wait.\n- Remove selenium's send keys TODO and `keyboard` dependency when [this issue is fixed](https://github.com/w3c/webdriver/issues/385).\n- Unit testing? (does it even makes sense? All telnet communications would need to be mocked)\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n- This project wouldn't have been possible without [hackingthenetgearorbi](https://hackingthenetgearorbi.wordpress.com/), \nso please show them some love!\n- Also check out [hackingthenetgearorbi creator's github](https://github.com/tumescentrubor/Orbi-s-Non-Sufficit). \nThey are currently doing some really cool stuff with persistent modifications on the Orbi!\n- Thanks [someonewhocares' Dan Pollock](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/) for the magnificent hosts file.

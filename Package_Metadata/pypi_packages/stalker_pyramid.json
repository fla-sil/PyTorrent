The only left issue\r\n    is the end date value is not properly shown in the gannt view.\r\n  * Updated the jQueryGannt css's to work with Stalker and Dojo.\r\n  * Colorized the Sunday column in suitable zoom levels. In upcoming releases\r\n    it will use the stalker.models.studio.Studio.working_hours attribute to\r\n    determine if the day/hour is an off day/hour.\r\n  * Disabled editing of date fields.\r\n  * Disabled undo/redo queue for performance test.\r\n  * Fixed vertical overflow in gantt chart.\r\n  * It is now possible to not to align a tasks start to its dependent tasks\r\n    end.\r\n  * jQueryGantt is now using the Task ids coming from Stalker instead of the\r\n    ridiculous rowId.\r\n  * Fixed a lot of issues related with the new data structure, it seems\r\n    everything is working properly right now.\r\n  * Parent Tasks displayed differently than the leaf tasks (on paar with the\r\n    other gantt charts).\r\n  * Gantt chart in User Detail page is now showing the parent tasks of the\r\n    tasks of the user.\r\n  * Now there are two different context menus for container/parent tasks and\r\n    leaf tasks.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://code.google.com/p/stalker_pyramid/", "keywords": "web,wsgi,bfg,pylons,pyramid,production,asset,management,vfx,animation,houdini,nuke,fusion,xsi,blender,vue", "license": "UNKNOWN", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "stalker_pyramid", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/stalker_pyramid/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/stalker_pyramid/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://code.google.com/p/stalker_pyramid/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/stalker_pyramid/0.1.0.b1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Stalker (ProdAM) Based Web App", "version": "0.1.0.b1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"about\">\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>Stalker is an Open Source Production Asset Management (ProdAM) System designed\nspecifically for Animation and VFX Studios but can be used for any kind of\nprojects.

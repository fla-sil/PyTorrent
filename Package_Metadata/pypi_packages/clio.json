This requirement is not a core requirement\nof Clio however, and the main Clio codebase does not depend on it, so\nit is expected to go away.\n\nCHANGES\n*******\n\n0.7 (2010-05-14)\n================\n\n- Changed the database schema: two new fields were added\n  (``changed_timestamp`` and ``created_userid``).  Throw away the\n  ``clio_tests`` database and recreate it again to run the tests. You\n  will have to upgrade your existing databases as well.\n \n- When a new version is created of an existing object, the\n  ``changed_userid`` will be copied over from the last version. If a\n  new object is created from scratch, it will be the\n  ``created_userid``. ``changed_timestamp`` is treated the same. This\n  makes it possible to detect changes between versions by comparing\n  the timestamps.\n\n- Update documentation to include integer status codes as they appear\n  in the database.\n\n- Updated documentation to include changed information about the\n  timestamps were recorded (as of 0.6), as well as the new timestamp.\n\n0.6.4 (2010-02-17)\n==================\n\n- Provide an 'update' method for Sequence, so we can set the sequence\n  value. This can be useful in code that converts old databases that\n  already define the equivalent of 'code'.\n\n0.6.3 (2010-02-12)\n==================\n\n- Another bugfix with revert logic. Allow reverting already published\n  objects, as they may have relations that need to be reverted. Don't\n  raise an error when trying to revert an archived object, instead\n  just don't do anything.\n\n0.6.2 (2010-02-12)\n==================\n\n- Fixed a bug in revert logic. Reversion of edited records should now\n  work better when there are relations.\n\n0.6.1 (2010-02-10)\n==================\n\n- Added ``_actual`` property which is like _editable, except that deleted\n  items are not part of it.\n\n- Also added is_actual method.\n\n0.6 (2010-02-10)\n================\n\n- userid tracking for workflow events.\n\n- change the way timestamps are recorded so that queries for older\n  published items can more easily be constructed. This breaks existing\n  databases. We assume nobody but the author is using Clio yet.\n\n- stop using pysqlite in the tests; the tests now depend on MySQL.\n\n- Introduce ACTUAL_STATUSES. This is what is present in the edit UI,\n  except those things that were deleted. This can be handy in queries.\n\n0.5 (2009-11-16)\n================\n\n- Initial public release.\n\n\nDownload\n********", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": "https://pythonhosted.org/clio/", "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "UNKNOWN", "keywords": "history workflow sqlalchemy", "license": "ZPL", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "clio", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/clio/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/clio/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "UNKNOWN"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/clio/0.7/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A publication/history system for SQLAlchemy.", "version": "0.7", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"clio\">\n<h2>Clio</h2>\n<p>Clio is a library based on SQLAlchemy that can be used to add a\npublication workflow and archiving system to a database.</p>\n<p>The documentation is available at <a href=\"http://packages.python.org/clio/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://packages.python.org/clio/</a></p>\n<p>Note that currently MySQL is a requirement (for running the tests, and\nfor the sequence support).

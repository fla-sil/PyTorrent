The main class,\n`djcastor.storage.CAStorage`, is a type of `FileSystemStorage` which saves files\nunder their SHA-1 digest.\n\n*   No matter how many times the same file is uploaded, it will only ever be\n    stored once, thus eliminating redundancy.\n\n*   Filenames are pseudorandom and made up only of hexadecimal characters, so\n    you don\u2019t have to worry about filename collisions or sanitization.\n\n*   `django-castor` shards files in the uploads directory based on their\n    digests; this prevents filesystem issues when too many files are in a single\n    directory.\n\nFor more information on the CAS concept, see the [wikipedia page][].\n\n  [wikipedia page]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage\n\n\n## Installation\n\n    pip install django-castor  # or\n    easy_install django-castor\n\n\n## Usage\n\nBasic usage is as follows:\n\n    from django.db import models\n    from djcastor import CAStorage\n\n    class MyModel(models.Model):\n        ...\n        uploaded_file = models.FileField(storage=CAStorage(),\n                                         upload_to='uploads')\n\nAt the moment, Django requires a non-empty value for the `upload_to` parameter.\nNote that `CAStorage` will **not** use this value; if you need to customize the\ndestination for uploaded files, use the `location` parameter (see below).\n\nFor extended usage, there are several options you can pass to the `CAStorage`\nconstructor. The first two are inherited from the built-in `FileSystemStorage`:\n\n*   `location`: The absolute path to the directory that will hold uploaded\n    files. If omitted, this will be set to the value of the `MEDIA_ROOT`\n    setting.\n\n*   `base_url`: The URL that serves the files stored at this location. If\n    omitted, this will be set to the value of the `MEDIA_URL` setting.\n\n`CAStorage` also adds two custom options:\n\n*   `keep_extension` (default `True`): Preserve the extension on uploaded files.\n    This allows the webserver to guess their `Content-Type`.\n\n*   `sharding` (default `(2, 2)`): The width and depth to use when sharding\n    digests, expressed as a two-tuple. The following examples show how these\n    parameters affect the sharding:\n\n        >>> digest = '1f09d30c707d53f3d16c530dd73d70a6ce7596a9'\n\n        >>> print shard(digest, width=2, depth=2)\n        1f/09/1f09d30c707d53f3d16c530dd73d70a6ce7596a9\n\n        >>> print shard(digest, width=2, depth=3)\n        1f/09/d3/1f09d30c707d53f3d16c530dd73d70a6ce7596a9\n\n        >>> print shard(digest, width=3, depth=2)\n        1f0/9d3/1f09d30c707d53f3d16c530dd73d70a6ce7596a9\n\n\n## Caveats\n\nThe first small caveat is that content-addressable storage is not suited to\nrapidly-changing content. If your website modifies the contents of file fields\non a regular basis, it might be a better idea to use a UUID-based storage\nbackend for those fields.\n\nThe second, more important caveat with this approach is that if the parent model\nof a file is deleted, the file will remain on disk. Because individual files may\nbe referred to by more than one model, and `django-castor` has no awareness of\nthese references, it leaves file deletion up to the developer.\n\nFor the most part, you can get away without deleting uploads. In fact,\ncontent-addressable storage is often used for long-term archival systems, where\nfiles are immutable and must be kept for future auditing (usually for compliance\nwith government regulations).\n\nIf disk space is at a premium and you need to delete uploads, there are two\napproaches you might want to take:\n\n*   Garbage collection: write a script that walks through the list of uploaded\n    files and checks references to each one. If no references are found, delete\n    the file.\n\n*   Reference counting: denormalize the `FileField` into a separate model, and\n    keep a count of all the models pointing to it. Once this count reaches zero,\n    delete the file from the filesystem.\n\n\n## (Un)license\n\nThis is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\n\nAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute this\nsoftware, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose,\ncommercial or non-commercial, and by any means.\n\nIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors of this\nsoftware dedicate any and all copyright interest in the software to the public\ndomain.

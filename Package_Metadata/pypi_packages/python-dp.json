Other functions will be released in further release.\n\nTo install the package:\n`pip install python-dp`\n\n```\nimport pydp as dp # imports the DP library\n\n# To calculate the Bounded Mean\n# epsilon is a number between 0 and 1 denoting privacy threshold\n# It measures the acceptable loss of privacy (with 0 meaning no loss is acceptable)\n# If both the lower and upper bounds are specified, \n# x = dp.BoundedMean(epsilon: double, lower: int, upper: int)\nx = dp.BoundedMean(0.6, 1, 10)\n\n# If lower and upper bounds are not specified, \n# DP library automtaically calculates these bounds\n# x = dp.BoundedMean(epsilon: double)\nx = dp.BoundedMean(0.6)\n\n# To get the result\n# Currently supported data types are integer and float. Future versions will support additional data types\n# Refer to examples/carrots.py for an example\nx.result(input_data: list)\n\n```\n\nKnown issue: If the privacy budget (epsilon is too less), we get a StatusOR error in the command line.

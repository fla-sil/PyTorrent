It can be used to evaluate feature importance on a given dataset that is not necessarily from the same distribution as the training set, so the feature importances of a trained model can be recalculated for a new test dataset, and/or evaluation metric. This might be useful to test sensitivity to systematic shifts (domain adaptation), or just the impact of features for particular subsets of the dataset (samples with 1 jet, 2 jets, samples with a score > 0.6, signal at mass 700 GeV, 800 GeV, etc).

This module comes complete with protocol handler, SSL/TLS support, and event functions to handle all the data that would be sent back and forth for users to see/interact with.\n\nI built this because there was no real working implementation of the ADC protocol for Python yet, the closest being python-adc. Which isn't finished and had absolutely no bearing on this project, this module is tested and working for all basic functions of the ADC protocol.\n\nThe few things this module does not yet have (planned for later releases) is Searching, Client-To-Client Connections and File Downloads.\n\nThanks To\n=========\n\nA very special thanks goes out to Orochi/Crispy for his help on understanding a few things that, without them, this library would not work at all, so thanks again my friend.\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nFirst things first, because this requires the tiger tree hash that ADC uses for basically everything, you need to install libmhash-dev on linux. I have yet to test this on Windows or Mac. If on Ubuntu/Debian based linux the install in terminal would be like this::\n\n    sudo apt-get install libmhash-dev python-dev\n\nNow, install python-mhash separately, because it no longer works with pip::\n\n    wget http://labix.org/download/python-mhash/python-mhash-1.4.tar.gz\n    tar -xzvf python-mhash-1.4.tar.gz\n    cd python-mhash-1.4\n    sudo python setup.py install\n\nOnce thats done, then use pip to install pyadc:: \n\n    sudo pip install pyadc\n\nIn case for some reason pip does not install the proper dependencies, they are as follows::\n\n    tiger 0.3 - sudo pip install tiger\n    enum34 1.0 - sudo pip install enum34\n\nExamples\n========\n\nAn example of how to use the module is below::\n\t\n    #!/usr/bin/env python\n\t\n    from pyadc.client import Clients\n    \n    def main():\n        clientlist = Clients() # Create new instance of Client\n        clientlist.makeclient(\"adcs://somehub.com:5000\", \"username\", \"somepass\", \"No files to share\", events)\n\t\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n\nEvent Functions\n---------------\n\nThere are now two ways to interface event functions with the library, the original event dictionary as has been since the beginning of this library. It is shown below::\n\n    events = {\n    'onconnected': onconnected, # parameter: hubaddress(string)\n    'onconnecting': onconnecting, # parameter: hubaddress(string)\n    'ondisconnected': ondisconnected, # parameter: hubaddress(string)\n    'oniprecvd': oniprecvd, # parameters: hubaddress(string), sessionid(string), ip(string)\n    'onjoin': onjoin, # parameters: hubaddress(string) and username(string)\n    'onprivatemessage': onprivatemessage, # parameters: hubaddress(string), user(object), message(string)\n    'onprivateemote': onprivateemote, # parameters: hubaddress(string), user(object), message(string)\n    'onpublicmessage': onpublicmessage, # parameters: hubaddress(string), user(object), message(string)\n    'onpublicemote': onpublicemote, # parameters: hubaddress(string), user(object), message(string)\n    'onpart': onpart, # parameters: hubaddress(string), username(string)\n    'onredirect': onredirect, # parameters: new hubaddress(string)\n    'onpassword': onpassword, # parameters: hubaddress(string)\n    'onstatusmessage': onstatusmessage, # parameters: hubaddress(string), status code(integer), status message(string)\n    'onbadpass': onbadpass, # parameters: hubaddress(string)\n    'ontopic': ontopic, # parameters: hubaddress(string), topic(string)\n    'onhubname': onhubname # parameters: hubaddress(string), hubname(string)\n    }\n    cl.events = events\n\nAll the parameters listed beside each event in the comments, is the order in which the library will send them out. e.g.::\n\n    def onprivatemessage(hubaddress, user, message):\n\nNow there is a class supported version, instead of a dictionary you can simply pass your own class handler directly to the library, an example of how to do this is below. All function names must match the event example, custom names are not yet supported for class handlers.::\n\n    class ADCHandler:\n        \n        def __init__(self, example):\n            self.examplevar = example\n        \n        def onconnected(self, hubaddress):\n            #do stuff here...\n    \n    def main():\n        clientlist = Clients()\n        clientlist.makeclient(\"adcs://somehub.com:5000\", \"username\", \"somepass\", \"No files to share\", ADCHandler(examplevar))\n\nClients Class (Main Class)\n--------------------------\n\nThe Clients class is used for multi-hub connections, it merely makes it so you can simply create a client through a single function call, rather then a group of settings, it does it all for you, this will still work with a single connection for those not wanting to type everything out. Below you will find the properties of the Clients class::\n\n    clients.getclientbyaddress(hubaddress) # Retrieves the Client class of hubaddress, same as given to event functions\n    clients.getaddressfromname(hubname) # Retreives the hubaddress from the given hub name sent by the hub.\n    clients.makeclient(address, username, password, description, events=None, owner=\"\", pid=\"\") Creates and returns new Client object, also issues connect().\n\nClient Class\n------------\n\nThe Client class is the class that every other class is tied into and is your main way of accessing all the information contained in the various classes, below are the variables and functions used in this class::\n\n    client.clientinfo # variable to access the ClientInfo Class [Object]\n    client.hubinfo # variable to access the HubInfo Class[Object]\n    client.nicklist # Variable to access the NickList class and the findbyusername function [Object]\n    client.sid # The Client's Session ID given by the hub upon connecting [String]\n    client.isconnected # Variable to check if the client is connected or not [Boolean]\n    client.debug # Variable to turn on/off the debug feature, shows all raw data going in and out of the library, default is False [Boolean]\n    client.events # Dictionary of events, as described above for the library to call at certain points. [Dictionary]\n    client.connect() # Start connection function\n    client.disconnect() # Immediately close connection\n    client.sendmainchatmessage(message, emote=False) # Send a message to the main public chat, emote defaults to false, set to true to send as /me command\n    client.sendprivatemessagebyclass(user, message, emote=False) # Send a private message to user, this uses the user object and not a string username, emote defaults to false, set to true to send as /me command\n    client.sendprivatemessage(username, message, emote=False) # Send private message to username given, this uses the string username instead of the user object, emote defaults to false, set to true to send as /me command\n    client.sendprivatemainchatmessagebyclass(user, message) # Send a mainchat message to a specific user (only seen by that user) using the user object\n    client.sendprivatemainchatmessage(username, message) # Send a mainchat message to a specific user (only seen by that user) using the string username\n    \n\nUser Class\n-----------\n\nThe library tracks all users in the hub using the user class, there are various ways to get the user class. The events onprivatemessage and onpublicmessage include the user object. If you require the user object and have only been given the username by the library simply do this::\n\n    user = cl.nicklist.findbyusername(username)\n\nIf nothing is found it will return False, if only one matching it is found, it will return a single User object. If there are more then one found it will return a list of user objects.\n\nThe following are the variables you can find in the User object::\n\n    user.ip # IPv4 address (Currently IPv6 is not supported) [String]\n    user.port # IPv4 Port [Integer]\n    user.sharesize # Share Size in bytes [Integer]\n    user.sharedfiles # Number of Shared Files [Integer]\n    user.tag # Client Identification\n    user.maxuploadspeed # Maximum Uplod Speed in bits/sec [Integer]\n    user.openslots # Number of Open slots user has [Integer]\n    user.autoslots # Automatic slot allocator speed limit in bytes/sec [Integer]\n    user.maxopenslots # Maximum number of slots open in automatic slot manager mode [Integer]\n    user.email # User's email [String]\n    user.username # Username of user, only used for display purposes [String]\n    user.description # User's description [String]\n    user.hubsnormal # Number of hubs user is unregistered in [Integer]\n    user.hubsreg # Number of hubs user is registered in [Integer]\n    user.hubsop # Number of hubs user is op in [Integer]\n    user.hubstatus # Protocol value of what users permissions are [Integer] see: http://adc.sourceforge.net/ADC.html#_inf (CT field) for more details\n    user.sid # Session ID given to user from hub [String]\n    user.cid # Client ID generated from Private ID of client [String]\n    user.token # Token for Client to Client connections (Not yet supported) [String] \n    user.isoperator #  Variable if user is an operator in the hub or not [Boolean]\n    user.ishidden # Variable is user is hidden in hub [Boolean]\n    user.isaway # Variable if user is st to away [Boolean]\n    user.isbot # Variable if user is a bot or not [Boolean]\n    user.supportlist # List of protocols supported by client. [List]\n    user.downloadlist # List of downloads (Currently not supported) [List]\n\nHubInfo Class\n-------------\n\nThe HubInfo class is a very small class that simply stores some information the hub sends, below is what it contains::\n\n    hubinfo.hubsupports # List of protocols that the hub supports [List]\n    hubinfo.hubname # Name of the hub [String]\n    hubinfo.topic # Topic of the hub [String]\n    hubinfo.hubversion # Version of the hub [String]\n    hubinfo.lastmessage # Last message sent by the hub [String]\n\nClientInfo Class\n----------------\n\nThe ClientInfo class is a support class that is responsible for generating PID's and CID's according to ADC protocol standards, and also looking up the WAN IP of the computer the script is running on. It is also responsible for holding some information, which can be found below::\n\n    clientinfo.hostname # The Hostname of the hub without scheme or port number [String]\n    clientinfo.do_ssl # Variable on whether or not the address given to the hubaddress function requires ssl/tls [Boolean]\n    clientinfo.port # port given to the hubaddress function [Integer]\n    clientinfo.username # Username to connect with [String]\n    clientinfo.password # Password to send upon connecting [String]\n    clientinfo.description # Description to set for user connecting [String]\n    clientinfo.email # Email of user\n    clientinfo.reconnectondisconnect # If disconnected reconnect [Boolean]\n    clientinfo.share # Share size in bytes (default is clientinfo.ShareSize.Empty) [Integer]\n    clientinfo.followredirects # Follow redirects if any are given to the library [Boolean]\n    clientinfo.respondtorevconnecttome # Respond to Reverse Connect To Me's, always false, no support for this option yet [Boolean]\n    clientinfo.clientport # To be used later for client-to-client connections, currently defaults to 1337 [Integer]\n    clientinfo.client_pid # Private ID for client [String]\n    clientinfo.client_cid # Client ID for client [String]\n    clientinfo.hubaddress() # Function to either get or set the Hub Address to connect to. e.g. addy = clientinfo.hubaddress() or clientinfo.hubaddress(\"adcs://somehub.com:500\")", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyADC/", "keywords": null, "license": "LICENSE.txt", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "pyADC", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyADC/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyADC/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyADC/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyADC/0.1.7/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Python implementation of the ADC(S) Protocol for Direct Connect.", "version": "0.1.7", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>pyADC is an implementation of the Advanced Direct Connect (ADC) protocol for use on ADC-supported Direct Connect hubs.

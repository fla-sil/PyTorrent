Provide the necessary permissions for the SGM executable located in the root directory.    \nFor now SGM is only compatible with the zsnes emulator. So be sure to download it with:  \n\n(ubuntu)\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install zsnes\n```\n### Python\nFor a more versatile version, use SMG direct from python.  \nThis version has not been tested yet. But most likely works on windows and mac.  \nMake sure you have python 3.6 installed with \"PyQt5\" and \"requests\" libraries on your computer.  \nUnzip the downloaded project from the [github](https://github.com/allanvobraun/SnesGameManager) page. \n Then run main.py with:\n\n```bash\npython3.6 main.py\n```\n\n## Usage\nWhen running the program this will be the main screen.  \nClick \"File\" and then \"Open roms folder\" to add your roms folder.  \n\n![passo1](https://i.imgur.com/697bgOA.png)\n\n\nA window should open as the file browser, select the desired folder and click \"open\".  \n\n![passo2](https://i.imgur.com/934gK4T.png)\n\n\nAfter this the files will be loaded and organized.  \nTo download the game covers, click on \"Functions\" and then \"Download game covers\".  \n\n![passo3](https://i.imgur.com/qHYPUxB.png)\n\n\nThe download will start, after its completion close the dialog box.  \nNote that sometimes a cover download can fail. \nThis is probably due to the ROM file name.   \nTry to modify it to be compatible with the original name of the game in capitalized letters.    \n\n![passo4](https://i.imgur.com/ZZfPKQk.png)\n\n\nTo play the game, simply select it and hit the Play button. Your emulator should take care of the rest.\n\n## Future additions\nIn future versions SGM will bring features like:\n* Support for Windows and Mac OS.\n* Support for other emulators like higan and snes9x.\n* Function for configuring controls and shortcuts.\n* Support for Japanese game covers.\n* Carousel display function.\n* Function to better configure the game list.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe project is written in python 3.6, using the UI library PYQT5.  \nThe UI was built entirely using the QT designer.  \nIn order to \"compile\" the project in executable form, the [pyinstaler](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) was used.  \nIn order to download the images, the python requests library was used.    \nAll images are downloaded from this amazing [repository](https://github.com/ZeroSuf3r/nintendo-games-icons).  \nThe code is all appropriate for the English language, although the comments are written in pt-br.\n This should not be a big obstacle, but I will try to translate that part into the future.\n\n\n\n\n## Contributing\nPull requests are welcome. For big changes, please open a issue to discuss the change.  \nFor direct contact, send me an e-mail: allanvobraun@gmail.com\n## License\nFree Software.  \n[MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/allanvobraun/SnesGameManager", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "SnesGameManager", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/SnesGameManager/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/SnesGameManager/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/allanvobraun/SnesGameManager"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/SnesGameManager/1.0.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Pyqt tool to organize snes roms", "version": "1.0.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h2><img height=\"20px\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/e2fcfd7d2769393a0603d6c813b54a95e4bb3797/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f31756267666d432e706e67\"><a href=\"README-pt-br.md\" rel=\"nofollow\"> \u2013 Leia em portugu\u00eas!</a><br>\n<img height=\"20px\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/18d7993eafa52378a2d1e330d440e8e18b09c125/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f5572704f424f722e706e67\"><a href=\"README.md\" rel=\"nofollow\"> \u2013 Read in English!</a></h2>\n<h1>Snes Game Manager</h1>\n<p>SGM is an application that aims to organize roms of your Super Nintendo emulator in a visual, simple and practical way.<br>\nSome of the application's functions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detect rom files and arrange them in a ordered list.</li>\n<li>Download game covers automatically, based on the name of the game.</li>\n<li>Run the rom on your favorite emulator.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<h3>Executable</h3>\n<p>For now, the executable version of SGM is only compatible with linux.<br>\nAvailable for download <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fCHrqvh0bogIbvInQLTkmPVjFTGgjGNI/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.<br>\nAfter unpacking the file.

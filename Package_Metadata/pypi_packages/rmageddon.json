Create project from [template](doc/Rmageddon-cookiecutter.md) \n        2. [Resolve](doc/Rmageddon.md) conda packages from R `sessionInfo` \n        3. [Lint](doc/Rmageddon.md) the project against the guidelines\n        \n        \n        ## Motivation\n        \n        Performing a reproducible analysis with R and share the environment status of an R installation with the \n        necessary packages and all that with the correct version is a very challenging task.\n        \n        In order to face this issue, under the umbrella of better reproducibility of computational results, we created\n        **Rmageddon**, a small command-line tool, that assists in the build of Docker container with specified version of R and\n        a dedicated, version-defined package installation. Moreover, Rmageddon provides cookiecutter templates for the easy creation of docker environments for your R analysis.\n        \n        The container collection is hosted on a different GitHub repository: [R-container-lib](https://github.com/qbicsoftware/r-container-lib). All containers there passed the linting and have been build with Rmageddon.\n        \n        ## Usage\n        \n        The complete workflow for the creation of a new container for your R-analysis is depicted in the following image: \n            \n        ![Rmageddon_workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21954664/53096328-2acf5580-351f-11e9-898a-1b8ce790afee.png)\n        \n        This README will guide you through the complete process of starting with the sessioninfo of your R-analysis and finally sharing your docker powered R-environment on our [R-container-lib](https://github.com/qbicsoftware/r-container-lib).\n        \n        1. Create a sessioninfo from your R-analysis. The official R-documentation explains this process well: [Sessioninfo](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.5.2/topics/sessionInfo).\n        2. Install Rmageddon. This is explained in the documentation for Rmageddon: [Rmageddon documentation](doc/Rmageddon.md)\n        3. Create a docker environment using the cookiecutter template. This process is described in the documentation for the [Rmageddon-cookiecutter](doc/Rmageddon-cookiecutter.md)\n        4. Run Rmageddon **build** on your sessioninfo. This is again explained in the documentation for Rmageddon: [Rmageddon documentation](doc/Rmageddon.md), especially in the **subcommand build** section.\n        5. Ensure that your environment.yml file is now or still in your R-container which you created in step 3\n        6. Add your R-scripts that you used for your analysis to your just created R-container \n        7. Validate your just created R-container: Run Rmageddon **lint** on it. Please refer to the documentation for Rmageddon: [Rmageddon documentation](doc/Rmageddon.md), especially in the **subcommand lint** section.\n        8. If validation was successful your R-container is now ready to be added to our R-container library. Please refer to the final documentation of the [R-container-lib](https://github.com/qbicsoftware/r-container-lib).\n        9.

It provides a consistent\nhigh-level interface for configuring and launching parallel computations\nacross heterogenous resources. ``pathos`` provides configurable launchers for\nparallel and distributed computing, where each launcher contains the\nsyntactic logic to configure and launch jobs in an execution environment.\nExamples of launchers that plug into ``pathos`` are: a queue-less MPI-based\nlauncher (in ``pyina``), a ssh-based launcher (in ``pathos``), and a multi-process\nlauncher (in ``multiprocess``).\n\n``pathos`` provides a consistent interface for parallel and/or distributed\nversions of ``map`` and ``apply`` for each launcher, thus lowering the barrier\nfor users to extend their code to parallel and/or distributed resources.\nThe guiding design principle behind ``pathos`` is that ``map`` and ``apply``\nshould be drop-in replacements in otherwise serial code, and thus switching\nto one or more of the ``pathos`` launchers is all that is needed to enable\ncode to leverage the selected parallel or distributed computing resource.\nThis not only greatly reduces the time to convert a code to parallel, but it\nalso enables a single code-base to be maintained instead of requiring\nparallel, serial, and distributed versions of a code. ``pathos`` maps can be\nnested, thus hierarchical heterogenous computing is possible by merely\nselecting the desired hierarchy of ``map`` and ``pipe`` (``apply``) objects.\n\nThe ``pathos`` framework is composed of several interoperating packages:\n\n    - ``dill``: a utility to serialize all of python\n    - ``pox``: utilities for filesystem exploration and automated builds\n    - ``klepto``: persistent caching to memory, disk, or database\n    - ``multiprocess``: better multiprocessing and multithreading in python\n    - ``ppft``: distributed and parallel python\n    - ``pyina``: MPI parallel ``map`` and cluster scheduling\n    - ``pathos``: graph management and execution in heterogenous computing\n\n\nAbout Pathos\n============\n\nThe ``pathos`` package provides a few basic tools to make parallel and\ndistributed computing more accessible to the end user. The goal of ``pathos``\nis to enable the user to extend their own code to parallel and distributed\ncomputing with minimal refactoring.\n\n``pathos`` provides methods for configuring, launching, monitoring, and\ncontrolling a service on a remote host. One of the most basic features\nof ``pathos`` is the ability to configure and launch a RPC-based service\non a remote host. ``pathos`` seeds the remote host with the  ``portpicker``\nscript, which allows the remote host to inform the localhost of a port\nthat is available for communication.\n\nBeyond the ability to establish a RPC service, and then post requests,\nis the ability to launch code in parallel. Unlike parallel computing\nperformed at the node level (typically with MPI), ``pathos`` enables the\nuser to launch jobs in parallel across heterogeneous distributed resources.\n``pathos`` provides distributed ``map`` and ``pipe`` algorithms, where a mix of\nlocal processors and distributed workers can be selected.  ``pathos``\nalso provides a very basic automated load balancing service, as well as\nthe ability for the user to directly select the resources.\n\nThe high-level ``pool.map`` interface, yields a ``map`` implementation that\nhides the RPC internals from the user. With ``pool.map``, the user can launch\ntheir code in parallel, and as a distributed service, using standard python\nand without writing a line of server or parallel batch code.\n\nRPC servers and communication in general is known to be insecure.  However,\ninstead of attempting to make the RPC communication itself secure, ``pathos``\nprovides the ability to automatically wrap any distributes service or\ncommunication in a ssh-tunnel. Ssh is a universally trusted method.\nUsing ssh-tunnels, ``pathos`` has launched several distributed calculations\non national lab clusters, and to date has performed test calculations\nthat utilize node-to-node communication between several national lab clusters\nand a user's laptop.  ``pathos`` allows the user to configure and launch\nat a very atomistic level, through raw access to ssh and scp. \n\n``pathos`` is the core of a python framework for heterogeneous computing.\n``pathos`` is in active development, so any user feedback, bug reports, comments,\nor suggestions are highly appreciated.  A list of known issues is maintained\nat http://trac.mystic.cacr.caltech.edu/project/pathos/query.html, with a public\nticket list at https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos/issues.\n\n\nMajor Features\n==============\n\n``pathos`` provides a configurable distributed parallel ``map`` interface\nto launching RPC service calls, with:\n\n    - a ``map`` interface that meets and extends the python ``map`` standard\n    - the ability to submit service requests to a selection of servers\n    - the ability to tunnel server communications with ssh\n\nThe ``pathos`` core is built on low-level communication to remote hosts using\nssh. The interface to ssh, scp, and ssh-tunneled connections can:\n\n    - configure and launch remote processes with ssh\n    - configure and copy file objects with scp\n    - establish an tear-down a ssh-tunnel\n\nTo get up and running quickly, ``pathos`` also provides infrastructure to:\n\n    - easily establish a ssh-tunneled connection to a RPC server\n\n\nCurrent Release\n===============\n\nThis documentation is for version ``pathos-0.2.5``.\n\nThe latest released version of ``pathos`` is available from:\n\n    https://pypi.org/project/pathos\n\n``pathos`` is distributed under a 3-clause BSD license.\n\n    >>> import pathos\n    >>> print (pathos.license())\n\n\nDevelopment Version\n===================\n\nYou can get the latest development version with all the shiny new features at:\n\n    https://github.com/uqfoundation\n\nIf you have a new contribution, please submit a pull request.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n``pathos`` is packaged to install from source, so you must\ndownload the tarball, unzip, and run the installer::\n\n    [download]\n    $ tar -xvzf pathos-0.2.5.tar.gz\n    $ cd pathos-0.2.5\n    $ python setup py build\n    $ python setup py install\n\nYou will be warned of any missing dependencies and/or settings\nafter you run the \"build\" step above.  ``pathos`` depends on ``dill`` and\n``pox``, each of which are essentially subpackages of ``pathos`` but are\nreleased independently. ``pathos`` also depends on ``multiprocess`` and\n``ppft``.  You must install all of the ``pathos`` framework packages for\n``pathos`` to provide the full functionality for heterogeneous computing. \n\nAlternately, ``pathos`` can be installed with ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::\n\n    $ pip install pathos\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n``pathos`` requires:\n\n    - ``python``, **version >= 2.6** or **version >= 3.1**, or ``pypy``\n    - ``dill``, **version >= 0.3.1**\n    - ``pox``, **version >= 0.2.7**\n    - ``ppft``, **version >= 1.6.6.1**\n    - ``multiprocess``, **version >= 0.70.9**\n\nOptional requirements:\n\n    - ``setuptools``, **version >= 0.6**\n    - ``pyina``, **version >= 0.2.2**\n    - ``rpyc``, **version >= 3.0.6**\n    - ``mystic``, **version >= 0.3.4**\n\n\nMore Information\n================\n\nProbably the best way to get started is to look at the documentation at\nhttp://pathos.rtfd.io. Also see ``pathos.tests`` and ``pathos.examples``\nfor a set of scripts that demonstrate the configuration and launching of\ncommunications with ssh and scp, and demonstrate the configuration and\nexecution of jobs in a hierarchical parallel workflow. You can run the test\nsuite with ``python -m pathos.tests``. Tunnels and other connections to\nremote servers can be established with the ``pathos_connect`` script (or with\n``python -m pathos``). See ``pathos_connect --help`` for more information.\n``pathos`` also provides a ``portpicker`` script to select an open port\n(also available with ``python -m pathos.portpicker``). The source code is \ngenerally well documented, so further questions may be resolved by inspecting\nthe code itself.  Please feel free to submit a ticket on github, or ask a\nquestion on stackoverflow (**@Mike McKerns**).\nIf you would like to share how you use ``pathos`` in your work, please send\nan email (to **mmckerns at uqfoundation dot org**).\n\nImportant classes and functions are found here:\n\n    - ``pathos.abstract_launcher``           [the worker pool API definition]\n    - ``pathos.pools``                       [all of the pathos worker pools]\n    - ``pathos.core``                        [the high-level command interface] \n    - ``pathos.hosts``                       [the hostname registry interface] \n    - ``pathos.serial.SerialPool``           [the serial python worker pool]\n    - ``pathos.parallel.ParallelPool``       [the parallelpython worker pool]\n    - ``pathos.multiprocessing.ProcessPool`` [the multiprocessing worker pool]\n    - ``pathos.threading.ThreadPool``        [the multithreading worker pool]\n    - ``pathos.connection.Pipe``             [the launcher base class]\n    - ``pathos.secure.Pipe``                 [the secure launcher base class]\n    - ``pathos.secure.Copier``               [the secure copier  base class]\n    - ``pathos.secure.Tunnel``               [the secure tunnel base class]\n    - ``pathos.selector.Selector``           [the selector base class]\n    - ``pathos.server.Server``               [the server base class]\n    - ``pathos.profile``                     [profiling in threads and processes]\n\n``pathos`` also provides two convenience scripts that are used to establish\nsecure distributed connections. These scripts are installed to a directory\non the user's ``$PATH``, and thus can be run from anywhere:\n\n    - ``portpicker``                         [get the portnumber of an open port]\n    - ``pathos_connect``                     [establish tunnel and/or RPC server]\n\nTyping ``--help`` as an argument to any of the above scripts will print out an\ninstructive help message.\n\n\nCitation\n========\n\nIf you use ``pathos`` to do research that leads to publication, we ask that you\nacknowledge use of ``pathos`` by citing the following in your publication::\n\n    M.M.

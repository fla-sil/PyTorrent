If you want to get some feedback\nabout the process, you can enable logging, by adding the `-v` to the command you want to use. Multiple `-v`\noptions increase the verbosity. The maximum is 3 (`-vvv`)::\n\n  scrapd -v --format csv\n\nTo save the results to a file, use the shell redirection::\n\n  scrapd -v --format csv > results.csv\n\n.. note::\n\n  The logs are displayed to `stderr` and will not appear in the result file generated by the redirection. If you want to\n  include this information add  `&2>1`.\n\nExamples\n^^^^^^^^\n\nRetrieve the traffic fatalities that happened between January 15th 2019 and January 18th 2019, and output the results\nin `json`::\n\n  scrapd --from \"Jan 15 2019\" --to \"Jan 18 2019\" --format json\n\n  [\n    {\n      \"case\": \"19-0161105\",\n      \"crash\": 2,\n      \"date\": \"2019-01-16\",\n      \"fatalities\": [\n        {\n          \"age\": 58,\n          \"dob\": \"1960-02-15\",\n          \"ethnicity\": \"White\",\n          \"first\": \"Ann\",\n          \"gender\": \"Female\",\n          \"generation\": \"\",\n          \"last\": \"Bottenfield-Seago\",\n          \"middle\": \"\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"latitude\": 0.0,\n      \"link\": \"http://austintexas.gov/news/traffic-fatality-2-3\",\n      \"location\": \"West William Cannon Drive and Ridge Oak Road\",\n      \"longitude\": 0.0,\n      \"notes\": \"The preliminary investigation shows that the grey, 2003 Volkwagen Jetta being driven by Ann Bottenfield-Seago failed to yield at a stop sign while attempting to turn westbound on to West William Cannon Drive from Ridge Oak Road.

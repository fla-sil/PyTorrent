Both are easy to use and provide a great speed\nboost as opposed to connecting and reconnecting for every action!\n\nHave an issue? Submit it [here](https://github.com/bucknerns/sshaolin/issues)!\n\n## Installation:\n\nRecommended:\n```\n$ pip install git+https://github.com/bucknerns/sshaolin\n```\n\n## Unit Tests\n\n* Must be running an SSH server at localhost:22\n* Must have Passwordsless SSH Auth to localhost\n```python\n$ tox\n```\n\n## Requirements:\n\n* [paramiko](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko)\n* [PySocks](https://github.com/Anorov/PySocks)\n\n## Features:\n\n* Easily send commands over ssh!\n* Creating persistent ssh sessions!\n* Creating persistent sftp sessions!\n* Easy connection cleanup! (No more manual closing!)\n\n## Examples:\n\nRunning `ls -ltr` on server `foo` as user `bar` with password `blah`\n```python\nfrom sshaolin.client import SSHClient\n\nclient = SSHClient(hostname='foo', username='bar', password='blah')\nresponse = client.execute_command('ls -ltr')\n\n# It comes with an exit status!\nprint(response.exit_status)\n\n# It comes with stdout!\nprint(response.stdout)\n\n# It comes with stderr!\nprint(response.stderr)\n```\n\nTransferring local file `example.txt` to server `foo` as user `bar` with RSA\nfile authentication `/home/bar/.ssh/id_rsa` at `/usr/local/src/example.txt` and\n`/usr/local/src/example2.txt`\n```python\nfrom sshaolin.client import SSHClient\n\nclient = SSHClient(\n    hostname='foo', username='bar', key_filename='/home/bar/.ssh/id_rsa')\nwith open('example.txt', 'r') as fp:\n    data = fp.read()\n\n# Context managers to ensure the closing of a connection!\nwith client.create_sftp() as sftp:\n    sftp.write_file(data=data, remote_path='/usr/local/src/example.txt')\n\n# If you don't want to mess with context managers you can store it as a\n# variable! SSHaolin will clean it up when the program exits!\nsftp = client.create_sftp()\nsftp.write_file(data=data, remote_path='/usr/local/src/example2.txt')\n```\n\nSudoing to `privelegeduser1`, cd'ing to `/usr/local/executables` and running\n`perl randomperlscript.pl`\n```python\nfrom sshaolin.client import SSHClient\n\nclient = SSHClient(\n    hostname='foo', username='bar', key_filename='/home/bar/.ssh/id_rsa')\nshell = client.create_shell()\n# No more need to do hacky workarounds to sudo to another user!\nshell.execute_command('sudo su privelegeduser1')\nshell.execute_command('cd /usr/local/executables')\nperl_response = shell.execute_command('perl randomperlscript.pl')\nshell.close()  # We can close things manually as well!\n\nif perl_response.exit_status == 0:\n    print('Success!')\nelse:\n    raise Exception('Failed to execute randomperlscript.pl correctly')\n```\n\n## Contributing:\n1.

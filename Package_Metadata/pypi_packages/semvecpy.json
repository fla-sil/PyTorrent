It includes some well-tested production-grade work, but it's up to\nusers to be aware of which parts this is.\n\n## For External Users\n\n### Installation\n\nFor the most recent released version, see run `pip install semvecpy`, which installs the most recent\ndeployed package from https://pypi.org/project/semvecpy/\n\nFor development versions, `git clone` the repository, or install using `pip install git+https://github.com/semanticvectors/semvecpy`.\n\n### Imports and Usage\n\nImport paths are designed to start with `semvecpy` in the hope that this will avoid name clashes from common terms such\nas `vectors`. So after installation, the following should work:\n\n```\n>>> from semvecpy.vectors import vector_utils as vu\n>>> vu.normalize([3, 4])\narray([0.6, 0.8])\n```\n\n## For Internal Developers\n\n* Use Python 3+ throughout. \n  * Please don't try to get `print \"Hello World\"` working instead of `print(\"Hello World\")`.\n* Imports should work relative to the project ./semvecpy directory.\n  * E.g., `from semvecpy.vectors import vector_utils`, rather than just `from vectors import vector_utils`.\n  * Please don't add deeper dependencies to your PYTHONPATH or set directories as sources roots in an IDE to make import\n  statements shorter, this may break other internal and external developers.\n  * It's fine to use `from . import my_module` in tests, though fully qualified dependencies are encouraged for readability\n  in module source files.\n* Module names are preferred with underscore_separators, but there's no firm rule in place.\n* Tests for module `.../dir/foo.py` are in `.../dir/foo_test.y`.\n  * This is one of the standard patterns, and it makes it particularly easy to see which modules\n  already have dedicated tests, and whether these files should be moved / renamed if the modules\n  they're testing are renamed.\n  * `pytest .` should run and pass all tests from the `semvecpy` root directory.\n \n### Useful Social Conventions\n\nFeel free to clone, fork, and play with this repository. When it comes to merging code,\nfeel free to submit merge requests, and for frequent contributors, ask the Admins for\nMaintain permissions. We tend to say yes.\n\nBefore sending merge requests, please do check that `pytest .` runs and passes all tests.\nFeel free to ask for help if it doesn't.\n\nSince it's a research project, we encourage work-in-progress and experimental code. \nThis does sometimes lead to duplicated functionality, some variation in naming and code styles,\netc. \n\nTo make things work together, code may be refactored. It's nice to discuss this with original \nauthors, but for small changes, developers with suitable permissions are encouraged to just\ngo ahead. It follows that some changes may be unexpected to some authors. If \nit's a bother just sync your repository wherever you left off, feel free to fork, and we can \ndiscuss how to merge things back together later. Basically DON'T WORRY.\n\n### Release and Version Numbers\n\nSmall \"micro\" updates are encouraged, typically using the `major.minor.micro` pattern as in https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#final-releases.\n\nWe're using odd micro numbers for development versions (merged into github), and even numbers for released versions (in PyPi.)", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/semanticvectors/semvecpy", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "semvecpy", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/semvecpy/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/semvecpy/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/semanticvectors/semvecpy"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/semvecpy/0.1.8/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3", "summary": "Semantic Vectors work in Python", "version": "0.1.8", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>semvecpy</h1>\n<p>Semvecpy is a repository for Semantic Vectors work in Python (version 3 and above).</p>\n<p>It is a research project.

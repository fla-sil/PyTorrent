One of these actions provided by Plone 3\nis a mail action. \n\nA limitation in the supplied mail action is that one can only provide fixed\nemail addresses. But sometimes you'd like to send an email to a user having a\ncertain role on the object that was involved in triggering the content rule.\n\nAn examplary use case and reason for creation of this package is the reviewer \nrole. If an object in a certain location of the site is submitted for\npublication, you would like to inform the user that has the 'reviewer' role\non this area of the site that a new document/object is available for review.\n\nBefore contentrules was available in Plone 3 the place to add this functionality\nwas to to create a python script and attach it to the workflow 'submit' \ntransition that was used for the objects.\n\n.. Note::\n   This product is superceded by `collective.contentrules.mailtorole`, \n   which can send mail to all members having a role on the object, including \n   global roles.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nAdd collective.contentrules.mailtolocalrole to your buildout as an egg or\nfrom source. No (generic setup) installation is necessary.\n\n    Versions before 1.2 did not use the z3c.autoinclude plugin, so you would\n    need to add the package to the zcml slug list of your [instance] section.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nGo to the Plone Control Panel, select Content Rules and add a new Rule. \nUnder 'actions' you now have a new option: Send email to users with local role.\n\nStability / feedback\n====================\n\nthis stand alone package has been derived from an implentation done during\na customer project. It's in production use, there are some tests, but it's\nnot 1.0 yet. Feedback is appreciated.\n\n0.7 update: Several users have commented and sent feedback/patches. Thank you!\n\n\nCaveat\n======\n\nThis contentrule only works on **local** roles. If you check for the review role\nand you have a user a or a group in your user settings defined as a reviewer\nas a global role, these will *NOT* be picked up. \n\nAlso, if you assign users a global review role, you cannot assign them a \nlocal role anymore because the Sharing tab will show an inherited sign\ninstead of a checkbox.\n\nWorse: if you first assign a user/group a local role and\nafterwards also give him a global role in the user settings in the Plone\nControl Panel, the local role will be hidden in the sharing tab of the content\nyou've set the local role to, but will still be active in the background. The\nsharing tab won't even show you the global role unless you explicitly search\nfor the user (which is logical, otherwise every sharing tab woul be spammed\nwith global roles). But when you remove the global role the local role will\nshow up again.\n\n\nThis package was first designed for a use case with local roles, I hadn't\nreally thought of checking for global roles as well. We could add this feature\nin a future version if there is demand for it, but we would have to change the\npackage name, collective.contentrules.mailtorole... ;-)\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nMost of this package has been directly copied from the plone.app.contentrules\nmail action. Additions have been made to check for directly assigned local\nroles, acquired roles, fetching the e-mail To addresses from the user objects,\nmodification of the control panel action, translations and tests.\n \n\n1.3 (2012-10-18)\n----------------\n\n- Officially superceded by collective.contentrules.mailtorole.\n  [maurits]\n\n- Moved to\n  https://github.com/collective/collective.contentrules.mailtolocalrole\n  [maurits]\n\n1.2 (2011-10-28)\n----------------\n\n- use z3c.autoinclude plugin\n- Plone 4.1 compatibility (fixes\n  http://plone.org/products/collective-contentrules-mailtolocalrole/issues/5)\n  [khink]\n\n1.1 (2011-01-07)\n----------------\n\n- Fix the email from header that is generated from the portal owner if no from\n  address is specified.

Fill empty cells in a way that no duplicate\nnumbers exist in any row, column or in any of the 9 sub-squares.\n\n#### Place or change a number\nThere are three ways to place a number in the \"board\":\n1. Move using the arrows to a cell and press the key that responds to the\ncharacter you want. If you selected the basic script then you should press\nany number from 1 to 9.\n2. Click on a cell and a \"picker window\" will appear.\n3. Grab a number from the side bar and drop it in the cell you want.\n\n#### Remove a number\nIf you want to empty a cell:\n- you can go to that cell and press the \u00abBackspace\u00bb or the \u00abDelete\u00bb key.\n- you can click on that cell, in order to show the \u00abpicker window\u00bb,\nand then right click on it.\n- drag the \u00abclear icon\u00bb from the side bar to the cell.\n\n### Picker window\nPicker window will appear inside the clicked cell (if cell is editable)\nand will make it current cell. \n\n#### Mouse clicks\n- Clicking (left-click) on a number will change current cell\nto that character-number.\n- Clicking anywhere outside picker will close it.\n- Right clicking will empty current cell and close the picker window.\n\n#### Keystrokes\n- Any key that responds to a character used in the numeric system\nwill hide the picker and change the cell to that character-number.\n- Escape will close the picker and will not change current cell content.\n- Backspace and Delete keys will empty current cell and close the picker window.\n\n### Key shortcuts\n#### Start screen\n- Ctrl+c: continue previous game (if anyone started and was not solved).\n- Ctrl+n: start a new game.\n- Ctrl+o: opens options screen.\n- Ctrl+q: quit application.\n\n#### Game screen\n- Alt+t: show-hide time passed.\n- Ctrl+h: return to start screen (will save current game).\n- Ctrl+q: same as Ctrl+h.\n- Ctrl+y: redo a move (if applicable).\n- Ctrl+z: undo a move (if applicable).\n\n#### Options screen\n- Ctrl+h: return to start screen (will not save current options).\n- Ctrl+p: preview current options.\n- Ctrl+q: same as Ctrl+h.\n- Ctrl+s: save current options.\n\n## Installation\n### Requirements\n- [qqwing](https://github.com/stephenostermiller/qqwing) must be installed\nin the system.\n\nMost Linux distributions provide a way to install it through their\nmain packaging system.\n\n- Gtk >= 3.18 is needed to run the game. It should be preinstalled\nin your system.\n\n### pip\n#### install\n```sh\npip3 install 'sudokuaspuzzle'\n```\n#### upgrade\n```sh\npip3 install 'sudokuaspuzzle>=0.1.24' --upgrade\n```\n\n## How to start application\nCurrently this package does not provide ways of running the game other\nthan the command line. Pip installation also installs the `sudokuaspuzzle`\n\u00abbinary\u00bb. So just type  `sudokuaspuzzle` in a terminal.\n\n## TODO\nChange appearance (both of the icon and the board) while dragging\na number or the clear icon.\n\n## CREDITS\n* qqwing's creators and maintainers in Linux distributions.\n* Some icons are from Gnome icons in UBUNTU 18.04 distribution.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://gnu.kekbay.gr/sudokuaspuzzle/versions", "keywords": "", "license": "GPLv3", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "sudokuaspuzzle", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/sudokuaspuzzle/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/sudokuaspuzzle/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://gnu.kekbay.gr/sudokuaspuzzle/versions", "Source": "https://gitlab.com/xoristzatziki/sudokuaspuzzle"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/sudokuaspuzzle/0.1.28/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Customizable Sudoku", "version": "0.1.28", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Sudoku as puzzle</h1>\n<p>Yet another Sudoku, treated as puzzle and using custom numbering script.</p>\n<p>This project started as a replacement (<em>for my own pass-free-time</em>)\nwhen Gnome adopted a Sudoku that obscures cells when clicked,\nmaking impossible to have a clear view.

It has been designed to let you shift the pitch and change the time-scale of sounds in real time.\n\nAs aupyom API is really simple, you only need to know a few methods to start playing, the documentation is given as few demonstration notebooks:\n\n* [Playing and mixing multiple sounds](./examples/Playing\\ and\\ mixing\\ multiple\\ sounds.ipynb)\n* [Live modification of the pitch and time-scale of sounds](./examples/Live\\ modification\\ of\\ the\\ pitch\\ and\\ time-scale\\ of\\ sounds.ipynb)\n\n# Installation\n\nThe last stable release is available on PyPI.

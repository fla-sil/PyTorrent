Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.\n\nYou can contribute in many ways:\n\nReport Bugs\n--------------------\n\nReport bugs at https://github.com/matthewgdv/gmailapi/issues\n\nIf you are reporting a bug, please include:\n\n* Your operating system name and version.\n* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.\n* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.\n\nFix Bugs\n--------------------\n\nLook through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with \"bug\" and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to implement a fix for it.\n\nImplement Features\n--------------------\n\nLook through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with \"enhancement\" and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to implement it.\n\nWrite Documentation\n--------------------\n\nThe repository could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.\n\nSubmit Feedback\n--------------------\n\nThe best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/matthewgdv/office/issues.\n\nIf you are proposing a new feature:\n\n* Explain in detail how it would work.\n* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.\n* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)\n\nGet Started!\n--------------------\n\nBefore you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:\n\n1.  If the pull request adds functionality, it should include tests and the docs should be updated. Write docstrings for any functions that are part of the external API, and add\n    the feature to the README.md.\n\n2.  If the pull request fixes a bug, tests should be added proving that the bug has been fixed. However, no update to the docs is necessary for bugfixes.\n\n3.  The pull request should work for the newest version of Python (currently 3.7). Older versions may incidentally work, but are not officially supported.\n\n4.  Inline type hints should be used, with an emphasis on ensuring that introspection and autocompletion tools such as Jedi are able to understand the code wherever possible.\n\n5.  PEP8 guidelines should be followed where possible, but deviations from it where it makes sense and improves legibility are encouraged. The following PEP8 error codes can be\n    safely ignored: E121, E123, E126, E226, E24, E704, W503\n\n6.  This repository intentionally disallows the PEP8 79-character limit. Therefore, any contributions adhering to this convention will be rejected. As a rule of thumb you should\n    endeavor to stay under 200 characters except where going over preserves alignment, or where the line is mostly non-algorythmic code, such as extremely long strings or function\n    calls.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/matthewgdv/gmailapi", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "gmailapi", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gmailapi/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gmailapi/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/matthewgdv/gmailapi"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/gmailapi/0.3.0/", "requires_dist": ["google-api-python-client", "google-auth", "maybe-else", "pathmagic", "pysubtypes", "pymiscutils", "pyiotools"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "A library providing Python bindings for the Gmail api.", "version": "0.3.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>PLEASE NOTE:</h1>\n<p>This library is currently still under development.

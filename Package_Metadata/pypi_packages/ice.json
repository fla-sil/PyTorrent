Since what started as a small experiment turned out to be\nseveral hundred lines of code, it made sense to share the source code on\nthe web, just in case anyone else benefits from it.\n\nThis microframework has a very limited set of features currently. It may\nbe used to develop small web applications. For large web applications,\nit may make more sense to use a more wholesome framework such as\n`Flask`_ or `Django`_.\n\nIt is possible that you may find that this framework is missing a useful\nAPI that another major framework provides. In such a case, you have\ndirect access to the WSGI internals to do what you want via the\ndocumented `API`_.\n\nIf you believe that a missing feature or a bug fix would be useful to\nothers, you may `report an issue`_, or even better, fork this `project\non GitHub`_, develop the missing feature or the bug fix, and send a\npatch or a pull request.

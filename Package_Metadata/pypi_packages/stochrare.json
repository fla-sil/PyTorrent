This may be useful to study a model of a particular phenomenon arising in a research context, to develop new methods and algorithms, or for pedagogical use.\n- framework for designing streamlined workflows for reproducible numerical experiments. In this context, the package may be interfaced with more complex simulation codes (e.g. computational fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics,...), acting mostly as a wrapper providing flexibility while the heavy lifting is done by the underlying code.\n\nUntil now the code has been mostly developed and tested in the first context, but this should change soon...\n\nThe package may also contain code which could be of interest to study deterministic dynamical systems, although this is not the primary goal.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation in the *doc* directory can be compiled in various formats.\n\nIn the *demo* directory, some Jupyter notebooks illustrate the basic features of the package. \nMore should be added soon, in particular for metastability or loss of stability problem and noise-induced transitions.\nThese notebooks will include references to the relevant litterature.\n\n## Citation\n\nWe should soon write a metapaper describing the project.\nIn the meantime, if you use the package for your research, we would appreciate if you could give credit by citing one of the research papers where the development of stochrare started:\n\n\t@article{Herbert2017,\n\tAuthor = {Herbert, Corentin and Bouchet, Freddy},\n\tDoi = {10.1007/BF01106788},\n\tJournal = {Phys.

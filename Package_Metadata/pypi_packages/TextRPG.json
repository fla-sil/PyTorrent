Which attribute is related must be declared explicitely.\n- Added fighting styles: defensive and attack head.\n- Show base TP in battle stats.\n- A bit more 'you did great' output if at least 9 battles were won and the character lost afterwards.\n- The player is prompted to decide on a battle strategy/style each round. \n- The experience can also be increased by simply saying char.exp = new_value. If the new value is lower than the current value, nothing happens, but it gives the return value False.\n- exp is now a property, and so it wil always be up to date.\n- added ministory scripting example.\n- simpler scripting added.\n- Prepared localization of most internal strings.\n- Text output and documentation update.\n- Ask whenever the round is for the player which action to take and many smaller changes (i.e.: tabs to spaces).\n- Added interface for different fighting styles and a hit treshold (below which the character evades the attack or the attack hits the shield).\n- Nicer Experience 'screen'.\n- Nicer battle output and output, when a skill got raised.\n- upgrade now returns what it did: (obj before, obj after).\n- Begun writing the TextRPG. \n\n- FIX: Damage for own attacks except the first wasn't printed.\n- FIX: empty attributes to attribute dict problems -> turned attributes into a property.\n- FIX: persistent game states didn't work due to a version management bug (workdir had not been changed everywhere).\n- FIX: corrected dieing.\n\news 0.1\n\n- created ews as rpg backend package.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://1w6.org/programme", "keywords": "ews,rpg,characters,1d6", "license": "GNU GPL-3 or later", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "TextRPG", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/TextRPG/", "platform": "any", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/TextRPG/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://1w6.org/programme"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/TextRPG/0.4.8/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A simple TextRPG which uses the 1d6 RPG backend module for character management and interaction.", "version": "0.4.8", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            Information: http://rpg-1d6.sf.net <br><br><br>Usage: <br>    - ministory_helper.py <br>    Test the ministory (a testcase for the textrpg module)<br>    - textrpg.py <br>    Start the internal test story of the textrpg. <br><br>Plans: <br>    - Simple to use functions in easy to read scriptfiles in the style of the ministory file. <br>    - char.compete(other, skill_name) -&gt; See who wins and by how much. <br>    - a basic implementation as minimal api reference for anyrpg plugins.<br>    - Add the basic scripting function \"python_interpreter(startup_data)\", which shows an interactive python interpreter with the startup data already entered and interpreted. <br><br><br>Ideas: <br>    - Lazy loading modules, to be able to print stuff at once without having to print before the imports.<br><br><br>Basic design principles for the scripting language: <br>    <br>    - The action is character centered wherever possible and useful. <br>       -&gt; char.say(text) instead of dialog(char, text)<br>    <br>    - Anything which affects only one character or any interaction between only a few characters which is initiated by one of them gets called from the character via char.action(). <br>       -&gt; char.compete_skill(char2, skill_name) instead of competition_skill(char1, char2, skill_name)<br>    <br>    - Anything which affects the whole scene, or a whole group of not necessarily interacting characters gets called as basic function via action() or as class in its own right via class.action(). <br>       -&gt; save([char1, char2]) instead of char1.save() char2.save()<br>    <br>    - The seperate class way should only be chosen, if the class can feel like a character in its own right and needs seperate states which may or may not be persistent over subsequent runs. <br>       -&gt; For example AI.choose_the_way(players_answer) or music.action()<br>    <br>    - Data should be stored inside the chars wherever possible.

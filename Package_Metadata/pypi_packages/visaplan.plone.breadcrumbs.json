Such breadcrumbs instances usually use\nthe current value of a certain request variable, or they may suppress the\ncreation of any breadcrumbs at all.\n\n**NOTE:**\n\nThe purpose of this package is *not* to provide new functionality\nbut to factor out existing functionality from an existing monolitic Zope product.\nThus, it is more likely to lose functionality during further development\n(as parts of it will be forked out into their own packages,\nor some functionality may even become obsolete because there are better\nalternatives in standard Plone components).\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Breadcrumbs classes for several use cases\n- A simple registry for breadcrumbs and the templates they are triggered by\n\nDue to it's history, this package still has a few dependencies which are not\nreally important for the core functionality but rather are related to\nparticular breadcrumbs classes of our old monolithic product and it's eggified\nsuccessors. For this reason, and because of some weaknesses of the current\nbreadcrumbs registry, the current versions are called *0.x*.\n\nBefore you fork you own mycompany.plone.breadcrumbs package, here is what we\nplan for the 1.x versions:\n\n- The ``register`` function will take ...\n  - the *name* of a breadcrumbs class,\n  - the (single) parent (or ``None``, for the standard breadcrumbs from the\n    objects tree), and\n  - optional keyword arguments.\n\n  Currently, it takes an instance of a breadcrumbs class, and the further\n  information thrown at the breadcrumbs class when constructing the instance.\n  The main drawback is that the parent breadcrumb needs to already exist when a\n  new breadcrumb is to be registered, which leads to very annoying module\n  dependenies.\n\n  Thus, versions 1.x will take all the necessary information during\n  registration, and will create a breadcrumb instance when it is first used,\n  including the ``parent`` (and \"grandparents\", if any).\n\n- The ``parents`` list will be replaced by a single ``parent``;\n  each breadcrumb has exactly one parent to which it hands over it's results\n  after processing (or ``None``, which will cause the usual standard\n  breadcrumbs to be created from the objects tree).\n\n- The ``tweak`` method will likely be renamed to something more reasonable;\n  unless someone comes up with something better, this will be ``process``.\n  It's signature might change, too.\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nThis add-on can be seen in action at the following sites:\n\n- https://www.unitracc.de\n- https://www.unitracc.com\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nSorry, we don't have real user documentation yet.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs by adding it to your buildout::\n\n    [buildout]\n\n    ...\n\n    eggs =\n        visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs\n\n\nand then running ``bin/buildout``\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\n- Issue Tracker: https://github.com/visaplan/visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs/issues\n- Source Code: https://github.com/visaplan/visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs\n\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nIf you are having issues, please let us know;\nplease use the issue tracker mentioned above.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe project is licensed under the GPLv2.\n\n.. vim: tw=79 cc=+1 sw=4 sts=4 si et\n\n\nContributors\n============\n\n- Tobias Herp, tobias.herp@visaplan.com\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n\n0.1 (2018-09-18)\n----------------\n\n- Initial release.\n  [tobiasherp]\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs", "keywords": "", "license": "GPL version 2", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs/0.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Flexible breadcrumbs classes for Zope/Plone", "version": "0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            ..

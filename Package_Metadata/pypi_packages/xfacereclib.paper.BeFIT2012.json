By default, the command line sequence::\n\n  $ python bootstrap.py\n  $ bin/buildout\n\nshould download and install most requirements, including the FaceRecLib_, the Database interface packages for the `BANCA database <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xbob.db.banca>`_ and `the Good, the Bad & the Ugly database <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xbob.db.gbu>`_, and, finally, the `Wrapper classes for the CSU Face Recognition Resources <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xfacereclib.extension.CSU>`_.\nUnfortunately, some packages must be installed manually:\n\nBob\n...\nTo install the Bob toolkit, please visit http://www.idiap.ch/software/bob/ and follow the installation instructions.\nPlease verify that you have at least version 1.2.0 of Bob installed.\nIf you have installed Bob in a non-standard directory, please open the **buildout.cfg** file from the base directory and set the 'prefixes' directory accordingly.\n\nCSU Face Recognition Resources\n..............................\nDue to the fact that the CSU toolkit needs to be patched to work with the FaceRecLib, the setup is unfortunately slightly more complicated.\nTo be able to run the experiments based on the CSU toolkit, i.e., the LDA-IR algorithm, please download the CSU Face Recognition Resources from http://www.cs.colostate.edu/facerec.\nAfter unpacking the CSU toolkit, it needs to be patched.\nFor this reason, please follow the instructions:\n\n1. Patch the CSU toolkit::\n\n   $ bin/buildout -c buildout-before-patch.cfg\n   $ bin/patch_CSU.py [YOUR_CSU_SOURCE_DIRECTORY]\n\n2. Update the **buildout.cfg** file by modifying the ``sources-dir = [YOUR_CSU_SOURCE_DIRECTORY]`` entry to point to the base directory of the patched version of the CSU toolkit.\n\nMake sure that you update your installation by **again** calling::\n\n  $ bin/buildout\n\n.. note::\n  The patch file is only valid for the current version of the CSU toolkit (last checked in December 2012).\n  If you have another version, please see the `Getting help`_ section.\n\n.. note::\n  At Idiap, you can also use the pre-patched version of the CSU toolkit.\n  Just use::\n\n    $ bin/buildout -c buildout-idiap.cfg\n\n  instead of downloading and patching the CSU toolkit.\n\n\nDatabases\n.........\n\nOf course, we are not allowed to re-distribute the original images to run the experiments on.\nTo re-run the experiments, please make sure to have your own copy of the `BANCA <http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/banca>`_ and `the Good, the Bad & the Ugly <http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/focs.cfm>`_ images.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nAfter installing you might want to create the documentation for this satellite package, which includes more detailed information on how to re-run the experiments and regenerate the scientific plots from the paper.\nTo generate and open the documentation execute::\n\n  $ bin/sphinx-build docs sphinx\n  $ firefox sphinx/index.html\n\nOf course, you can use any web browser of your choice.\n\n\nGetting help\n------------\n\nIn case anything goes wrong, please feel free to open a new ticket in our `GitHub page <https://github.com/bioidiap/xfacereclib.paper.BeFIT2012>`_, or send an email to manuel.guenther@idiap.ch.\n\n\nCite our paper\n--------------\n\nIf you use the FaceRecLib_ or this package in any of your experiments, please cite the following paper::\n\n  @inproceedings{Guenther_BeFIT2012,\n         author = {G{\\\"u}nther, Manuel AND Wallace, Roy AND Marcel, S{\\'e}bastien},\n         editor = {Fusiello, Andrea AND Murino, Vittorio AND Cucchiara, Rita},\n       keywords = {Biometrics, Face Recognition, Open Source, Reproducible Research},\n          month = oct,\n          title = {An Open Source Framework for Standardized Comparisons of Face Recognition Algorithms},\n      booktitle = {Computer Vision - ECCV 2012.

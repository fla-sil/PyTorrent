is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? yes, but then why make it into an american fantasy? &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; there were so many missed opportunities. imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang - ups, no connotations of sin about sex. sex is natural and normal. how is sex handled in this movie? right. like it was dirty. the closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? nope. one character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty. such typical american puritanism has no place in a movie about japanese geisha. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; did sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off? nope. she lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block. of course she isn't supposed to enjoy it. and that is what i mean about this movie. why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy? why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong? &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; behind mameha the chairman was sayuri's secret patron, and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. he could have rigged the auction and won her himself. nobu didn't even bid. so why did the chairman let that old codger win her and, reeking of old - man stink, [SEP]</td>\n      <td>negative</td>\n      <td>negative</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/ohmeow/blurr/tree/master/", "keywords": "fastai huggingface transformers", "license": "Apache Software License 2.0", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "ohmeow-blurr", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ohmeow-blurr/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ohmeow-blurr/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/ohmeow/blurr/tree/master/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ohmeow-blurr/0.0.2/", "requires_dist": ["fastcore", "fastai2", "transformers", "ipykernel"], "requires_python": ">=3.7", "summary": "A library that integrates huggingface transformers with version 2 of the fastai framework", "version": "0.0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>blurr</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An extensible integration of huggingface transformer models with fastai v2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Install</h2>\n<p>You can now pip install blurr via <code>pip install ohmeow-blurr</code></p>\n<p>Or, even better as this library is under <em>very</em> active development, create an editable install like this:</p>\n<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/ohmeow/blurr.git\ncd blurr\npip install -e \".[dev]\"\n</code></pre>\n<h2>How to use</h2>\n<p>The initial release includes everything you need for sequence classification and question answering tasks.

this can be quite fun to try and beat, and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in, they are even challenging after many play - throughs ), how much nazi gold ( treasure ) you collected and how many bad guys you killed. basically, if you got 100 % of any of aforementioned, you get a bonus, helping you reach the coveted high score placings. the game ( mostly, but not always ) allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing... stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see. you can either run or walk, and amongst your weapons is also a knife... running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard, as [SEP]</td>\n      <td>positive</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>... and train</h3>\n<pre><span class=\"c1\">#slow</span>\n<span class=\"n\">model</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">HF_BaseModelWrapper</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hf_model</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">learn</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">Learner</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dls</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> \n                <span class=\"n\">model</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n                <span class=\"n\">opt_func</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">partial</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Adam</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">decouple_wd</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"kc\">True</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n                <span class=\"n\">loss_func</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">CrossEntropyLossFlat</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span>\n                <span class=\"n\">metrics</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">accuracy</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\n                <span class=\"n\">splitter</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">hf_splitter</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">learn</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">create_opt</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> \n<span class=\"n\">learn</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">freeze</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">learn</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">fit_one_cycle</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">lr_max</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mf\">1e-3</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>epoch</th>\n      <th>train_loss</th>\n      <th>valid_loss</th>\n      <th>accuracy</th>\n      <th>time</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.701890</td>\n      <td>0.662111</td>\n      <td>0.540000</td>\n      <td>00:19</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0.639886</td>\n      <td>0.648174</td>\n      <td>0.590000</td>\n      <td>00:19</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0.583190</td>\n      <td>0.604533</td>\n      <td>0.715000</td>\n      <td>00:19</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<pre><span class=\"c1\">#slow</span>\n<span class=\"n\">learn</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">show_results</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hf_tokenizer</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">hf_tokenizer</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">max_n</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th></th>\n      <th>text</th>\n      <th>category</th>\n      <th>target</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>[CLS] how viewers react to this new \" adaption \" of shirley jackson's book, which was promoted as not being a remake of the original 1963 movie ( true enough ), will be based, i suspect, on the following : those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one... and those who have never been exposed to either, and who are big fans of hollywood's current trend towards \" special effects \" being the first and last word in how \" good \" a film is, are going to love it. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; things i did not like about this adaption : &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; 1. it was not a true adaption of the book. from the articles i had read, this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to. and, that seemed reasonable, no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of the stand! ( and not even then ) but, there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at, in the movie. reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of the shining. i didn't like that, either. what the movie's press release should have said is... \" we got the basic, very basic, idea from shirley jackson's book, we kept the same names of the house and several ( though not all ) of the leading character's names, but then we decided to write our own story, and, what the heck, we watched the changeling and the shining and ghost first, and decided to throw in a bit of them, too. \" &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; 2. they completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts, to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been \" born bad \". no, instead, this \" doctor \" got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their \" insomnia \" ( he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear... like lab rats, who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment... nice guy ). this doctor, who did not have the same name, by the way, was as different from the [SEP]</td>\n      <td>negative</td>\n      <td>negative</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>[CLS] the trouble with the book, \" memoirs of a geisha \" is that it had japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an american man's way of thinking. reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music, sets, and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from japanese ways of thinking were the characters. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; the movie isn't about japan or real geisha. it is a story about a few american men's mistaken ideas about japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. so what is this movie if it isn't about japan or geisha? is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? yes, but then why make it into an american fantasy? &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; there were so many missed opportunities. imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang - ups, no connotations of sin about sex. sex is natural and normal. how is sex handled in this movie? right. like it was dirty. the closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? nope. one character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty. such typical american puritanism has no place in a movie about japanese geisha. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; did sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off? nope. she lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block. of course she isn't supposed to enjoy it. and that is what i mean about this movie. why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy? why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong? &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; behind mameha the chairman was sayuri's secret patron, and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. he could have rigged the auction and won her himself. nobu didn't even bid. so why did the chairman let that old codger win her and, reeking of old - man stink, [SEP]</td>\n      <td>negative</td>\n      <td>negative</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n          </div>"}, "last_serial": 7184454, "releases": {"0.0.1": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "e614f21b2d625c94a69c6d2b47a169f2", "sha256": "851168072dc9d3dca14c45f625814c442a766de8943c75bc854d74c82b2487fc"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "ohmeow_blurr-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "e614f21b2d625c94a69c6d2b47a169f2", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.7", "size": 17980, "upload_time": "2020-04-28T16:31:18", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-28T16:31:18.287521Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/20/41/305165f9512b25b3d2489b92e951adc782ab8d3a925c0ff815a02736cbc1/ohmeow_blurr-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl", "yanked": false}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "e7a28568c5b8f6c88c758e7d168f103a", "sha256": "dd96cad222b1572163c6cafcc992b697c6b1f6c7fec67ba178382110bae20cdb"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "ohmeow-blurr-0.0.1.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "e7a28568c5b8f6c88c758e7d168f103a", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.7", "size": 24249, "upload_time": "2020-04-28T16:31:20", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-28T16:31:20.668176Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/86/06/390e903e0add9e39f7b7416f5c866a89b6cabe648cf3cfcd8ac973f26e9b/ohmeow-blurr-0.0.1.tar.gz", "yanked": false}], "0.0.2": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "6e4c72015c2adf2c8c53dc00541ad8ec", "sha256": "3194f4cd838e073dbc7dbba6410e78d010b1dfe64dab91f26c3c5a5a441be98f"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "ohmeow_blurr-0.0.2-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "6e4c72015c2adf2c8c53dc00541ad8ec", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.7", "size": 20123, "upload_time": "2020-05-07T00:39:29", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-05-07T00:39:29.540399Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/98/9a/23c7104d36998be6f8d3cb0da61408bc8653b13b82ff9616c70e2c56ac8d/ohmeow_blurr-0.0.2-py3-none-any.whl", "yanked": false}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "aa2c8f0a5549614196abaff8673bc7ea", "sha256": "26bfe2ac195f9ce73a1cdbd8fcf71f8461c29356e7abf2ce55d80ba8ed2db708"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "ohmeow-blurr-0.0.2.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "aa2c8f0a5549614196abaff8673bc7ea", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.7", "size": 26166, "upload_time": "2020-05-07T00:39:30", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-05-07T00:39:30.874321Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/4b/c8/42d8ea41f85e7986783bbb05f331451fcd594fd91813401c7776c2616817/ohmeow-blurr-0.0.2.tar.gz", "yanked": false}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "6e4c72015c2adf2c8c53dc00541ad8ec", "sha256": "3194f4cd838e073dbc7dbba6410e78d010b1dfe64dab91f26c3c5a5a441be98f"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "ohmeow_blurr-0.0.2-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "6e4c72015c2adf2c8c53dc00541ad8ec", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.7", "size": 20123, "upload_time": "2020-05-07T00:39:29", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-05-07T00:39:29.540399Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/98/9a/23c7104d36998be6f8d3cb0da61408bc8653b13b82ff9616c70e2c56ac8d/ohmeow_blurr-0.0.2-py3-none-any.whl", "yanked": false}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "aa2c8f0a5549614196abaff8673bc7ea", "sha256": "26bfe2ac195f9ce73a1cdbd8fcf71f8461c29356e7abf2ce55d80ba8ed2db708"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "ohmeow-blurr-0.0.2.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "aa2c8f0a5549614196abaff8673bc7ea", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.7", "size": 26166, "upload_time": "2020-05-07T00:39:30", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-05-07T00:39:30.874321Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/4b/c8/42d8ea41f85e7986783bbb05f331451fcd594fd91813401c7776c2616817/ohmeow-blurr-0.0.2.tar.gz", "yanked": false}], "timestamp": "Fri May  8 03:04:51 2020"}

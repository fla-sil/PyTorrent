These features have been used on multiple news veracity studies, although they can also be used more generically. \n\n## Features\n\nThe features can be broken down into 6 groups:\n\n* Style - This feature group captures the style and structure of the article. It includes POS (part of speech) tags and simple linguistic features such as number of quotes, punctuation, and all capitalized words.\n* Complexity - This feature group captures how complex the writing in the article is. It includes lexical diversity (type-token ratio), multiple reading difficulty metrics, length of words, and length of sentences.\n* Bias - This feature group captures the overall bias and subjectivity in the writing. This feature group is strongly based on Recasens et al. work [1] on detecting bias language.It includes the number of hedges, factives, assertives, implicatives, and opinion words.\n* Affect - This feature group captures sentiment and emotion used in the text. It includes LIWC emotion features such as anger, anxiety, and swear words [2]. It also includes positive and negative sentiment measures using VADER sentiment [3].\n* Moral - This feature group is based on Moral Foundation Theory [4] and lexicons used in [5]\n* Event - This feature group captures two concepts: time and location. This group contains 3 features: the number of locations in the article, the number of dates or times in the article, and the number of time related words in an article.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThe easiest way to install is using pip. This will install all Python dependencies and NLTK downloads needed. \n\n`pip install nela_features`\n\nYou can also download the *nela_features* folder and manually import the package and install dependencies. \n\n## Example package use\n\n**Input**: text as a string\n\n**Output**: feature vector, names of features in vector, both as Python lists\n\n```python\nfrom nela_features.nela_features import NELAFeatureExtractor\n\nnewsarticle = \"Breaking News: Ireland Expected To Become World's First Country To Divest From Fossil Fuels ...\" \n\nnela = NELAFeatureExtractor()\n\n# Extract all feature groups at once\nfeature_vector, feature_names = nela.extract_all(newsarticle)\n\n# Extract each feature group independently\nfeature_vector, feature_names = nela.extract_style(newsarticle) \nfeature_vector, feature_names = nela.extract_complexity(newsarticle) \nfeature_vector, feature_names = nela.extract_bias(newsarticle)\nfeature_vector, feature_names = nela.extract_affect(newsarticle) \nfeature_vector, feature_names = nela.extract_moral(newsarticle) \nfeature_vector, feature_names = nela.extract_event(newsarticle)\n\n```\n\n## Whats different between old and new NELA features?\n\nIf you have used the old version of these features: https://github.com/BenjaminDHorne/Language-Features-for-News, you will notice a few changes: 1. The subjectivity classifier features (previous called NBsubj and NBobj) have been removed. 2. The event group of features has been added. You will also notice the feature names have been better normalized and grouped. \n\n## Papers to cite when using\nThe updated features are described in:\n\n@article{horne2019robust,\n  title={Robust Fake News Detection Over Time and Attack},\n  author={Horne, Benjamin D and N{\\o}rregaard, Jeppe and Adali, Sibel},\n  journal={ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST)},\n  volume={11},\n  number={1},\n  pages={1--23},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={ACM New York, NY, USA}\n}\n\nThe original features were release in:\n\n@inproceedings{horne2018assessing,\n  title={Assessing the news landscape: A multi-module toolkit for evaluating the credibility of news},\n  author={Horne, Benjamin D and Dron, William and Khedr, Sara and Adali, Sibel},\n  booktitle={Companion Proceedings of the The Web Conference 2018},\n  pages={235--238},\n  year={2018}\n}\n\nPlease cite one of the papers if the features are used in publication. \n\n### References\n\n[1] Marta Recasens, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, and Dan Jurafsky. 2013.

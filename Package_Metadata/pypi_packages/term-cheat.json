Here is a command to get your top ten most used commands:\n```\nhistory | awk '{CMD[$2]++;count++;}END { for (a in CMD)print CMD[a] \" \" CMD[a]/count*100 \"% \" a;}' | grep -v \"./\" | column -c3 -s \" \" -t | sort -nr | nl |  head -n10\n```\n\n**Autosuggestions** \\\nIf you are using zsh there is a neat plugin called [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) which will automatically show you suggestions of commands you used before that you can complete using the right arrow key.\n\n**More Related Projects** \\\n\n- [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr)\n- [bropages](http://bropages.org/)\n- [eg](https://github.com/srsudar/eg)\n- [cheat](https://github.com/cheat/cheat) \n\nIf you got other suggestions I would love to include them here.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThere are two reasons why I created TermCheat. First of all I love using the terminal and lately I have been learning more things like systemd and just could not remember all the commands on the first go. While I use the [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) plugin and reverse history search (<kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>r</kbd>) I still had sometimes problems to recall commands. Furthermore both of these options to not give any additional information about the commands. Most modern editors (sublime-text, atom, ...) now have the option to search for commands with ctrl p which I find super helpful. \n\nThe second reason which is even more important for me is that I find text base user interface (tui) very cool. They give you a proper hacker feeling and if done right are beautiful and fast. I wanted to challenge myself and see if I could build such an interface, and voila two weekends later I had the first version of TermCheat running. After working many years on web based interfaces building a tui is a really nice experience because it's pure minimalism.\n\n## License\n\nTermCheat is released under the [MIT License](http://termcheat.mit-license.org/).\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/select/term-cheat", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "term-cheat", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/term-cheat/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/term-cheat/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/select/term-cheat"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/term-cheat/0.1.12/", "requires_dist": ["urwid", "fuzzywuzzy", "pyyaml", "appdirs", "python-Levenshtein"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "A text base UI for collecting and finding termial commands.", "version": "0.1.12", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>TermCheat: your terminal cheat sheet</h1>\n<h2>Synopsis</h2>\n<p>TermCheat is a searchable library of commands that you can copy remix and extend.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"TermCheat screenshot\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/37d533657aef016e218dd5be3c9bffe496a04139/696d672f53637265656e73686f742d5465726d43686561742e706e673f7261773d74727565\"></p>\n<h2>Usage</h2>\n<pre>term-cheat\n</pre>\n<p>Even better if you add a keyboard shortcut to start TermCheat e.g. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>a</kbd></p>\n<p>Add this to your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code>  or ...</p>\n<pre><code>bindkey -s '^A' 'term-cheat --filter^M'\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><code>-s</code> simulate keyboard input</li>\n<li><code>^A</code> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>a</kbd></li>\n<li><code>^M</code> <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to run the command</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>\n<p>In <em>list</em> mode</p>\n<ul>\n<li><kbd>enter</kbd> execute command</li>\n<li><kbd>/</kbd> to fuzzy filter / search for a command</li>\n<li><kbd>a</kbd> add new command</li>\n<li><kbd>e</kbd> edit selected command</li>\n<li><kbd>d</kbd> delected the selected command</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In <em>edit</em> mode</p>\n<ul>\n<li><kbd>esc</kbd> to leave edit mode without saving</li>\n<li><kbd>ctrl o</kbd> to save the command to your database</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In <em>filter</em> mode</p>\n<ul>\n<li><kbd>esc</kbd> to clear the filter</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>While the package is waiting for approval from the snap store you can install it by downloading it from here and installing it with snap.</p>\n<pre><code>curl -OL https://github.com/select/term-cheat/releases/download/0.1.11/term-cheat-0.1.11_amd64.snap\nsudo snap install --classic --dangerous term-cheat-0.1.11_amd64.snap\n</code></pre>\n<p>To install it from source do the following.</p>\n<pre>git clone https://github.com/select/term-cheat.git\n<span class=\"nb\">cd</span> term-cheat\npipenv install\npipenv shell\npython3 term-cheat-app\n</pre>\n<h2>Related Tools and Projects</h2>\n<p><strong>Reveser History Search</strong><br>\nSearch through your shell history with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>R</kbd></p>\n<p><strong>Alias</strong> <br>\nCreate a file that contains aliases for your most used commands.\nCreate a the aliases file with <code>touch ~/.aliases</code> and add some aliases like</p>\n<pre><code>alias lt='ls -ltr'\nalias df='pydf -h -B'\n</code></pre>\n<p>now source the file in your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code></p>\n<pre><code>source $HOME/.aliases\n</code></pre>\n<p>You could write all aliases directly in you rc file but this way it's more portable if you switch from e.g. bash to zsh.</p>\n<p>Another trick is to sort your history for the commands you use the most and created aliases for these commands to save you time.

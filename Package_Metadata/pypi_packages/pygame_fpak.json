To use\nit:\n\n1. You will need a Linux system with Flatpak >= 0.8 installed, such as Fedora 25\n   or Ubuntu 17.10.\n2. Install using ``pip install pygame_fpak``. The tool needs Python 3 to run,\n   even if your game uses Python 2.\n3. Create a ``pygame-fpak.toml`` config file like this:\n\n   .. code-block:: toml\n   \n       # At the moment, you can specify \"3.6\", \"3.4\" or \"2.7\".\n       # 3.6 produces a somewhat bigger app to download.\n       python = \"3.6\"\n       # User-visible name\n       name = \"Solarwolf\"\n       # Identifier based on a reverse domain name you control. E.g. if your\n       # project is on Github, you could use io.github.username.reponame\n       appid = \"org.pygame.solarwolf\"\n       # Files/directories needed to run the game - relative paths from where\n       # the config file lives.\n       files = [\n         \"solarwolf\"\n       ]\n       # The function to start your game. This will be called like:\n       # from solarwolf.cli import main; main()\n       entry-point = \"solarwolf.cli:main\"\n\n       # Icons in different sizes. Icons should be square, sizes are pixels\n       # along one side of a square. 32, 48 and 64 are common.\n       [icons]\n       64 = \"dist/solarwolf.png\"\n\n4. Run ``python3 -m pygame_fpak pygame-fpak.toml``.\n\n------\n\nThe other code in this repo builds the base apps for the tool described above.\nTo build & install them:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    # Slow, but only needed once:\n    make install-runtime\n    \n    # Build the base applications and install them:\n    make install-baseapp-py36.done\n    make install-baseapp-py34.done\n    make install-baseapp-py27.done\n\nThere are three variants of the base application:\n\n- ``-py36`` includes Python 3.6 as ``/app/bin/python3``. This is approximately\n  30 MiB to download, and 140 MiB when installed. The *Aliens* example is built\n  on this by default.\n- ``-py34`` uses Python 3.4, which is provided by the freedesktop.org runtime.\n  This makes it smaller - about 7 MiB to download, and 40 MiB installed - but\n  you can't use the latest Python features in your code.\n- ``py27`` uses Python 2.7. It is a similar size to the Python 3.4 base app.\n\nFlatpak applications use a *runtime*, a bundle of common libraries and\nexecutables. If your application is the first a user installs with a given\nruntime, Flatpak will download the runtime as well. Hopefully most apps will\nshare a few runtimes, so that installation is quick and easy.\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/takluyver/pygame-flatpak-test", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "pygame_fpak", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pygame_fpak/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pygame_fpak/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/takluyver/pygame-flatpak-test"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pygame_fpak/0.1/", "requires_dist": ["pytoml"], "requires_python": ">=3.5", "summary": "Flatpak packaging for pygame games.", "version": "0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>Flatpak packaging for pygame</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://flatpak.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flatpak</a> is a sandboxed application packaging system\nfor Linux (<a href=\"http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">developer docs</a>).\nPygame is a framework for making games.</p>\n<p>This is an <em>experimental</em> tool to make Flatpak packages for pygame games.

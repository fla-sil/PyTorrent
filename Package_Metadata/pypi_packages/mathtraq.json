You specify how\nmany equations you want, parameters for the operands, the operator and the answer (i.e. decimals to round to), as well as\nthe pause length between the question and the answer and between equations themselves, and you get an mp3 file that satisfies those parameters.\n\nWhy? Because I suck at arithmetic and I'm too lazy to sit and just practice. Now I can practice on the go like all the cool kids.\n\n\n# How to use\n\nUse python 3.6. Untested with python 2. \n\nAn example run would be:\n\n```\npython run.py  10#0(1)1000{+-}-50(2)60?5000(2) 10#10(0)99{*}10(0)99?4000(0)\n```\nThis assumes you're in the directory where the Mathtraq package has been installed.\n\n\nThe following is copied from the help output of the app itself:\n\n```\nusage: run.py [-h] [-j OUTPUT_JSON] [-o OUTPUT_MP3] [-d MAX_DIGITS]\n                   [-b BUFFER_SIZE] [-v {0,1,2,3}]\n                   [-p pause_between_questions]\n                   template [template ...]\n\nCreate an mp3 to practice arithmetic on the go\n\npositional arguments:\n  template              Example: 10#0(1)1000{+/-}-50(2)60?3000(2) will create\n                        10 questions where the lhs is between 0 and 1000 with\n                        maximum 1 decimal place and the rhs is between -50 and\n                        60 with a maximum of 2 decimal places. They will be a\n                        mix of addition, division and subtraction, and a\n                        3000ms pause will occur before the answer is given.\n                        The answer will be rounded to 2 decimal places. Note\n                        that one * in the ops is multiplcation. Two * means\n                        'to the power of' and three means both multiplication\n                        and powers\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -j OUTPUT_JSON, --json OUTPUT_JSON\n                        Specify a file to which the equation data will be\n                        written in JSON format\n  -o OUTPUT_MP3, --output OUTPUT_MP3\n                        MP3 file output (default: ['mathtraq.mp3'])\n  -d MAX_DIGITS, --digits MAX_DIGITS\n                        Maximum digits (precision) (default: [600])\n  -b BUFFER_SIZE, --buffer_size BUFFER_SIZE\n                        Mathtraq works by concatenating a number of small\n                        files. This argument specifies how many to join at a\n                        time.

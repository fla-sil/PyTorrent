Code\n    development can now be performed using \"modern\" editors and compiles\n    with lightning speed.\n\npyatasm is a python wrapper that uses the (slightly modified) C code from\nATasm. It provides the front end to the assembler and returns the bytes (and\nother metadata) from the assembly.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\n* python 2.7 (but not 3.x yet) capable of building C extensions\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\npyatasm is available through PyPI::\n\n    pip install pyatasm\n\nor you can compile from source::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/robmcmullen/pyatasm.git\n    cd pyatasm\n    python setup install\n\nYour version of python must be able to build C extensions, which should be\nautomatic in most linux and on OS X. You may have to install the python\ndevelopment packages on linux distributions like Ubuntu or Linux Mint.\n\nWindows doesn't come with a C compiler, but happily, Microsoft provides a\ncut-down version of their Visual Studio compiler just for compiling Python\nextensions! Download and install it from\n`here <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266>`_.\n\nDevelopers\n----------\n\nIf you check out the pyatasm source from the git repository or you want to\nmodify pyatasm and change the .pyx file, you'll need Cython. The .pyx file is\ncompiled to C as a side effect of using the command::\n\n    python setup.py sdist\n\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nA simple example::\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env python\n\n    from pyatasm import Assemble\n\n    asm = Assemble(\"tests/works.m65\")\n\n    if asm:\n        print asm.segments\n        print asm.equates\n        print asm.labels\n    else:\n        print asm.errors\n\nBecause pyatasm is a very thin wrapper around ATasm (and very little ATasm code\nwas changed) it needs to creates files to do its work. These files will be\ncreated in the same directory as the source file, so the directory must be\nwriteable.\n\nThe segments attribute will contain a list of 3-tuples, each tuple being the\nstart address, the end address, and the bytes for each segment of the assembly.\nA segment is defined as a contiguous sequence of bytes. If there is change of\norigin, a new segment will be created.\n\n\n\nLicense\n==========\n\npyatasm, python wrapper for ATasm\n\nATasm is Copyright (c) 1998-2014 Mark Schmelzenbach\npyatasm is Copyright (c) 2016 Rob McMullen (feedback@playermissile.com)\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Turbogears installs need to run.\n        \n        We list the packages here so you can make a standard setup.py without messing around with pip\n        freeze, or performing a non standard install using the Turbogears Repository.\n        \n        Use this package if\n        -------------------------------\n        Have you ever wanted to deploy a python package with Turbogears as a

   Do you want to tell your users to just pip install <your package> that relies on Turbogears, rather\n        that having to tell them to run a custom command first to install Turbogears from the TG

  -------------------------------\n        TG2Frozen has all the standard dependancies apart from MYSQL-python (as you may be using a different DB) and it\n        does not contain a specific sqlalchemy version, as there are backward compatibility issues and you may want to\n        use a particular version.\n        \n        Your application's **setup.py** might look like::\n        \n

It was developed mainly to provide access to SenseME fans for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) using asyncio but should work fine in other applications.\n\nThis library (based on [TomFaulkner's](https://github.com/TomFaulkner/SenseMe) library) keeps an open socket to each controlled fan so that state changes from any source including local control are pushed more or less immediately. This approach is far more robust and responsive. A discovery task was also added to periodically detect SenseME devices on the network.\n\nSniffing the packets and documenting the protocol was the work of [Bruce](http://bruce.pennypacker.org/tag/senseme-plugin/). His work in making an [Indigo plugin](https://github.com/bpennypacker/SenseME-Indigo-Plugin) made this library possible.\n\n## Command line access\n\nThe aiosenseme package now installs a command line script along with the package. To discover all fans on the network type the following.\n\n```console\n$ aiosenseme --discover\nStudio Beam Fan\n  Room Name: Studio Fans, Room Type: Family Room\n  Model: Haiku Fan with light, FW Version: 2.5.0\n  IP Addr: 192.168.1.2, MAC Addr: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\n  Token: 73264cb2-1234-1234-1234-012345678912\nStudio Vault Fan\n  Room Name: Studio Fans, Room Type: Family Room\n  Model: Haiku Fan with light, FW Version: 2.5.0\n  IP Addr: 192.168.1.3, MAC Addr: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\n  Token: 73264cb2-1234-1234-1234-012345678913\n```\n\nHere both the fan speed is set and the light is turned on. The room name (Studio Fans) was used to set the fan so all fans in that room changed to the same state. Keep in mind that changing an individual fan that is a member of a room will do the same thing. Notice also that Whoosh was turned off when the fan speed was set specific value.\n\n```console\n$ aiosenseme --name \"Studio Fans\" --speed 3 --light on\nStudio Beam Fan\n  Room Name: Studio Fans, Room Type: Family Room\n  Model: Haiku Fan with light, FW Version: 2.5.0\n  IP Addr: 192.168.1.2, MAC Addr: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\n  Token: 73264cb2-1234-1234-1234-012345678912\nState: Fan is on (speed: 2), Light is off, Whoosh: on\nNew State: Fan is on (speed: 3), Light is on (brightness: 16), Whoosh: off\n```\n\nYou can also select the fan by IP address.\n\n```console\n$ aiosenseme -n 192.168.1.3 --speed 4\nStudio Vault Fan\n  Room Name: Studio Fans, Room Type: Family Room\n  Model: Haiku Fan with light, FW Version: 2.5.0\n  IP Addr: 192.168.1.3, MAC Addr: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\n  Token: 73264cb2-1234-1234-1234-012345678912\nState: Fan is off, Light is off, Whoosh: on\nNew State: Fan is on (speed: 4), Light is off, Whoosh: off\n```\n\nTo just read the fan state type the following.\n\n```console\n$ aiosenseme -n \"Studio Vault Fan\"\nStudio Vault Fan\n  Room Name: Studio Fans, Room Type: Family Room\n  Model: Haiku Fan with light, FW Version: 2.5.0\n  IP Addr: 192.168.1.3, MAC Addr: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\n  Token: 73264cb2-1234-1234-1234-012345678912\nState: Fan is off, Light is off, Whoosh: off\n```\n\n## Issues\n\n* UDP port 31415 must be available and not blocked by a firewall.\n* This library will not handle multiple instances of discovery running on the same machine.", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/mikelawrence/aiosenseme", "keywords": "Haiku HaikuHome SenseME fan home automation BigAssFans", "license": "GPL3", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "aiosenseme", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/aiosenseme/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/aiosenseme/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/mikelawrence/aiosenseme"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/aiosenseme/0.3.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "SenseME by Big Ass Fans asynchronous Python library", "version": "0.3.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>aiosenseme library</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://badge.fury.io/py/aiosenseme\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"PyPI version\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/38c4acb475876933cb152a29c074a6d00cbb0d64/68747470733a2f2f62616467652e667572792e696f2f70792f61696f73656e73656d652e737667\"></a> <a href=\"https://pepy.tech/project/aiosenseme\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Downloads\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/98c433fdc1c8cc574285fe876a7deb5549c2a131/68747470733a2f2f706570792e746563682f62616467652f61696f73656e73656d65\"></a></p>\n<p>This asynchronous Python library provides periodic discovery, control and push-based status for SenseME fans by Big Ass Fans.

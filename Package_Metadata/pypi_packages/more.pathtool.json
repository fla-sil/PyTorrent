This way you can see exactly\nwhat paths a Morepath application supports, including views and mounted\napplications. It does this by reading the configuration information of\na Morepath application.\n\nTo create such a tool you do the following, for instance in \n``tool.py`` of your project::\n\n  from more.pathtool import path_tool\n  from .someplace import SomeApp\n\n\n  def my_path_tool():\n      SomeApp.commit()\n      path_tool(SomeApp)\n\nwhere ``SomeApp`` is the application you want to query, typically the\nroot application of your project.\n\nNow you need to hook it up in ``setup.py`` to you can have the tool\navailable::\n\n    entry_points={\n        'console_scripts': [\n            'morepathtool = myproject.tool:my_path_tool',\n        ]\n    },\n\nYou also need to include ``more.pathtool`` in your setup requirements.\n\nAfter you install your project, you should now have a ``morepathtool``\ntool available that lets you query your project for path information.\n\nBy default the path tool generates a CSV file with information in it\nabout paths in your application::\n\n  $ morepathtool paths.csv\n\nYou can open it in a spreadsheet application such as Excel or\nOpenOffice Calc. Note that if you your locale is European you have to\nadd ``-csv-dialect=europe`` to set the CVS writer to use ``;``` as the\ndelimiter instead of ``,`` so that Excel can read it.\n\nColumns\n-------\n\nThe columns in the CSV file are as follows:\n\npath\n  The URL path. If this is a named view, the view name is appended\n  with a ``+``. If this is an absorb path, the ``/...`` is appended.\n  If this is an internal view, the path will be ``internal``.\n\ndirective\n  The directive used.\n\nfilename\n  The filename in which this configuration was made.\n\nlineno\n  The line number of the configuration.\n\nmodel\n  A dotted name to the model class exposed.\n\npermission\n  A dotted name to the permission used for the path. Or ``public`` if no\n  permission declared, or ``internal`` if this is an internal view. ``path``\n  and ``mount`` directives have no permission.\n\nview_name\n  The view name predicate, if any. By default this is empty. ``path``\n  and ``mount`` directives have no view name.\n\nrequest_method\n  The request method predicate. By default this is ``GET` ``path`` and\n  ``mount`` directives have no request method predicates.\n\nextra_predicates\n  Whether there are additional predicates in use. Go to the actual code\n  to see them.\n\nCHANGES\n*******\n\n0.6.1 (2016-11-09)\n==================\n\n- Fix README; it was naming the csv-dialect option wrong.\n\n0.6 (2016-11-09)\n================\n\n- Added the ``--csv-dialect`` option so you can indicate the CSV\n  dialect to use.\n\n- Added a ``europe`` dialect where the delimiter is ``;``, not\n  ``,``. This to support Excel in Europe, as its CSV format is\n  locale-dependent.

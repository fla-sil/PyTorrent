This helps deal with navigation bars filled with single-page folders to keep things looking tidy.\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall the plugin:\n\n```bash\npip install mkdocs-nav-enhancements\n```\n\nAdd the plugin to your `mkdocs.yml` [MkDocs configuration](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/) file:\n\n```yaml\nplugins:\n  - mkdocs-nav-enhancements\n```\n\n## Known issues\n\nWhen changing the page title, or collapsing single-page folders, this can sometimes result in the effective page title being quite different. Currently this plugin does not re-sort the nav bar alphabetically when this happens.\n\nA second issue is that these options are not independently controllable, at least not in the first version; it's all or nothing for now!\n\n## Contributing\n\nSource code is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/Rylon/mkdocs-nav-enhancements).\n\nPlease report issues and feature requests on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Rylon/mkdocs-nav-enhancements).\n\nPull Requests are also welcome!\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/rylon/mkdocs-nav-enhancements", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "mkdocs-nav-enhancements", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-nav-enhancements/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-nav-enhancements/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/rylon/mkdocs-nav-enhancements"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-nav-enhancements/0.9.1/", "requires_dist": ["mkdocs (>=1)"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "This is a small plugin for the excellent MkDocs project which makes some enhancements to the navigation.", "version": "0.9.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>MkDocs Nav Enhancements</h1>\n<p>This is a small plugin for the excellent <a href=\"https://www.mkdocs.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">MkDocs</a> project which makes some enhancements to the navigation.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<h3>Enhanced titles</h3>\n<p>By default, MkDocs looks for a level 1 atx-style header found at the top of the document and uses that for the page title.</p>\n<p>If you are dealing with documentation from third-party sources you may find that some of them start their titles at level 2 (possibly for aesthetic reasons), or use setext-style headers instead.</p>\n<p>This plugin will try to help by looking through each Markdown document and using the following rules to detect a page title instead:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Use the first atx-style header found in the document at any level between 1 to 6, which is any line beginning with between 1 to 6 '#' characters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Or use the first setext-style header, which is any line where the line immediately after contains only '=' or '-' characters, effectively 'underlining' the line.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It will also remove any additional markup that is found in the title, such as image or link tags, which would otherwise be rendered as string literals in the generated HTML.</p>\n<h3>Reduced folders</h3>\n<p>In order to de-clutter the navigation, the plugin looks for any sections containing only one page, and tries to collapse that page up a level into its parent.

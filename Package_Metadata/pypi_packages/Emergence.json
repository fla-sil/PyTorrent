Builds and runs individual-based ecological models based on dynamics of selection, stochasticity, and energetics.\n\n2. Quantifies and records individual-to-ecosystem level information across time steps and models.\n\n3. Provides quantitative and graphical tools for analysis of ecological patterns and relationships.\n\nThe ODD protocol\n----------------\n\nGrimm *et al* (2006) developed a protocol known as the ODD as a standard for describing individual-based models (IBMs).\nBecause **Emergence** is a platform for IBMs and not simply a model, we descibe **Emergence** as close as reasonable according to the ODD.\nSee EmergencePrePrint.md file located in the manuscript directory.\nThe user should note that the ODD was not intended for describing software.\n\nGrimm, V. *et al*.

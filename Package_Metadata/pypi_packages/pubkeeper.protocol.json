You provide the server a JWT which should be issued to you by the admin of the server.  The token, should, have an issuer and audience of _pubkeeper_, and the subject should be your client.  Along with those, the token will also contain an array of rights associated for this token.\n\n\n### authenticated\n- **params**\n - authenticated - Your authenticated status\n\n```\nPubkeeperPacket(Packet.AUTHENTICATED, {\n\tauthenticated: Bool\n})\n```\n\nIn response to every **authenticate** packet, you will receieve an **authenticated** packet which alerts you to your current status with the PubKeeper server.\n\n### brewer_register\n-  **params**\n - topic - Topic you will be brewing to\n - brewer - configuration of your brewer\n\n```\nPubkeeperPacket(Packet.BREWER_REGISTER, {\n\t'topic': 'test.topic',\n\t'brewer': {\n\t\t'uuid': 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'\n \t\t'hostname': 'localhost',\n \t\t'port': 9899,\n \t\t'protocol': 'udp'\n   \t}\n })\n```\n\nThis method will register your **_brewer_** with the **_pubkeeper_** server for a specific topic.  The brewer configuration should be able to instruct a subscriber how to listen to your stream of data.  This method, will send a **brewer_notify** packet to all clients subscribed to this topic.\n\n### brewer_unregister\n-  **params**\n - topic - Topic you are brewing to\n - brewer - configuration of your brewer\n\n```\nPubkeeperPacket(Packet.BREWER_UNREGISTER, {\n\t'topic': 'test.topic',\n\t'brewer': {\n\t \t'uuid': 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'\n\t\t'hostname': 'localhost',\n\t\t'port': 9899,\n\t\t'protocol': 'udp'\n\t}\n})\n```\n\nThis method, an inverse of above, will instruct the server to remove your brewer from being available for consumption.  It will also send a **brewer_removed** packet to all clients subscribed to this topic, to instruct them to destory their patrons. _[Note: You may supply only a UUID string, rather than an object for the brewer to unregister only.

The topic string may be of a format with wildcards.  For example, _test.*_ would susbcribe to all topics that begin with _test_.  This method will initiate the server to start sending you **brewer_notify** packets for all current brewers in the system.\n\n\n### unsubscribe\n-  **params**\n - topic - Topic to unsubscribe from\n\n```\n \tPubkeeperPacket(Packet.UNSUBSCRIBE, {\n \t\t'topic': 'test.topic'\n \t})\n```\n\nUsed to inform the server that you would like to cancel your subscription to the given topic.  The server will not send you any other information, it is the clients liability to close all connections to brewers.\n\n### Error\n-  **params**\n - message - Error Message\n\n```\n \tPubkeeperPacket(Packet.ERROR, {\n\t\t'message': 'Failure doing something'\n \t})\n```\n\nSomething on the server end went wrong, and this will alert clients to the problem.

It can take univariate or multivariate datasets and make predictions using single-input single-output (SISO), multi-input single-output (MISO) or multi-input multi-output (MIMO) frameworks.\n\nIt was built for the purpose of testing the hypothesis that improved predictive performance can be achieved by applying the multi-task learning paradigm to commodity price forecasting. As such many of the example notebooks are built for this purpose.\n\nThe tools can equally be applied to any user chosen datasets, provided the datasets are loaded in the format shown in the example csvs, or are inputed directly as shown in the \"generic\" notebooks.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull documentation can be found on https://industrial-metals-forecaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.\n\nRead the docs will not show the models module online.

The main purpose of DWords is to help non-English-speaking people study English, but not limited to English, you can also use it to remember anything you want.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Open source and cross platform\n- Memorize words with ubiquitous Danmakus while using a computer\n- Synchronize between multiple devices by email\n- Add words using you phone by email\n- Included dictionaries\n\n## Installation\n\nDWords is written by Python3, we recommend install via pip. Please make sure your machine has been installed Python3.\n\nRunning the following in your terminal and DWords is installed:\n\n```sh\npip3 install DWords\n```\n\nYou can also install from source code:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/luyuhuang/DWords.git\ncd DWords\ngit checkout master\npython3 setup.py install\n```\n\nIf you don't know Python, we also provide binary distributions for Windows. Click [here](https://github.com/luyuhuang/DWords/releases) to download it. Caution, binary distributions may not be trusted by antivirus software.\n\n## Usage\n\nType `DWords` in you terminal to start DWords. If you downloaded binary distributions, double click `DWords.exe` to start it.\n\n### Add words\n\nClick \"+\" button and enter in the input box below to add words. The format is: the first line is the word, the second line is a short explanation and followed by detailed explanations. The short explanation can be displayed directly on the Danmaku, while the detailed explanation can only be displayed on the details panel. Detailed explanation is optional. For example:\n\n```\nword\na unit of language\na unit of language that native speakers can identify; a brief statement.\n```\n\nAnd then click \"Commit\" button to add it, or press Ctrl + Enter.\n\n### Using dictionary\n\nDWords included dictionaries, click \"Setting\" button and set it in the \"Common\" tab. Currently only English-Chinese dictionary is supported, including more than 30,000 words. Once setting up the dictionary, the explanation will appear automatically when you press Enter while input a word.\n\n### Synchronize\n\nDWords can synchronize words between multiple devices. In order to use this feature, you need to set up an account first. Click \"Setting\" button and set the email address, email password, SMTP server and POP3 server in the \"Account\" tab. DWords'll synchronize data via send emails, so we recommend using an infrequently used mailbox.\n\n### Add words by email\n\nOnce setting up the account, you can add add words by sending email to the set up mailbox. Edit a email using any email client, with the subject \"DWords add\" and the format of content is similar to add words, but you can add more then one words, separated by triple dash \"---\" or triple comma \",,,\"; Triple swung dash \"~~~\" or triple dot \"...\" tells DWords it's the end. For example:\n\n```\nworld\n\u4e16\u754c\n---\nword\n\u5355\u8bcd\n,,,\nhello\n\u4f60\u597d\n...\nThe content after \"...\" will be ignored.\n```\n\nThen send the email to the mailbox you set up.\n\nIf you have set up the dictionary, you don't have to specify the explanation and DWords'll consult the dictionary automatically.\n\n## Contribution\n\nIf you found any problems or have any suggestions, open an [issue](https://github.com/luyuhuang/DWords/issues).

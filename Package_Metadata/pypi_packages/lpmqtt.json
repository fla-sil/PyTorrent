By default it will just mark them\n                    as read.\n\nMQTT\n----\nJust as with imap there are a few required options for talking to MQTT, which\nis the other axis of communication in lpmqtt. The options for configuring MQTT\ncommunication go in the *[mqtt]* section. The 2 required options are:\n\n * **hostname** - The hostname for the MQTT broker\n * **base_topic** - The base topic name to use for the gerrit events\n\nThere are also a couple optional settings for communicating with mqtt that you\ncan set:\n\n * **port** - The port to communicate to the MQTT broker on. By default this\n              is set to 1883, the default MQTT port. This only needs to be set\n              if your broker uses a non-default port.\n * **keepalive** - Used to set the keepalive time for connections to the MQTT\n                   broker. By default this is set to 60 seconds.\n * **username** - Used to set the auth username to connect to the MQTT broker\n                  with.\n * **password** - Used to set the auth password to connect to the MQTT broker\n                  with.

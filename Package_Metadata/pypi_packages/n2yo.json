Also return the satellite's azimuth and elevation with respect to the observer location. Each element in the response array is one second of calculation. First element is calculated for current UTC time. \n\nget_visualpasses: Get predicted visual passes for any satellite relative to a location on Earth. A \"visual pass\" is a pass that should be optically visible on the entire (or partial) duration of crossing the sky.

This function is useful mainly for predicting satellite passes to be used for radio communications. The quality of the pass depends essentially on the highest elevation value during the pass, which is one of the input parameters. \n\nget_above: The \"above\" function will return all objects within a given search radius above observer's location. The radius (\u03b8), expressed in degrees, is measured relative to the point in the sky directly above an observer (azimuth). \n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/circuitqed/n2yo", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "n2yo", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/n2yo/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/n2yo/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/circuitqed/n2yo"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/n2yo/0.0.5/", "requires_dist": ["requests"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Python wrapper for the N2YO API", "version": "0.0.5", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>N2YO Python API</h1>\n<p>This python package is a wrapper to access the N2YO REST API.</p>\n<p>For each transaction, the caller must be identified and authorized by a license key (API key).

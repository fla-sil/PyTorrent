The project uses the\n[Apache 2.0 OpenSource license](LICENSE.md).\n\nPlease refer to the\n[AFDKO Overview](https://adobe-type-tools.github.io/afdko/AFDKO-Overview.html)\nfor a more detailed description of what is included in the package.\n\nPlease see the\n[wiki](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/wiki)\nfor additional information, such as links to reference materials and related\nprojects.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe AFDKO requires [Python](http://www.python.org/download) 3.6\nor later.\n\nReleases are available on the [Python Package\nIndex](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/afdko) (PyPI) and can be installed\nwith [pip](https://pip.pypa.io).\n\n### Installing\n\n**Option 1 (Recommended)**\n\n- Create a virtual environment:\n\n        python3 -m venv afdko_env\n\n- Activate the virtual environment:\n\n    - macOS & Linux\n\n            source afdko_env/bin/activate\n\n    - Windows\n\n            afdko_env\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n\n- Install [afdko](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/afdko):\n\n        pip install afdko\n\nInstalling the **afdko** inside a virtual environment prevents conflicts\nbetween its dependencies and other modules installed globally.\n\n**Option 2**\n\nInstall [afdko](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/afdko) globally:\n\n    pip install --user afdko\n\n### Updating\n\nUse the `-U` (or `--upgrade`) option to update the afdko (and its\ndependencies) to the newest stable release:\n\n    pip install -U afdko\n\nTo get pre-release and in-development versions, use the `--pre` flag:\n\n    pip install -U afdko --pre\n\n### Uninstalling\n\nTo remove the afdko package use the command:\n\n    pip uninstall afdko\n\nBuild from source\n-----------------\n\nFirst you must have installed the development tools for your platform.\n\nOn the Mac, install these with:\n\n    xcode-select --install\n\nOn Linux (Ubuntu 17.10 LTS or later), install these with:\n\n    apt-get -y install python3.6\n    apt-get -y install python-pip\n    apt-get -y install python-dev\n\nOn Windows, you need Visual Studio 2017.\n\nTo build the **afdko** from source, clone the [afdko GitHub\nrepository](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko), ensure the `wheel`\nmodule is installed (`pip install wheel`), then `cd` to the top-level\ndirectory of the afdko, and run:\n\n    pip install .\n\n**Note**\n\nIt's not possible to install the afdko in editable/develop mode using\n`pip install -e .` ; this is because the toolkit includes binary C executables\nwhich setup.py tries to install in the bin/ (or Scripts/) folder, however\nthis process was only meant to be used with text-based scripts (either\nwritten in Python or a shell scripting language). To work around this problem\n(which really only impacts the few core afdko developers who need to get live\nfeedback as they modify the source files) you can use alternative methods like\nexporting a PYTHONPATH, using a .pth file or similar hacks.\nFor further details read [this comment](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/pull/677#issuecomment-436747212).\n\nMajor changes from version 2.5.x\n--------------------------------\n\n* The AFDKO has been restructured so that it can be installed as a Python\npackage. It now depends on the user's Python interpreter, and no longer\ncontains its own Python interpreter.\n\n* Two programs, **IS** and **checkoutlines** were dropped because their source\ncode could not be open-sourced. These tools are available in [release version\n2.5.65322 and older](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/releases?after=2.6.22).\n\n**Note**\n\nIf you install the old AFDKO as well as the new PyPI afdko package, the tools from\nthe newer version will take precedence over the older. This happens because pip\nadds the afdko's package path at the beginning of the system's PATH environment\nvariable, whereas the old installer adds it at the end; this modification to PATH\nis not undone by the uninstaller. If you want to completely remove the path to the\nnewer version, you will have to edit the PATH. On the Mac, this means editing the\nline in your login file that sets the PATH variable. On Windows, this means editing\nthe PATH environment variable in the system's Control Panel.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n3.3.0 (released 2020-05-01)\n---------------------------\n- [otf2ttf] update LSB

It now depends on the user's Python interpreter, and no\nlonger contains its own Python interpreter.\n\nIn order to do this, the two Adobe-owned, non-opensource programs were\ndropped: `IS` and `checkOutlines`. If these turn out to be sorely\nmissed, an installer for them will be added to the old Adobe afdko\nwebsite. The current intent is to migrate the many tests in\ncheckOutlines to the newer `checkOutlinesUFO` (which does work with\nOpenType and Type 1 fonts, but currently does only overlap detection and\nremoval, and a few basic path checks).\n\nOlder releases can be downloaded from the [repository's Releases\npage](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/releases?after=2.6.22).\n\n2.5.66097 (released 2017-12-01)\n-------------------------------\n\nThis only lists the major bug fixes since the last release. For a\ncomplete list see:\n<https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/commits/master>\n\n- [buildCFF2VF] Add version check for fontTools module: only\n  starting with version 3.19.0 does fontTools.cffLib build correct\n  PrivateDict BlueValues when there are master source fonts not at the\n  ends of the axes.\n- [makeotfexe] Support mapping a glyph to several Unicode values.\n  This can now be done by providing the the UV values as a\n  comma-separated list in the third field of the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB\n  file, in the 'uniXXXXX' format.\n- [makeotfexe] Fixed a crashing bug that can happen when the\n  features file contains duplicate class kern pairs. Reported by\n  Andreas Seidel in email.\n- [makeotfexe] Add fatal messages if a feature file 'cvParameters'\n  block is used in anything other than a Character Variant (cvXX)\n  feature, or if a 'featureNames' block is used in anything other\n  than a Stylistic Set (ssXX) feature.\n- [makeotfexe] Relaxed restrictions on name table name IDs. Only 2\n  and 6 are now reserved for the implementation.\n- [makeotfexe] Fixed bug where use of the 'size' feature in\n  conjunction with named stylistic alternates would cause the last\n  stylistic alternate name to be replaced by the size feature menu\n  name. Incidentally removed old patent notices.\n- [makeotfexe] Restored old check for the fatal error of two\n  different glyphs being mapped to the same character encoding.\n- [makeotfexe] If the last line of a GOADB file did not end in a\n  new-line, makeotf quit, saying the line was too long.\n- [otf2otc] Can now take a single font as input, and can take an OTC\n  font as input.\n- [sfntdiff] Fixed old bug: it used to crash if no file path or only\n  one file path was provided.\n- [sfntdiff] Changed behavior: it now returns non-zero only if a\n  real error occurs; it used to return non-zero when there was a\n  difference between the fonts.\n- [spot] Fixed old bug: a PrivateDict must exist, but it is legal\n  for it to have a length of 0.\n- [tx *et al.*] Add support for reading and writing blended hints\n  from/to CFF2.\n\n2.5.65811 (released 2017-04-27)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [makeInstancesUFO] Preserve public.postscriptNames lib key.\n- [makeInstancesUFO] Do not use postscriptFontName attribute.\n- [makeotf] New option -V to print MakeOTF.py script version.\n- [tx] Added new option '-maxs', to set the maximum number of\n  subroutines allowed. The default is now 32K, as some legacy systems\n  cannot support more than this.\n- [tx] Add improved CFF2 support: tx can now use the option -cff2 to\n  write from a CFF2 font (in a complete OpenType font) to a file\n  containing the output CFF2 table, with full charstring optimization\n  and subroutinization. This last option is still work in progress: it\n  has not been extensively tested, and does yet support blended hints.\n- [tx] Several bug fixes for overlap removal.\n- [tx] Fixed bug in subroutinization that could leave a small number\n  of unused subroutines in the font. This cleanup is optional, as it\n  requires 3x the processing speed with the option than without, and\n  typically reduces the font size by less than 0.5 percent.\n- [ttxn] Option '-nv' will now print name IDs 3 and 5, but with\n  the actual version number replaced by the string \"VERSION\n  SUPPRESSED\".\n- [ufoTools] FIx autohint bug with UFO fonts: if edit a glyph and\n  re-hint, autohint uses old processed layer glyph.\n\n2.5.65781 (released 2017-04-03)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [variable fonts] **buildMasterOTFs** new script to build OTF font\n  files from UFO sources, when building variable fonts.\n- [variable fonts] **buildCFF2VF** new command to build a CFF2\n  variable font from the master OTF fonts.\n- [autohint] Fixed bug introduced by typo on Dec 1 2015. Caused\n  BlueFuzz to always be set to 1. Rarely causes problems, but found it\n  with font that sets BlueFuzz to zero; with BlueFuzz set to 1, some\n  of the alignment zones were filtered out as being closer than\n  BlueFuzz\\*3.\n- [autohint] Fixed long-standing bug with UFO fonts where if a glyph\n  was edited after being hinted, running autohint would process and\n  output only the old version of the glyph from the processed layer.\n- [CheckOutlinesUFO] Added \"quiet mode\" option.\n- [CheckOutlinesUFO] Fixed a bug where logic could try and set an\n  off-curve point as a start point.\n- [CheckOutlinesUFO] Changed the logic for assigning contour order\n  and start point. The overlap removal changes both, and\n  checkOutlinesUFO makes some attempt to restore the original state\n  when possible. These changes will result in different contour order\n  and start points than before the change, but fixes a bug, and will\n  usually produce the same contour order and start point in fonts that\n  are generated as instances from a set of master designs. There will\n  always be cases where there will be some differences.\n- [MakeOTF] Replace old logic for deriving relative paths with\n  python function for the same.\n- [MakeOTF] When converting Type 1 to CID in makeotf, the logic in\n  mergeFonts and ConvertFontToCID.py was requiring the FDArray\n  FontDicts to have keys, like FullName, that are not in fact\n  required, and are often not present in the source fonts. Fixed both\n  mergeFonts and ConvertFontToCID.py.\n- [MakeOTF] By default, makeotf will add a minimal stub DSIG table\n  in release mode. The new options '-addDSIG' and '-omitDSIG' will\n  force makeotf to either add or omit the stub DSIG table. This\n  function was added because the Adobe Type group is discontinuing\n  signing font files.\n- [makeotfexe] Fixed bug in processing UVS input file for makeotf\n  for non-CID fonts.\n- [makeotfexe] Fixed bug where makeotf would reject a nameID 25\n  record when specified in a feature file. This nameID value used to\n  be reserved, but is now used for overriding the postscript family\n  named used with arbitrary instances in variable fonts.\n- [mergeFonts] Removed requirement for mergeFonts that each FontDict\n  have a FullName, Weight, and Family Name. This fixes a bug in using\n  mergeFonts with UFO sources and converting to CID-keyed output font.\n  Developers should not have to put these fields in the source fonts,\n  since they are not required.\n- [spot] Fixed bug in name table dump: Microsoft platform language\n  tags for Big5 and PRC were swapped.\n- [stemHist] Removed debug print line, that caused a lot of annoying\n  output, and was left in the last update by accident.\n- [tx] When getting Unicode values for output, the presence of UVS\n  cmap meant that no UV values were read from any other cmap subtable.\n  I fixed this bug, but 'tx' still does not support reading and\n  showing UVS values. Doing so will be a significant amount of work,\n  so I am deferring that to my next round of FDK work.\n- [tx] Added support for CFF2 variable fonts as source fonts: when\n  using -t1 or -cff, these will be snapshotted to an instance. If no\n  user design vector (UDV) argument is supplied, then the output will\n  be the default data. If a UDV argument is supplied with the option\n  -U, then the instance is built at the specified point in the design\n  space.\n- [tx] Added new option +V/-V to remove overlaps in output Type 1\n  fonts (mode -t1) and CFF fonts (mode -cff). This is still\n  experimental.\n- [tx] Made the subroutinizer a lot faster; the speed bump is quite\n  noticeable with CJK fonts. (by Ariza Michiharu)\n- [tx] Added new option (+V/-V) to remove overlaps. (by Ariza\n  Michiharu)\n- [ttx] Updated to version 3.9.1 of the fontTools module from master\n  branch on GitHub.\n\n2.5.65322 (released 2016-05-27)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [CMAP files] Updated UniCNS-UTF32-H to v1.14\n- [build] Made changes to allow compiling under Xcode 7.x and OSX\n  10.11\n- [documentation] Fixed a bunch of errors in the Feature File spec.\n  My thanks to Sascha Brawer, who has been reviewing it carefully. See\n  the issues at\n  <https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/issues/created_by/brawer>.\n- [autohint] Fixed support for history file, which can be used with\n  non-UFO fonts only. This has been broken since UFO support was\n  added.\n- [autohintexe] Fixed really old bug: ascenders and descenders get\n  dropped from the alignment zone report if they are a) not in an\n  alignment zone and b) there is an overlapping smaller stem hint.\n  This happened with a lot of descenders.\n- [checkOutlines] Fixed bug in ufoTools.py that kept checkOutlines\n  (NOT checkOutlinesUFO) from working with a UFO font.\n- [checkOutlines] Fixed bug which misidentified orientation of path\n  which is very thin and in part convex. I am a bit concerned about\n  the solution, as what I did was to delete some logic that was used\n  to double-check the default rules for determining orientation.\n  However, the default logic is the standard way to determine\n  orientation and should always be correct. The backup logic was\n  definitely not always correct as it was applied only to a single\n  point, and was correct only if the curve associated with the point\n  is concave. It is in fact applied at several different points on a\n  path, with the majority vote winning. Since the backup logic is used\n  only when a path is very thin, I suspect that it was a sloppy\n  solution to fix a specific case. The change was tested with several\n  large fonts, and found no false positives.\n- [makeInstances] Fixed bug which produced distorted shapes for\n  those glyphs which were written with the Type 1 'seac' operator,\n  a.k.a. Type 1 composite glyphs.\n- [makeotfexe] Fixed bug where using both kern format A and B in a\n  single lookup caused random values to be assigned.\n- [makeotfexe] Fixed bug where a format A kern value (a single\n  value) would be applied to X positioning rather than Y positioning\n  for the features 'vkrn'. Applied same logic to vpal, valt, and\n  vhal.\n- [makeotfexe] Finally integrated Georg Seifert's code for\n  supporting hyphen in development glyph names. This version differs\n  from Georg's branch in that it does not allow any of the special\n  characters in final names (i.e. the left side names in the\n  GlyphAliasAndOrderDB). However, allowing this is a smaller tweak\n  than it used to be: just use the same arguments in\n  `cb.c:gnameFinalScan()` as in `gnameDevScan()`. This update also\n  includes Georg's changes for allow source fonts to have CID names\n  in the form 'cidNNNN'.\n- [ConvertToCID] Fixed bug that the script expected in several\n  places that the fontinfo file would contain at least one user\n  defined FontDict.\n- [ConvertToCID] Fixed bug that the script expected that the source\n  font would have Weight and Adobe Copyright fields in the font dict.\n- [makeotf] Fixed a bug that kept the '-nS' option for having any\n  effect when the '-cn' option is used.\n- [makeotfexe] Remove use of 'strsep()'; function is not defined\n  in the Windows C library.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug in removing duplicate and conflicting entries.\n  Changed logic to leave the first pair defined out of a set of\n  duplicate or conflicting entries.\n- [makeotfexe] Fixed bug in processing GDEF glyph class statements:\n  if multiple GlyphClass statements were used; the additional glyphs\n  were added to a new set of 4 glyph classes, rather than merged with\n  the allowed 4 glyph classes.\n- [makeotfexe] Fixed issue in GDEF definition processing. Made it an\n  error to specify both LigCaretByPosition and LigCaretByIndex for a\n  glyph.\n- [makeotfexe] Corrected error message: language and system\n  statements are allowed in named lookups within a feature definition,\n  but are not allowed in stand-alone lookups.\n- [makeotf] Corrected typo in MakeOTF.py help text about what the\n  default source font path.\n- [makeotfexe] Fixed an old bug in makeotf. If a mark-to-base or\n  mark-to-mark lookup has statements that do not all reference the\n  same mark classes, makeotfexe used to write a 'default' anchor\n  attachment point of (0.0) for any mark class that was not referenced\n  by a given statement. Fixed this bug by reporting a fatal error: the\n  feature file must be re-written so that all the statements in a\n  lookup must all reference the same set of mark classes.\n- [makeotf] Suppressed warning about not using GOADB file when\n  building a CID font. Some of the changes I made a few weeks ago to\n  allow building fonts with CIDs specified as glyphs names with the\n  form 'cidNNNNN' allowed this warning to be be shown, but it is not\n  appropriate for CID-keyed fonts.\n- [makeotf] Fixed old bug where using option -'cn' to convert a\n  non-CID source font to CID would cause a mismatch between the maxp\n  table number of glyphs and the number of glyph actually in the output\n  font, because the conversion used the source font data rather than\n  the first pass name-keyed OTF which had been subject to glyph\n  subsetting with the GOADB file.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug in reading UVS files for non\\_CID fonts.\n- Fixed copyright statements that are incompatible with the open\n  source license. Thanks to Dmitry Smirnov for pointing these out.\n  These were in some make files, an example Adobe CMAP file, and some\n  of the technical documentation.\n- Fixed typos in help text in ProofPDF.py. Thank you Arno Enslin.\n- [ttxn] Fixed bug in ttxn.py that broke it when dumping some\n  tables, when used with latest fontTools library.\n- [tx] Fixed bug in rounding fractional values when flattening\n  library elements, used in design of CJK fonts.\n- [tx] Fixed bug in handling FontDict FontMatrix array values: not\n  enough precision was used, so that 1/2048 was written as 1/2049 in\n  some cases.\n- [tx] Fixed bug in reading UFO fonts, so that glyphs with no\n  `<outline>` element and with a `<lib>` element would be skipped.\n- [tx] Minor code changes to allow 'tx' to compile as a 64 bit\n  program.\n- [tx] Fixed bug in dumping AFM format data, introduced when tx was\n  updated to be 64 bit.\n- [tx] Fixed bug in processing seac, introduced in work on rounding\n  fractional values.\n- [tx] Fixed bug in writing AFM files: -1 value would be written as\n  4294967295 instead of -1.\n- [tx] Added option -noOpt, renamed blend operator from 'reserved'\n  to 'blend'. This was done in order to support experiments with\n  multiple master fonts.\n- [tx] When reading a UFO font: if it has no Postscript version\n  entry, set the version to 1.0.\n- [tx] When writing a UFO font: if StemSnap[H,V] are missing, but\n  Std[H,V]W are present, use the Std[H,V]W values to supply the\n  UFO's postscript StemSnap[H,V] values.\n- [tx] Fixed old bug with rounding decimal values for BlueScale is\n  one of the few Postscript values with several places of decimal\n  precision. It is stored as an ASCII text decimal point number in T1,\n  T2, and UFO files, but is stored internally as a C 'float' value\n  in some programs. Real values in C cannot exactly represent all\n  decimal values. For example, the closest that a C 'float' value\n  can come to \"0.375\" is \"0.03750000149\".When writing output\n  fonts, tx was writing out the latter value in ASCII text, rather\n  than rounding back to 0.0375. Fixed by rounding to 8 decimal places\n  on writing the value out. This bug had no practical consequences, as\n  0.0375 and 0.03750000149 both convert to exactly the same float\n  value, but was annoying, and could cause rounding differences in any\n  programs that use higher precision fields to hold the BlueScale\n  value.\n\n2.5.65012 (released 2015-12-01)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug that kept makeotfexe from building fonts with\n  spaces in the path.\n- [ConvertFontToCID] Fixed bug that kept makeotf from converting UFO\n  fonts to CID.\n- [makeotf] Changed support for Unicode Variation Sequence file\n  (option '-ci') so that when used with name-keyed fonts, the\n  Region-Order field is omitted, and the glyph name may be either a\n  final name or developer glyph name. Added warning when glyph in the\n  UVS entry is not found in font. See MakeOTF User's Guide.\n- [makeotfexe] now always makes a cmap table subtable MS platform,\n  Unicode, format 4 for CID fonts. This is required by Windows. If\n  there are no BMP Unicode values, then it makes a stub subtable,\n  mapping GID 0 to UVS 0.\n- [tx *et al.*] When reading a UFO source font, do not complain if\n  the fontinfo.plist entry `styleName` is present but has an empty\n  string. This is valid, and is common when the style is **Regular**.\n\n2.5.64958 (released 2015-11-22)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [autohint/tx] Switched to using new text format that is\n  plist-compatible for T1 hint data in UFO fonts. See header of\n  ufoTools.py for format.\n- [autohint] Finally fixed excessive generation of flex hints. This\n  has been an issue for decades, but never got fixed because it did\n  not show up anywhere as a problem. The last version of makeotf\n  turned on parsing warnings, and so now we notice.\n- [checkOutlinesUFO] Fixed bug where abutting paths did not get\n  merged if there were no changes in the set of points.\n- [checkOutlinesUFO] Fixed bug where a `.glif` file without an\n  `<outline>` element was treated as fatal error. It is valid for the\n  `<outline>` element to be missing.\n- [checkOutlines] Changed -I option so that it also turns off\n  checking for tiny paths. Added new option -5 to turn this check back\n  on again.\n- [checkOutlinesUFO] Increased max number of paths in a glyph from\n  64 to 128, per request from a developer.\n- [CompareFamily] Fixed old bug in applying ligature width tests for\n  CID fonts, and fixed issue with fonts that do not have Mac name\n  table names. The logic now reports missing Mac name table names only\n  if there actually are some: if there are none, these messages are\n  suppressed.\n- [fontplot/waterfallplot/hintplot/fontsetplot] Fixed bugs that\n  prevented these from being used with CID-keyed fonts and UFO fonts.\n  Since the third party library that generates the PDF files is very\n  limited, I did this by simply converting the source files to a\n  name-keyed Type 1 temporary font file, and then applying the tools\n  the temporary file.\n- [makeInstancesUFO] Added a call to the ufonormalizer tool for each\n  instance. Also added a call to the defcon library to remove all\n  private lib keys from lib.py and each glyph in the default layer,\n  excepting only \"public.glyphOrder\".\n- Fixed typos in MakeOTF User Guide reported by Gustavo Ferreira\n- [MakeOTF] Increased max number of directories to look upwards when\n  searching for GOADB and FontMenuNameDB files from 2 to 3.\n- [MakeOTF/makeotfexe] Added three new options:\n\n  - `omitMacNames` and `useMacNames` write only Windows platform\n    menu names in name table, apart from the names specified in\n    the feature file. `useMacNames` writes Mac as well as\n    Windows names.\n  - `overrideMenuNames` allows feature file name table entries\n    to override default values and the values from the\n    FontMenuNameDB for name IDs. NameIDs 2 and 6 cannot be\n    overridden. Use this with caution, and make sure you have\n    provided feature file name table entries for all platforms.\n  - `skco`/`nskco` do/do not suppress kern class optimization by\n    using left side class 0 for non-zero kern values. Optimizing\n    saves a few hundred to thousand bytes, but confuses some\n    programs. Optimizing is the default behavior, and previously\n    was the only option.\n\n- [MakeOTF] Allow building an OTF from a UFO font only. The internal\n  `features.fea` file will be used if there is no `features` file in\n  the font's parent directory. If the GlyphAliasAndOrderDB file is\n  missing, only a warning will be issued. If the FontMenuNameDB is\n  missing, makeotf will attempt to build the font menu names from the\n  UFO fontinfo file, using the first of the following keys found:\n  `openTypeNamePreferredFamilyName`, `familyName`, the family name\n  part of the `postScriptName`, and finally the value\n  **NoFamilyName**. For style, the keys are:\n  `openTypeNamePreferredSubfamilyName`, `styleName`, the style name\n  part of the `postScriptName`, and finally the value **Regular**.\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed bug where it allowed the input and output file\n  paths to be the same.\n- [makeotfexe] Extended the set of characters allowed in glyph names\n  to include `+ * : ~ ^ !`.\n- [makeotfexe] Allow developer glyph names to start with numbers;\n  final names must still follow the PS spec.\n- [makeotfexe] Fixed crashing bug with more than 32K glyphs in a\n  name-keyed font, reported by Gustavo Ferreira.\n- [makeotfexe] Merged changes from Khaled Hosny, to remove\n  requirement that 'size' feature menu names have Mac platform\n  names.\n- [makeotfexe] Code maintenance in generation of the feature file\n  parser. Rebuilt the 'antler' parser generator to get rid of a\n  compile-time warning for zzerraction, and changed featgram.g so that\n  it would generate the current featgram.c, rather than having to edit\n  the latter directly. Deleted the object files for the 'antler'\n  parser generator, and updated the read-me for the parser generator.\n- [makeotfexe] Fixed really old bug: relative include file\n  references in feature files have not worked right since the FDK\n  moved from Mac OS 9 to OSX. They are now relative to the parent\n  directory of the including feature file. If that is not found, then\n  makeotf tries to apply the reference as relative to the main feature\n  file.\n- [spot] Fixed bug in dumping stylistic feature names.\n- [spot] Fixed bug proofing vertical features: needed to use vkern\n  values. Fix contributed by Hiroki Kanou.\n- [tx *et all.*] Fix crash when using '-gx' option with source UFO\n  fonts.\n- [tx *et all.*] Fix crash when a UFO glyph point has a name\n  attribute with an empty string.\n- [tx *et all.*] Fix crash when a UFO font has no public.glyphOrder\n  dict in the lib.plist file.\n- [tx *et all.*] Fix really old bug in reading TTF fonts, reported\n  by Belleve Invis. TrueType glyphs with nested component references\n  and x/y offsets or translation get shifted.\n- [tx *et all.*] Added new option '-fdx' to select glyphs by\n  excluding all glyphs with the specified FDArray indices. This and\n  the '-fd' option now take lists and ranges of indices, as well as\n  a single index value.\n- Added a command to call the ufonormalizer tool.\n- Updated to latest version of booleanOperatons, defcon (ufo3 branch),\n  fontMath (ufo3 branch), fontTools, mutatorMath, and robofab (ufo3\n  branch). The AFDKO no longer contains any private branches of third\n  party modules.\n- Rebuilt the Mac OSX, Linux and Windows Python interpreters in the\n  AFDKO, bringing the Python version up to 2.7.10. The Python\n  interpreters are now built for 64-bit systems, and will not run on\n  32-bit systems.\n\n2.5.64700 (released 2015-08-04)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [ufoTools] Fixed bug that was harmless but annoying. Every time\n  that `autohint -all` was run, it added a new program name entry to\n  the history list in the hashmap for each processed glyph. You saw\n  this only if you opened the hashmap file with a text editor, and\n  perhaps eventually in slightly slower performance.\n- [checkOutlinesUFO] Fixed bug where presence of outlines with only\n  one or two points caused a stack dump.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug reported by Paul van der Laan: failed to build\n  TTF file when the output file name contains spaces.\n- [spot] Fixed new bug that caused spot to crash when dumping GPOS\n  'size' feature in feature file format.\n\n2.5.64655 (released 2015-07-17)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [ufoTools] Fixed bug which placed a new hint block after a flex\n  operator, when it should be before.\n- [autohint] Fixed new bug in hinting non-UFO fonts, introduced by\n  the switch to absolute coordinates in the bez file interchange\n  format.\n- [ufoTools] Fixed bugs in using hashmap to detect previously hinted\n  glyphs.\n- [ufoTools] Fixed bugs in handling the issue that\n  checkOutlinesUFO.py (which uses the defcon library to write UFO glif\n  files) will in some cases write glif files with different file names\n  than they had in the default glyph layer.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug with Unicode values in the absolute path to to\n  the font home directory.\n- [makeotf] Add support for Character Variant (cvXX) feature params.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug where setting Italic style forced OS/2 version\n  to be 4.\n- [spot] Added support for cvXX feature params.\n- [spot] Fixed in crash in dumping long contextual substitution\n  strings, such as in 'GentiumPlus-R.TTF'.\n- [tx] Fixed bug in handling CID glyph ID greater than 32K.\n- [tx] Changed to write widths and FontBBox as integer values.\n- [tx] Changed to write SVG, UFO, and dump coordinates with 2 places\n  of precision when there is a fractional part.\n- [tx] Fixed bugs in handling the '-gx' option to exclude glyphs.\n  Fixed problem with CID \\> 32K. Fixed problem when font has 65536\n  glyphs: all glyphs after first last would be excluded.\n- [tx] Fixed rounding errors in writing out decimal values to cff\n  and t1 fonts.\n- [tx] Increased interpreter stack depth to allow for CUBE operators\n  (Library elements) with up to 9 blend axes.\n- Fixed Windows builds: had to provide a roundf() function, and more\n  includes for the \\_tmpFile function. Fixed a few compile errors.\n- Fixed bug in documentation for makeInstancesUFO.\n- Fixed bug in BezTools.py on Windows, when having to use a temp file.\n\n2.5.64261 (released 2015-05-26)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [autohintexe] Worked through a lot of problems with fractional\n  coordinates. In the previous release, autohintexe was changed to\n  read and write fractional values. However, internal value storage\n  used a Fixed format with only 7 bits of precision for the value.\n  This meant that underflow errors occurred with 2 decimal places,\n  leading to incorrect coordinates. I was able to fix this by changing\n  the code to use 8 bits of precision, which supports 2 decimal places\n  (but not more!) without rounding errors, but this required many\n  changes. The current autohint output will match the output of the\n  previous version for integer input values, with two exceptions.\n  Fractional stem values will (rarely) differ in the second decimal\n  place. The new version will also choose different hints in glyphs\n  which have coordinate values outside of the range -16256 to +16256;\n  the previous version had a bug in calculating weights for stems.\n- [autohint] Changed logic for writing bez files to write absolute\n  coordinate values instead of relative coordinate values. Fixed bug\n  where truncation of decimal values lead to cumulative errors in\n  positions adding up to more than 1 design unit over the length of a\n  path.\n- [tx] Fixed bugs in handling fractional values: `tx` had a bug with\n  writing fractional values that are very near an integer value for\n  the modes -dump, -svg, and -ufo. `tx` also always applied the logic\n  for applying a user transform matrix, even though the default\n  transform is the identity transform. This has the side-effect of\n  rounding to integer values.\n\n2.5.64043 (released 2015-04-08)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [checkOutlinesUFO] Added new logic to delete any glyphs from the\n  processed layer which are not in the 'glyphs' layer.\n- [makeotf] When building CID font, some error messages were printed\n  twice.\n- [makeotf] Added new option `stubCmap4`. This causes makeotf to\n  build only a stub cmap 4 subtable, with just two segments. Needed\n  only for special cases like AdobeBlank, where every byte is an\n  issue. Windows requires a cmap format 4 subtable, but not that it be\n  useful.\n- [makeCIDFont] Output FontDict was sized incorrectly. A function at\n  the end adds some FontInfo keys, but did not increment the size of\n  the dict. Legacy logic is to make the FontInfo dict be 3 larger than\n  the current number of keys.\n- [makeInstanceUFO] Changed AFDKO's branch of mutatorMath so that\n  kern values, glyph widths, and the BlueValues family of global hint\n  values are all rounded to integer even when the `decimal` option is\n  used.\n- [makeInstanceUFO] Now deletes the default 'glyphs' layer of the\n  target instance font before generating the instance. This solves the\n  problem that when glyphs are removed from the master instances, the\n  instance font still has them.\n- [makeInstanceUFO] Added a new logic to delete any glyphs from the\n  processed layer which are not in the 'glyphs' layer.\n- [makeInstanceUFO] Removed the `all` option: even though\n  mutatorMath rewrites all the glyphs, the hash values are still valid\n  for glyphs which have not been edited. This means that if the\n  developer edits only a few glyphs in the master designs, only those\n  glyphs in the instances will get processed by checkOutlinesUFO and\n  autohint.\n- Support fractional coordinate values in UFO workflow:\n\n  - checkOutlinesUFO (but not checkOutlines), autohint, and\n    makeInstancesUFO will now all pass through decimal\n    coordinates without rounding, if you use the new option\n    \"decimal\". tx will dump decimal values with 3 decimal\n    places.\n  - tx already reported fractional values, but needed to be\n    modified to report only 3 decimal places when writing UFO\n    glif files, and in PDF output mode: Acrobat will not read\n    PDF files with 9 decimal places in position values.\n  - This allows a developer to use a much higher precision of\n    point positioning without using a larger em-square. The\n    Adobe Type group found that using an em-square of other than\n    1000 design units still causes problems in layout and text\n    selection line height in many apps, despite it being legal\n    by the Type 1 and CFF specifications.\n  - Note that code design issues in autohint currently limit the\n    decimal precision and accuracy to 2 decimal places: 1.01\n    works but 1.001 will be rounded to 0.\n\n2.5.63782 (released 2015-03-03)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [tx] Fix bug in reading TTFs. Font version was taken from the name\n  table, which can include a good deal more than just the font\n  version. Changed to read fontRevision from the head table.\n- [detype1] Changed to wrap line only after an operator name, so\n  that the coordinates for a command and the command name would stay\n  on one line.\n- [otf2otc] Pad table data with zeros so as to align tables on a 4\n  boundary. Submitted by Cosimo Lupo.\n\n2.5.63718 (released 2015-02-21)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [ufoTools] Fixed a bug with processing flex hints that caused\n  outline distortion.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed bug in processing hints: it would miss\n  fractional hints, and so falsely report a glyph as having no hints.\n- [compareFamily] Support processing CFF font without a FullName\n  key.\n- [checkOutlinesUFO] Coordinates are written as integers, as well as\n  being rounded.\n- [checkOutlinesUFO] Changed save function so that only the\n  processed glyph layer is saved, and the default layer is not\n  touched.\n- [checkOutlinesUFO] Changed so that XML type is written as\n  'UTF-8' rather than 'utf-8'. This was actually a change in the\n  FontTools xmlWriter.py module.\n- [checkOutlinesUFO] Fixed typos in usage and help text.\n- [checkOutlinesUFO] Fixed hash dictionary handling so that it will\n  work with autohint, when skipping already processed glyphs.\n- [checkOutlinesUFO] Fixed false report of overlap removal when only\n  change was removing flat curve\n- [checkOutlinesUFO] Fixed stack dump when new glyph is seen which\n  is not in hash map of previously processed glyphs.\n- [checkOutlinesUFO] Added logic to make a reasonable effort to sort\n  the new glyph contours in the same order as the source glyph\n  contours, so the final contour order will not depend on (x,y)\n  position. This was needed because the pyClipper library (which is\n  used to remove overlaps) otherwise sorts the contours in (x,y)\n  position order, which can result in different contour order in\n  different instance fonts from the same set of master fonts.\n- [makeInstancesUFO] Changed so that the option -i (selection of\n  which instances to build) actually works.\n- [makeInstancesUFO] Removed dependency on the presence of\n  instance.txt file.\n- [makeInstancesUFO] Changed to call checkOutlinesUFO rather than\n  checkOutlines\n- [makeInstancesUFO] Removed hack of converting all file paths to\n  absolute file paths: this was a work-around for a bug in\n  robofab-ufo3k that is now fixed.\n- [makeInstancesUFO] Removed all references to old instances.txt\n  meta data file.\n- [makeInstancesUFO] Fixed so that current dir does not have to be\n  the parent dir of the design space file.\n- Merged fixes from the GitHub AFDKO open source repo.\n- Updated to latest version defcon, fontMath, robofab, and\n  mutatorMath.\n- Fix for Yosemite (Mac OSX 10.10) in FDK/Tools/setFDKPaths. When an\n  AFDKO script is ran from another Python interpreter, such as the one\n  in RoboFont, the parent Python interpreter may set the Unix\n  environment variables PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH. This can cause the\n  AFDKO Python interpreter to load some modules from its own library,\n  and others from the parent interpreters library. If these are\n  incompatible, a crash ensues. The fix is to unset the variables\n  PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH before the AFDKO interpreter is called.\n  Note: As a separate issue, under Mac OSX 10.10, Python calls to FDK\n  commands will only work if the calling app is run from the\n  command-line (e.g: `open /Applications/RoboFont.app`), and the\n  argument `shell=\"True\"` is added to the subprocess module call to\n  open a system command. I favor also adding the argument\n  `stderr=subprocess.STDOUT`, else you will not see error messages\n  from the Unix shell. Example:\n  `log = subprocess.check_output( \"makeotf -u\", stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, shell=True)`.\n\n2.5.63408 (released 2014-12-02)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [spot] Fixed error message in GSUB chain contextual 3 proof file\n  output; was adding it as a shell comment to the proof output,\n  causing conversion to PDF to fail.\n- [makeotf] Increased the limit for glyph name length from 31 to 63\n  characters. This is not encouraged in shipping fonts, as there may\n  be text engines that will not accept glyphs with more than 31\n  characters. This was done to allow building test fonts to look for\n  such cases.\n\n2.5.63209 (released 2014-09-18)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [makeInstancesUFO] Added new script to build instance fonts from\n  UFO master design fonts. This uses the design space XML file\n  exported by Superpolator 3 in order to define the design space, and\n  the location of the masters and instance fonts in the design space.\n  The definition of the format of this file, and the library to use\n  the design space file data, is in the open source mutatorMath\n  library on GitHub, and maintained by Erik van Blokland. There are\n  several advantages of the Superpolator design space over the\n  previous **makeInstances** script, which uses the Type 1 Multiple\n  Master font format to hold the master designs. The new version a)\n  allows different master designs and locations for each glyph, and b)\n  allows master designs to be arbitrarily placed in the design space,\n  and hence allows intermediate masters. In order to use the\n  mutatorMath library, the AFDKO-supplied Python now contains the\n  robofab, fontMath, and defcon libraries, as well as mutatorMath.\n- [ttx] Updated to the latest branch of the fontTools library as\n  maintained by Behdad Esfahbod on GitHub. Added a patch to cffLib.py\n  to fix a minor problem with choosing charset format with large glyph\n  sets.\n- Updated four Adobe-CNS1-\\* ordering files.\n\n2.5.63164 (released 2014-09-08)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [makeotf] Now detects `IsOS/2WidthWeightSlopeOnly` as well as the\n  misspelled `IsOS/2WidthWeigthSlopeOnly`, when processing the\n  fontinfo file.\n- [makeotfexe] Changed behavior when 'subtable' keyword is used in\n  a lookup other than class kerning. This condition now triggers only\n  a warning, not a fatal error. Change requested by FontForge\n  developers.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug which prevented making TTF fonts under\n  Windows. This was a problem in quoting paths used with the 'ttx'\n  program.\n- Fixed installation issues: removed old Windows install files from\n  the Windows AFDKOPython directory. This was causing installation of\n  a new AFDKO version under Windows to fail when the user's PATH\n  environment variable contained the path to the AFDKOPython\n  directory. Also fixed command file for invoking ttx.py.\n- Updated files used for building ideographic fonts with Unicode IVS\n  sequences:\n  `FDK/Tools/SharedData/Adobe Cmaps/Adobe-CNS1/Adobe-CNS1_sequences.txt`\n  and `Adobe-Korea1_sequences.txt`.\n\n2.5.62754 (released 2014-05-14)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [IS/addGlobalColor] When using the '-bc' option, fixed bug with\n  overflow for CID value in dumping glyph header. Fixed bug in IS to\n  avoid crash when logic for glyphs \\> 72 points is used.\n- [makeotfexe] Fixed bug that applied '-gs' option as default\n  behavior, subsetting the source font to the list of glyphs in the\n  GOADB.\n\n2.5.62690 (released 2014-04-30)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [makeotf] When building output TTF font from an input TTF font,\n  will now suppress warnings that hints are missing. Added a new\n  option '-shw' to suppress these warnings for other fonts that with\n  unhinted glyphs. These warnings are shown only when the font is\n  built in release mode.\n- [makeotfexe] If the cmap format 4 UTF16 subtable is too large to\n  write, then makeotfexe writes a stub subtable with just the first\n  two segments. The last two versions allowed using '-' in glyph\n  names. Removed this, as it breaks using glyph tag ranges in feature\n  files.\n- Updated copyright, and removed patent references. Made extensive\n  changes to the source code tree and build process, to make it easier\n  to build the open source AFDKO. Unfortunately, the source code for\n  the **IS** and **checkOutlines** programs cannot be open sourced.\n- [tx/mergeFonts/rotateFont] Removed '-bc' option support, as\n  this includes patents that cannot be shared in open source.\n- [tx] All tx-related tools now report when a font exceeds the max\n  allowed subroutine recursion depth.\n- [tx/mergeFonts/rotateFont] Added common options to all when\n  possible: all now support UFO and SVG fonts, the '-gx' option to\n  exclude fonts, the '-std' option for cff output, and the '-b'\n  option for cff output.\n\n2.5.61944 (released 2014-04-05)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [makeotf] Added new option '-gs'. If the '-ga' or '-r'\n  option is used, then '-gs' will omit from the font any glyphs\n  which are not named in the GOADB file.\n- [Linux] Replaced the previous build (which worked only on 64-bit\n  systems) with a 32 bit version, and rebuilt checkOutlines with debug\n  messages turned off.\n- [ttx] Fixed FDK/Tools/win/ttx.cmd file so that the 'ttx' command\n  works again.\n\n2.5.61911 (released 2014-03-25)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [makeotf] Add support for two new 'features' file keywords, for\n  the OS/2 table. Specifying 'LowerOpSize' and 'UpperOpSize' now\n  sets the values 'usLowerOpticalPointSize' and\n  'usUpperOpticalPointSize' in the OS/2 table, and set the table\n  version to 5.\n- [makeotf] Fixed the '-newNameID4' option so that if the style\n  name is \"Regular\", it is omitted for the Windows platform name ID\n  4, as well as in the Mac platform version. See change in\n  build 61250.\n- [tx] When the user does not specify an output destination file\n  path (in which case tx tries to write to stdout), tx now reports a\n  fatal error if the output is a UFO font, rather than crashing.\n- [tx] Fixed crash when encountering an empty `<dict/>` XML\n  element.\n- [spot] Added logic to dump the new fields in OS/2 table version 5,\n  **usLowerOpticalPointSize** and **usUpperOpticalPointSize**. An\n  example of these values can be seen in the Windows 8 system font\n  Sitka.TTC.\n- [ufo workflow] Fixed autohint and checkOutlines so that the '-o'\n  option works, by copying the source UFO font to the destination UFO\n  font name, and then running the program on the destination UFO font.\n- [ufo workflow] Fixed tools that the PostScript font name is not\n  required.\n- Added Linux build.\n\n2.5.61250 (released 2014-02-17)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [tx] Fixed rare crashing bug in reading a font file, where a\n  charstring ends exactly on a refill buffer boundary.\n- [tx] Fixed rare crashing bug in subroutinization.\n- [tx] Fixed bug where it reported values for wrong glyph with more\n  than 32K glyphs in the font.\n- [tx] Fixed bug where the tool would not dump a TrueType Collection\n  font file that contained OpenType/CFF fonts.\n- [tx] Fixed issue where it failed to read a UFO font if the UFO\n  font lacked a fontinfo.plist file, or a psFontName entry.\n- [IS] Fixed IS so that it no longer scales the fontDict FontMatrix,\n  when a scale factor is supplied, unless you provide an argument to\n  request this.\n- [makeotf] The option '-newNameID4' now builds both Mac and Win\n  name ID 4 using name ID 1 and 2, as specified in the OpenType spec.\n  The style name is omitted from name ID 4 it is \"Regular\".\n- [makeotf] Changed logic for specifying ValueFormat for PosPair\n  value records. Previous logic always used the minimum ValueFormat.\n  Since changing ValueFormat between one PosPair record and the next\n  requires starting a new subtable, feature files that used more than\n  one position adjustment in a PosPair value record often got more\n  subtable breaks then necessary, especially when specifying a PairPos\n  statement with an all zero Value Record value after a PairPos\n  statement with a non-zero Value Record. With the new logic, if the\n  minimum ValueFormat for the new ValueRecord is different than the\n  ValueFormat used with the ValueRecord for the previous PairPos\n  statement, and the previous ValueFormat permits expressing all the\n  values in the current ValueRecord, then the previous ValueFormat is\n  used for the new ValueRecord.\n- Added commands **otc2otf** and **otf2otc** to build OpenType\n  collection files from a OpenType font files, and vice-versa.\n- [ttx] Updated the FontTools library to the latest build on the\n  GitHub branch maintained by Behdad Esfahbod, as of Jan 14 2014.\n- [ufo workflow] Fixed bugs in ufoTools.py. The glyph list was being\n  returned in alphabetic order, even when the public.glyphOrder key\n  was present in lib.py. Failed when the glyphOrder key was missing.\n\n2.5.60908 (released 2013-10-21)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [tx] Can now take UFO font as a source font file for all outputs\n  except rasterization. It prefers GLIF file from the layer\n  `glyphs.com.adobe.type.processedGlyphs`. You can select another\n  preferred layer with the option '-altLayer `<layer name>`'. Use\n  'None' for the layer name in order to have tx ignore the preferred\n  layer and read GLIF files only from the default layer.\n- [tx] Can now write to a UFO with the option '-ufo'. Note that it\n  is NOT a full UFO writer. It writes only the information from the\n  Postscript font data. If the source is an OTF or TTF font, it will\n  not copy any of the meta data from outside the font program table.\n  Also, if the destination is an already existing UFO font, tx will\n  overwrite it with the new data: it will not merge the new font data\n  with the old.\n- [tx] Fixed bugs with CID values \\> 32K: used to write these as\n  negative numbers when dumping to text formats such as AFM.\n- [autohint/checkOutlines] These programs can now be used with UFO\n  fonts. When the source is a UFO font, the option '-o' to write to\n  another font is not permitted. The changed GLIF files are written to\n  the layer 'glyphs.com.adobe.type.processedGlyphs'. Each script\n  maintains a hash of the width and marking path operators in order to\n  be able to tell if the glyph data in the default layer has changed\n  since the script was last run. This allows the scripts to process\n  only those glyphs which have changed since the last run. The first\n  run of autohint can take two minutes for a 2000 glyph font; the\n  second run takes less then a second, as it does not need to process\n  the unchanged glyphs.\n- [stemHist/makeotf] Can now take UFO fonts as source fonts.\n\n2.5.60418 (released 2013-02-26)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [autohint] Now skips comment lines in fontinfo file.\n- [makeotf] Added support for source font files in the 'detype1'\n  plain text format. Added logic for \"Language\" keyword in fontinfo\n  file; if present, will attempt to set the CID font makeotf option\n  -\"cs\" to set he Mac script value.\n- [compareFamily] Added check in Family Test 10 that font really is\n  monospaced or not when either the FontDict isFixedPitch value or the\n  Panose value says that it is monospaced.\n- [spot] Fixed bug that kept 'palt'/'vpal' features from being\n  applied when proofing kerning.\n\n2.5.59149 (released 2012-10-31)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [makeotf] When building OpenType/TTF files, changed logic to copy\n  the OS/2 table usWinAscent/Descent values over the head table\n  yMax/yMin values, if different. This was because:\n\n  - both pairs are supposed to represent the real font bounding box\n    top and bottom,and should be equal;\n  - the TTF fonts we use as sources for makeotf are built by FontLab;\n  - FontLab defines the font bounding box for TrueType fonts by using\n    off-curve points as well as on-curve points. If a path does not have\n    on-curve points at the top and bottom extremes, the font bounding\n    box will end up too large. The OS/2 table usWinAscent/Descent\n    values, however, are set by makeotf using the converted T1 paths,\n    and are more accurate. Note that I do not try to fix the head table\n    xMin and xMax. These are much less important, as the head table yMin\n    and yMax values are used for line layout by many apps on the Mac,\n    and I know of no application for the xMin and yMin values.\n\n- [makeotf] Changed default Unicode H CMAP file for Adobe-Japan1 CID\n  fonts to use the UniJIS2004-UTF32-H file.\n- Added the CID font vertical layout files used with KozMinPr6N and\n  KozGoPr6N: AJ16-J16.VertLayout.KozGo and AJ16-J16.VertLayout.KozMin.\n- Updated several Unicode CMAP files, used only with CID fonts.\n- Added new Perl script, glyph-list.pl, used in building CID fonts.\n  This replaces the three scripts extract-cids.pl, extract-gids.pl,\n  and extract-names.pl, which have been removed from the AFDKO.\n\n2.5.58807 (released 2012-09-13)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [makeotf] Discovered that when building TTF fonts, the GDEF table\n  was not being copied to the final TTF font file. Fixed.\n\n2.5.58732 (released 2012-09-04)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [autohint] Added new feature to support sets of glyphs with\n  different baselines. You can now specify several different sets of\n  global alignment zones and stem widths, and apply them to particular\n  sets of glyphs within a font when hinting. See option '-hfd' for\n  documentation.\n- [autohint] Allow AC to handle fonts with no BlueValues, aka\n  alignment zones.\n- [autohint] Respect BlueFuzz value in font.\n- [autohint] Fixed the options to suppress hint substitution and to\n  allow changes.\n- [autohint] When hinting a font with no alignment zones or invalid\n  alignment zones (and with the '-nb' option), set the arbitrary\n  alignment zone outside the FontBBox, rather than the em-square.\n- [checkOutlines] Fixed bug where the arms of an X would be falsely\n  identified as coincident paths, when they are formed by only two\n  paths with identical bounding boxes.\n- [checkOutlines] Fixed bug where very thin elements would get\n  identified as a tiny sub path, and get deleted.\n- [checkOutlines] Fixed bug in determining path orientation. Logic\n  was just following the on-path points, and could get confused by\n  narrow concave inner paths, like parentheses with an inner contour\n  following the outer contour, as in the Cheltenham Std HandTooled\n  faces.\n- [checkOutlines] Fixed bugs in determining path orientation.\n  Previous logic did not handle multiple inner paths, or multiple\n  contained outer paths. Logic was also dependent on correctly sorting\n  paths by max Y of path bounding box. Replaced approximations with\n  real bezier math to determine path bounding box accurately.\n- [checkOutlines] Changed test for suspiciously large bounding box\n  for an outline. Previous test checked for glyph bounding box outside\n  of fixed limits that were based on a 1000 em square. The new test\n  looks only for paths that are entirely outside a rectangle based on\n  the font's em square, and only reports them: it does not ever\n  delete them. Added new option '-b' to set the size of the design\n  square used for the test.\n- [checkOutlines] Fixed bug where it would leave a temp file on disk\n  when processing a Type 1 font.\n- [checkOutlines] Removed test for coincident control points. This\n  has not been an issue for decades. It is frequently found in fonts\n  because designers may choose to not use one of the two control\n  points on a curve. The unused control point then has the same\n  coordinates as its nearest end-point, and would to cause\n  checkOutlines to complain.\n- [compareFamily] Single Test 6. Report error if there is a patent\n  number in the copyright. Adobe discovered that a company can be sued\n  if it ships any product with an expired patent number.\n- [compareFamily] Single Test 22 (check RSB and LSB of ligature vs.\n  the left and right ligature components) did not parse contextual\n  ligature substitution rules correctly. Now fixed.\n- [compareFamily] Family Test 18. Survive OTF fonts with no blue\n  values.\n- [compareFamily] Family Test 2 (Check that the Compatible Family\n  group has same nameIDs in all languages): Added the WPF nameIDs 21\n  and 22 to the exception list, which may not exist in all faces of a\n  family.\n- [fontsetplot] Fixed so it works with CID fonts. Also fixed so that\n  widow line control works right. Added new low level option for\n  controlling point size of group header.\n- [fontsetplot] Fixed syntax of assert statements. Produced error\n  messages on first use of the \\*plot commands.\n- [kernCheck] Fix so that it survives fonts with contextual kerning.\n  It does not, however, process the kern pairs in contextual kerning.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug in mark to ligature. You can now use an\n  `<anchor NULL>` element without having to follow it by a dummy mark\n  class reference.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug which limited source CID fonts to a maximum of\n  254 FDArray elements, rather than the limit of 255 FDArray elements\n  that is imposed by the CFF spec.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bugs in automatic GDEF generation. When now GDEF\n  is defined, all conflicting class assignments in the GlyphClass are\n  filtered out. If a glyph is assigned to a make class, that\n  assignment overrides any other class assignment. Otherwise, the\n  first assignment encountered will override a later assignment. For\n  example, since the BASE class is assigned first, assignment to the\n  BASE class will override later assignments to LIGATURE or COMPONENT\n  classes.\n- [makeotf] Fix bug in validating GDEF mark attachment rules. This\n  now validates the rules, rather than random memory. Had now effect\n  on the output font, but did sometimes produce spurious error\n  messages.\n- [makeotf] Fix crashing bug when trying to report that a glyph\n  being added to a mark class is already in the mark class.\n- [makeotf] If the OS/2 code page bit 29 (Macintosh encoding) is\n  set, then also set bit 0 (Latin (1252). Under Windows XP and Windows\n  7, if only the Mac bit is set, then the font is treated as having no\n  encoding, and you cannot apply the font to even basic Latin text.\n- [makeotf] By default, set Windows name ID 4 (Full Name) same as\n  Mac nameID 4, instead of setting it to the PostScript name. This is\n  in order to match the current definition of the name ID 4 in the\n  latest OpenType spec. A new option to makeotf ('-useOldNameID4'),\n  and a new key in the fontinfo file (\"UseOldNameID4\"), will cause\n  makeotf to still write the PS name to Windows name ID 4.\n- [makeotf] Add support for WPF names, name ID 21 and 22.\n- [makeotf] Fixed attachment order of marks to bug in generating\n  Mark to Ligature (GPOS lookup type 4). The component glyphs could be\n  reversed.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug in auto-generating GDEF table when Mark to\n  Mark (GPOS lookup Type 4) feature statements are used. The target\n  mark glyphs were registered as both GDEF GlyphClass Base and Mark\n  glyphs, and the former took precedence. makeotfexe now emits a\n  warning when a glyph gets assigned to more than one class when\n  auto-generating a GDEF table GlyphClass, and glyphs named in mark to\n  mark lookups are assigned only to the Mark GDEF glyph class.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bugs in generating TTF fonts from TTF input. It\n  now merges data from the head and hhea tables, and does a better job\n  of dealing with the 'post' table. The previous logic made\n  incorrect glyph names when the glyphs with names from the Mac Std\n  Encoding were not all contiguous and at the start of the font.\n- [makeotf] Added new option '-cn' for non-CID source fonts, to\n  allow reading multiple global font alignment zones and stem widths\n  from the fontinfo file, and using this to build a CID-keyed CFF\n  table with an identity CMAP. This is experimental only; such fonts\n  may not work in many apps.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug where the coverage table for an element in the\n  match string for a chaining contextual statement could have\n  duplicate glyphs. This happens when a glyph is specified more than\n  once in the class definition for the element. The result is that the\n  format 2 coverage table has successive ranges that overlap: the end\n  of one range is the same glyph ID as the start of the next range;\n  harmless, but triggers complaints in font validators.\n- [makeotf] Updated to latest Adobe CMAP files for ideographic\n  fonts. Changed name of CMAP directories in the AFDKO, and logic for\n  finding the files.\n- [makeotf] When providing a GDEF feature file definition, class\n  assignments now may be empty:\n\n        table GDEF {\n            GlyphClassDef ,,,;\n        } GDEF;\n\n  is a valid statement. You just need to provide all three commas and\n  the final colon to define the four classes. The following statement\n  builds a GDEF GlyphClass with an empty Components class.\n\n        table GDEF {\n            GlyphClassDef [B], [L], [M], ;\n        } GDEF;\n\n- [makeotf] The glyph alias file now defines order in which glyphs\n  are added to the end of the target font, as well as defining the\n  subset and renaming.\n- [makeotf] The `-cid <cidfontinfo>` option for converting a\n  font to CID can now be used without a glyph alias file, if the\n  source font glyphs have names in the form \"cidXXXX\", as is output\n  when mergeFonts is used to convert from CID to name-keyed. If the\n  `-cid <cidfontinfo>` option is used, and there is no glyph alias\n  file, then any glyphs in the font without a name in the form\n  \"cidXXXX\" will be ignored.\n- [spot] Added error message for duplicate glyph IDs in coverage\n  tables with format 2, a problem caused by a bug in makeotf with some\n  Adobe fonts that use chaining contextual substitution. Note: error\n  message is written only if level 7 GSUB/GPOS dump is requested.\n- [spot] Minor formatting changes to the GSUB/GPOS level 7 dump, to\n  make it easier to edit this into a real feature file.\n- [spot] When writing out feature file syntax for GPOS 'ignore\n  pos' rules, the rule name is now written as 'ignore pos', not\n  just 'ignore'.\n- [spot] Can now output glyph names up to 128 chars (Note: these are\n  not legal PostScript glyph names, and should be encountered only in\n  development fonts.)\n- [spot] Has new option '-ngid' which suppresses output of the\n  trailing glyph ID `@<gid>` for TTF fonts.\n- [spot] No longer dumps the DefaultLangSys entry when there is\n  none.\n- [spot] Changed dump logic for contextual and chain contextual\n  lookups so that spot will not dump the lookups referenced by the\n  substitution or position rules in the contextual lookups. The\n  previous logic led to some lookups getting dumped many times, and\n  also to infinite loops in cases where a contextual lookup referenced\n  other contextual lookups.\n- [spot] Added support for Apple kern subtable format 3. Fixed old\n  bug causing crash when dumping font with Apple kern table from\n  Windows OS.\n- [spot] Fixed error when dumping Apple kern table subtable format\n  0, when kern table is at end of font file.\n- [spot] Fixed crashing bug seen in DejaVuSansMono.TTF: spot did not\n  expect an anchor offset to be zero in a Base Array base Record.\n- [spot] Removed comma from lookupflag dump, to match feature file\n  spec.\n- [spot] Added logic to support name table format 1, but it probably\n  does not work, since I have been unable to find a font to test with\n  this format.\n- [spot] Fixed spelling error for \"Canadian\" in OS/2 code page\n  fields.\n- [spot] Changed dump of cmap subtable 14: hex values are\n  uppercased, and base+UVS values are written in the order [base,\n  uvs].\n- [stemHist] Always set the alignment zones outside the font BBox,\n  so as to avoid having the source font alignment zones affect\n  collection of stem widths.\n- [stemHist] Fix bug where the glyph names reported in the stem and\n  alignment reports were off by 1 GID if the list of glyphs included\n  the '.notdef' glyph.\n- [tx] Added support for option '-n' to remove hints for writing\n  Type 1 and CFF output fonts.\n- [tx] Added new option \"+b\" to the cff output mode, to force\n  glyph order in the output font to be the same as in the input font.\n- [tx] Fixed bug in flattening 'seac' operator. If the glyph\n  components were not in the first 256 glyphs, then the wrong glyph\n  would be selected.\n- [tx] Added new library to read in svg fonts as a source. tx can\n  now read all the SVG formats that it can write. Handles only the\n  path operators: M, m, L, L, C, c, Z, z, and the font and glyph\n  attributes: 'font-family', 'unicode', 'horiz-adv-x',\n  'glyph-name', 'missing-glyph'.\n- [tx] Fixed bug in converting TTF to OpenType/CFF. It flipped the\n  sign of the ItalicAngle in the 'post' table, which in turn flipped\n  the sign of the OS/2 table fields ySubscriptXOffset and\n  ySuperscriptXOffset. This bug showed up in TTF fonts built by\n  makeotf, as makeotf uses 'tx' to build a temporary Type 1 font\n  from the source TTF.\n- [tx] Fixed bug where '-usefd' option was not respected, when\n  converting from CID to name-keyed fonts.\n- Updated the internal Python interpreter to version 2.7.\n- Updated Adobe Cmaps/Adobe-Japan1 files:\n\n  - Adobe-Japan1\\_sequences.txt\n  - UniJIS-UTF32-H\n  - UniJIS2004-UTF32-H\n  - UniJISX0213-UTF32-H\n  - UniJISX02132004-UTF32-H\n\n- Added several scripts related to CID font production:\n\n  - cmap-tool.pl\n  - extract-cids.pl\n  - extract-gids.pl\n  - extract-names.pl\n  - fdarray-check.pl\n  - fix-fontbbox.pl\n  - hintcidfont.pl\n  - subr-check.pl\n\n2.5.25466 (released 2012-03-04)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [charplot] This was non-functional since build 21898. Now fixed.\n- [checkOutlines] Changed so that the test for nearly vertical or\n  horizontal lines is invoked only if the user specifies the options\n  '-i' or '-4', instead of always. It turns out that this test,\n  when fixed automatically, causes more problems than it cures in CJK\n  fonts.\n- [compareFamily] Changed so that the default is to check stem\n  widths and positions for bogus hints. Used 'tx' rather than Python\n  code for parsing charstring in order to speed up hint check.\n- [compareFamily] Updated script tags and language tags according to\n  OpenType specification version 1.6.\n- [documentation] In feature file syntax reference, fixed some\n  errors and bumped the document version to 1.10.\n- [documentation] Fixed typo in example in section 4.d: lookFlag\n  values are separated by spaces, not commas.\n- [documentation] Fixed typo in example in section 8.c on stylistic\n  names: quotes around name string need to be matching double quotes.\n  Reported by Karsten Luecke.\n- [documentation] Changed agfln.txt copyright notice to BSD license.\n- [makeInstances] Fixed bug where a space character in any of the\n  path arguments caused it to fail.\n- [makeInstances] Fixed bug that can make the FontBBox come out\n  wrong when using ExtraGlyphs.\n- [makeInstances] Fixed rounding bug that could (rarely) cause\n  makeInstances to think that a composite glyph is being scaled (which\n  is not supported by this script) when it is not.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug in generating TTF fonts from TTF input.\n  Previous version simply did not work.\n- [spot] Added support for \"Small\" fonts, an Adobe internal\n  Postscript variant used for CJK fonts.\n- [spot] Added support for large kern tables, such as in the Vista\n  font Cambria, where the size of the kern subtable exceeds the value\n  that can be held in the subtable \"length\" field. In this case, the\n  \"length\" filed must be ignored.\n- [spot] Fixed proof option to show GPOS records in GID order by\n  default, and in lookup order only with the '-f' option. It had\n  always been proofing the GPOS rules in lookup order since 2003.\n- [spot] Fixed double memory deallocation when dumping TTC files;\n  this could cause a crash.\n- [spot] When decompiling GSUB table to feature file format (-t\n  GSUB=7) and reporting skipped lookups identify lookups which are\n  referenced by a chaining contextual rule.\n- [sfntedit] Changed final \"done\" message to be sent to stdout\n  instead of stderr. Reported by Adam Twardoch.\n- [stemHist] Fixed typo in help text, reported by Lee Digidea:\n  '-all' option was not working.\n- [tx] Added new option '-std' to force StdEncoding in output CFF\n  fonts.\n\n2.5.21898 (released 2009-05-01)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [autohint/checkOutlines] Fixed rare case when an _rrcurveto_ is\n  preceded by such a long list of _rlineto_ that the stack limit is\n  passed.\n- [autohint/checkOutlines] Fixed to restore font.pfa output file to\n  StandardEncoding Encoding vector. Since requirements of CFF\n  StandardEncoding differs from Type 1 StandardEncoding, a\n  StandardEncodingEncoding vector in a Type 1 font was sometimes\n  getting converted to a custom Encoding vector when being\n  round-tripped through the CFF format which autohint does internally.\n- [checkOutlines] Fixed random crash on Windows due to buffer\n  overrun.\n- [checkOutlines] Changed default logging mode to not report glyph\n  names when there is no error report for the glyph.\n- [CompareFamily] Added \"ring\" to the list of accent names used to\n  find (accented glyph, base glyph) pairs for Single Face Test 23.\n  Reported by David Agg.\n- Renamed showfont to fontplot2 to avoid conflict with the Mac OSX\n  showfont tool.\n- Fixed problem with showing vertical origin and advance: was not\n  using VORG and vmtx table correctly.\n- [FontLab scripts] Added logic to Instance Generator to support\n  eliminating \"working\" glyphs from instances, to substitute\n  alternate glyph designs for specific instances, and to update more\n  Font Dict fields in the instance fonts. Added help.\n- Added command line equivalent, \"makeInstances' which does the same\n  thing, but which uses the IS tool for making the snapshot. See the\n  'IS' entry.\n- [IS] Added new tool for \"intelligent scaling\". This uses the\n  hinting in an MM font to keep glyph paths aligned when snapshotting\n  from MM fonts. The improvement is most visible in glyphs with\n  several elements that need to maintain alignment, such as percent\n  and perthousand. It is also useful for the same reason when scaling\n  fonts from a large em-square size to a smaller size. To be\n  effective, the source MM font must be hinted and must have global\n  alignment zones defined. The new font must be re-hinted. For\n  instances from MM fonts especially, it is a good idea to redo the\n  alignment zones, as the blending of the MM base designs usually does\n  not produce the best alignment zones or stem widths for the instance\n  fonts. makeInstances and \"Instance Generator\" scripts allow you to\n  preserve these modifications when redoing the MM instance snapshot.\n- [makeotf] Fixed generation of version 1.2 GDEF table to match the\n  final OpenType spec version 1.6. This version is generated only when\n  the new lookup flag 'UseMarkFilteringSet\" is used.\n- [makeotf] Fixed generation of names for stylistic alternates\n  features. There was a bug such that in some circumstances, the\n  feature table entry for the stylistic alternate feature would point\n  to the wrong lookup table.\n- [makeotf] Fixed generation of the reverse substitution lookup\n  type. This was unintentionally disabled just before the previous\n  release.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bugs in memory management of glyph objects. If the\n  font built, it was correct, but this bug could cause the font to\n  fail to build.\n- [spot] Fixed to dump GDEF table version 1.2 according to the final\n  OpenType spec version 1.6.\n- [spot] Fixed feature-format dump of the lookupflags\n  MarkAttachmentType and UseMarkFilteringSet to give a class name as\n  an argument, rather than a class index.\n- [spot] Extended the GDEF table dump to provide a more readable\n  form.\n- [spot] Added dump formats for htmx and vtmx to show the advance\n  and side bearing metrics for all glyphs.\n\n2.5.21340 (released 2009-01-22)\n-------------------------------\n\n- [AGLFN] (Adobe Glyph List for New Fonts) Created new version 1.7.\n- [AGLFN] Reverted to the AGLFN v1.4 name and Unicode assignments\n  for Delta, Omega, and mu. The v1.6 versions were better from a\n  designer's point of view, but we cannot use name-to-Unicode value\n  mappings that conflict with the historic usage in the Adobe Glyph\n  List 2.0. See\n  <http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html>.\n- [AGLFN] Dropped all the 'afii' names from the list: 'uni'\n  names are actually more descriptive, and map to the right Unicode\n  values under Mac OSX.\n- [AGLFN] Dropped all the 'commaccent' names from the list:\n  'uni' names map to the right Unicode values under Mac OSX before\n  10.4.x.\n- [autohint] Converted AC.py script to call a command-line program\n  rather than a Python extension module, same way makeotf works, to\n  avoid continuing Python version problems.\n- [autohint] Fixed to actually emit vstem3 and hstem3 hint operators\n  (counter control hints, which work to keep the space between three\n  stems open and equal, as in an 'm') - this has been broken since\n  the first AFDKO. It will now also look in the same directory as the\n  source font for a file named \"fontinfo\", and will attempt to add\n  stem3 hints to the glyph which are listed by name in the name list\n  for the keys \"HCounterChars\" or \"VCounterChars\".\n- [autohint] Fixed old bug where it would only pay attention to the\n  bottom four of the top zone specified in the FontDict BlueValues\n  list. This results in more edge hints in tall glyphs.\n- [autohint] Fixed special case when adding flex operator which\n  could result in an endless loop\n- [autohint] Added 'logOnly' option, to allow collecting report\n  without changing the font.\n- [autohint] Added option to specify which glyphs to exclude from\n  autohinting.\n- [autohint] Suppressed generation and use of `<font-name>.plist`\n  file, unless it is specifically requested.\n- [autohint] Fixed bug where an extremely complex glyph would\n  overflow a buffer of the list of hints.\n- [checkOutlines] Improved overlap detection and path orientation:\n  it will now work with outlines formed by overlapping many stroke\n  elements, as is sometimes done in developing CJK fonts.\n- [checkOutlines] added new test for nearly vertical or horizontal\n  lines. Fixed bug in this new code, reported by Erik van Blokland.\n- [CompareFamily] For the warning that the Full Family name in the\n  CFF table differs from that in the name table, changed it to a\n  \"Warning\" rather than \"Error\", and explained that there is no\n  functional consequence.\n- [CompareFamily] Removed check that Mac names ID 16 and 17 do not\n  exist, as makeotf now does make them. See notes in MakeOTF User\n  Guide about this.\n- [CompareFamily] Fixed so it works with TTF fonts again.\n- [makeotf] Removed code that added a default Adobe copyright to the\n  name table if no copyright is specified, and removed code to add a\n  default trademark.\n- [makeotf] Added support for the lookupflag UseMarkFilteringSet.\n  This is defined in the proposed changes for OpenType spec 1.6, and\n  is subject to change in definition.\n- [makeotf] Dropped restriction that vmtx/VORG/vhea tables will only\n  be written for CID-keyed fonts. The presence in the feature file of\n  either a 'vrt2' feature of vmtx table overrides will now cause\n  these tables to be written for both CID-keyed and name-keyed fonts.\n- [makeotf] Added warning when a feature is referenced in the aalt\n  feature definition, but either does not exist or does not contribute\n  any rules to the aalt feature. The aalt feature can take only single\n  and alternate substitution rules.\n- [makeotf] Added support for the following lookup types:\n\n  - GSUB type 2 Multiple Substitution\n  - GSUB type 8 Reverse Chaining Single Substitution\n  - GPOS type 3 Cursive Adjustment\n  - GPOS type 4 Mark-to-Base Attachment\n  - GPOS type 5 Mark-to-Ligature Attachment\n  - GPOS type 6 Mark-to-Mark Attachment\n\n- [makeotf] Added support for explicit definition of the GDEF table,\n  and automatic creation of the GDEF when any of the lookup flag\n  settings for ignoring a glyph class is used, or any mark classes are\n  defined.\n- [makeotf] Support using TTF fonts as input, to build an\n  OpenType/TTF font, with the limitation that glyph order and glyph\n  names cannot be changed. This is rather ugly under the hood, but it\n  works. The MakeOTF.py Python script uses the tx tool to convert the\n  TTF font to CFF data without changing glyph order or names. It then\n  builds an OpenType/CFF font. It then uses the sfntedit tool to copy\n  the TTF glyph data to the OpenType font, and to delete the CFF\n  table.\n- [makeotf] Added support for building Unicode Variation Selectors\n  for CID-keyed fonts, using the new cmap subtable type 14.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug with inheritance of default rules by scripts\n  and languages in feature file feature definitions. Explicitly\n  defined languages were only getting default rules defined after the\n  last script statement, and when a script is named, languages of the\n  script which are not named got no rules at all.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug where you could not run makeotf when the\n  current directory is not the same is the source font's home\n  directory.\n- [makeotf] Set OS/2.lastChar field to U+FFFF when using mappings\n  beyond the BMP.\n- [makeotf] Create the Mac platform name table font menu names by\n  the same rules as used for the Windows menu names. Add new keywords\n  to the FontMenuNameDB file syntax. If you use the old keywords, you\n  get the old format; if you use the new syntax, you get nameIDs 1, 2\n  and 16 and 17 just like for the Windows platform.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug in name table font menu names: if you entered\n  a non-English Preferred name (\"f=\") and not a compatible family\n  name (\"c=\"), you would end up with a nameID 16 but no nameID 17.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bogus 'deprecated \"except\" syntax' message\n  under Windows.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug where contextual pos statements without\n  backtrack or lookahead context were writing as a non-contextual\n  rule. Reported by Karsten Luecke.\n- [makeotf] Added new option to make stub GSUB table when no GSUB\n  rules are present.\n- [makeotf] Added warning if the aalt feature definition references\n  any feature tags that either do not exist in the font, or do not\n  contribute any rules that the aalt feature can use.\n- [sfntdiff] Fixed so that only error messages are written to\n  stderr; all others now written to stdout.\n- [sfntdiff] Fixed bug in dump of 'name' table: when processing\n  directories rather than individual files, the name table text was\n  never updated after the first file for the second directory.\n- [spot] Fixed option '-F' to show the contextual rule sub-lookup\n  indices, and to flag those which have already been used by another\n  lookup.\n- [spot] If a left side class 0 is empty, do not report it.\n- [spot] For GSUB/GPOS=7 FEA dump, give each class a unique name in\n  the entire font by appending the lookup ID to the class names. It\n  was just `[LEFTCLASS]()<class index>_<subtable index>`, but\n  these names are repeated in every lookup. It is now\n  `LEFTCLASS_c<class index>_s<subtable index>_l<lookup\n  index>`.\n- [spot] When a positioning value record has more than one value,\n  print the full 4 item value record. Previously, it would just print\n  non-zero values. This was confusing when dumping Adobe Arabic, as\n  you would see two identical values at the end of some pos rules. In\n  fact, each of these pos rule does have two adjustment values, one\n  for x and one for y advance adjustment, that happen to be the same\n  numeric value.\n- [spot] Fixed to write backtrack context glyphs in the right order.\n- [tx] Added option to NOT clamp design coordinates to within the\n  design space when snapshotting MM fonts.\n- [tx] Added option to subroutinize the font when writing to CFF.\n  This option is derived from the same code used by makeotfexe, but\n  takes only about 10% the memory and runs much faster. This should\n  allow subroutinizing large CJK fonts that makeotfexe could not\n  handle. This is new code, so please test results carefully, i.e. if\n  you use it, always check that the flattened glyphs outlines from the\n  output font are identical to the flattened glyph outlines from the\n  input font.\n- [ttxn] Added options to suppress hinting in the font program, and\n  version and build numbers.\n\n2.0.27 (released 2007-11-10)\n----------------------------\n\n- [compareFamily] Fixed Single Test 3 (reported by Mark Simonson and\n  others); the test should compare the Mac platform name ID 4 (name ID\n  1 + space + name ID 2) with the target value, but was instead using\n  the value of the name ID 18 (Compatible Full Name).\n- [compareFamily] Fixed Family Test 2 to print a report that helps\n  determine which {platform, script, language, name ID} is present in\n  some fonts but not others.\n- [IS] Fixed a bug where applying hint-based scaling can cause an\n  off-by-1 error when the the _closepath_ position is supposed to\n  coincide with the original _moveto_, leading to an effective final\n  1-unit _lineto_, that may overlap the initial path. In the old MM\n  design world, we worked around this issue by designing the MMs so\n  that there was always a one unit difference between a final _curveto_\n  point and the original _moveto_. FontLab doesn't support doing that\n  automatically, so when making an instance, **IS** will instead simply\n  look for cases where the _moveto_ and _closepath_ positions differ by\n  one unit, and move the _moveto_ position to coincide with the\n  _closepath_ position.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug where specifying thousands of singleton kern\n  pairs could silently overflow offsets, and makeotf would build a bad\n  font without any warning. (reported by Adam Twardoch)\n- [makeotf] Relative file paths can now be used even if the current\n  directory is not the source font directory. Project files can now be\n  saved to directories other than the source font directory. Note that\n  paths stored in project file are relative to the project file's\n  directory. (reported by Andreas Seidel)\n- [makeotf/spot] Added support for Unicode Variation Sequences (UVSes).\n  See MakeOTF User's Guide and\n  [Unicode Technical Standard #37](http://unicode.org/reports/tr37/)\n- [spot] Fixed bug where contents of 'size' GPOS feature would be\n  printed for all dump levels.\n- [spot] Fixed failure to process 'post' table format 4.0. which\n  occurs in some Apple TT fonts, such as Osaka.dfont\n- Updated Adobe-Japan-1 CMAP files for building CID fonts.\n\n2.0.26 (released 2007-05-05)\n----------------------------\n\n- Added `featurefile.plist` for BBedit. Install this in the location\n  shown at the top of the file; it enables code coloring for FEA syntax.\n  The file is in FDK/Tools/SharedData\n- Added `MSFontValidatorIssues.html` to FDK/Technical Documentation. It\n  lists the error messages from the MS FontValidator tool that can be\n  ignored for OpenType/CFF fonts.\n- [FontLab macros] Added InstanceGenerator. Another script for making\n  instances from an MM VFB font. It's simpler than MakeInstances macro.\n- [FontLab macros] Removed debug statement in Set Start Points which\n  blocked processing more than 50 glyphs. (reported by George Ryan)\n- [FontLab macros] Added explanation of CheckOutlines errors to help\n  dialog.\n- [checkOutlines] Added option '-he' to print explanation of error\n  messages.\n- [compareFamily] Added error if the font's CFF table contains a\n  Type 2 `seac` operator. The CFF spec does not support this operator.\n  Some very old tools allow this to happen.\n- [makeotf] Fixed a bug in decomposing glyphs that are defined as\n  composite glyphs in a Type 1 source font. This bug caused the base\n  component to be shifted when then left side bearing of the composite\n  glyph differs from that of the base glyph. This could be consequential,\n  as FontLab has an option to not decompose composite glyphs when\n  generating a Type 1 font.\n- [makeotf] Fixed a bug in recognizing the \"Korea1\" order when trying\n  to pick a default Mac cmap script ID from a CID-keyed font's ROS\n  (Registry-Order-Supplement) field.\n- [tx] Fixed a bug in decomposing pretty much all composite glyphs\n  from Type 1 and CFF source fonts. It happened only when a Type 1 or\n  CFF font was being subset, i.e. converted into a font with fewer\n  glyphs. tx now has the option '+Z' to force this to occur.\n\n2.0.25 (released 2007-03-30)\n----------------------------\n\n- [autohint] Added a new option to allow extending the list of glyph\n  names for which autohint will try to make counter hints.\n- [autohint] Fixed bug where Type 2 operator stack limit could be\n  exceeded when optimizing Type 2 charstrings during conversion from\n  bez format.\n- [autohint] Fixed bug in setting OtherBlues alignment zone values.\n- [FontLab macros] The Autohint macro behaves quite differently when\n  adding 'flex' hints is turned off; it makes more hint substitutions,\n  since these are not allowed within the segment of the outline that\n  contributes the 'flex' stem. Turned it on, so that hint results will\n  be the same as the command-line tool. This does not affect the outline\n  data.\n- [checkOutlines] Fixed bug that prevented the reporting of two\n  successive points with the same coordinates. The code to convert from\n  the source outline data to bez format was suppressing zero-length line\n  segments, so the checkOutlines module never experienced the problem.\n- [compareFamily] Added new options '-st n1,n2..' and '-ft n1,n2..' to\n  allow executing only specific tests.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed test \"Warn if a style-linked family group does\n  not have FamilyBlues\". When reporting the error that FamilyBlues differ\n  in a style-linked family group (where at least one font does have real\n  FamilyBlues), use BlueValues as implied FamilyBlues when the latter\n  attribute is missing from a font. Same for FamilyOtherBlues.\n- [compareFamily] Warn about zones outside of font's BBox only if the\n  entire zone is outside of the BBox, not just one edge, and warn only\n  for BlueValue zones, not FamilyBlueValue zones.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed fsType check. Complain if fsType is not 8 only\n  for Adobe fonts, determined by checking if the name table trademark\n  string is empty or contains \"Adobe\".\n- [compareFamily] Fixed Single Face Test 3 to compare the CFF Full Name\n  with the name table Preferred Full Name (ID 18) rather than the Full\n  Name (ID 4).\n- [compareFamily] Fixed bug where it failed with CID fonts, because it\n  referenced the \"Private\" dict attribute of the font's topDict, which\n  does not exist in CID fonts.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed 'size' test to support the format that indicates\n  only intended design size, where no range is supplied.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed ligature width check to also check that left\n  and right side bearings match those of the left and right components,\n  and to use the 'liga' feature to identify ligatures and their components,\n  instead of heuristics based on glyph names.\n- [makeotf] Disallowed negative values in the feature file for the OS/2\n  table winAscent and winDescent fields.\n- [makeotf] Fixed a bug where a lookup excluded with the `exclude_dflt`\n  keyword was nevertheless included if the script/language was specified\n  with a languagesystem statement.\n- [makeotf] Fixed issue on Windows where a user would see a debug\n  assert dialog when the OS/2 vendorID was not specified in the feature\n  file, and the Copyright string contained an 8-bit ASCII character, like\n  the 'copyright' character.\n- [makeotf] Fixed issue on Windows where name ID 17 would be garbage if\n  no FontMenuNameDB was supplied, and the PostScript name did not contain\n  a hyphen.\n- [makeotf] Added warning for Mac OSX pre 10.5 compatibility: total size\n  of glyphs names plus 2 bytes padding per glyph must be less than 32K, or\n  OSX will crash.\n- [makeotf] Fixed crash that occurred if the feature file did not have\n  a languagesystem statement.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug in subroutinizer which allowed a subroutine stack\n  depth of up to 10, but the Type 1 and Type 2 specs allow only 9. This\n  caused most rasterizers to declare the font invalid.\n- [makeotf] Removed '-cv' option; CJK vertical CMaps have not been\n  supported since FDK 1.6.\n- [spot] Added support for low-level and feature file style\n  text dumps of GPOS Attachment formats 3, 4, 5 and 6.\n- [spot] Added dump of lookup flag value to the feature-file style\n  report.\n- [spot] Added MarkAndAttachmentClassDef record to GDEF table report.\n- [spot] Added support for GSUB lookup type 2 (Multiple) when within\n  contextual substitutions.\n- [spot] Fixed bug in GSUB lookup 5, causing crash in dumping trado.ttf.\n- [spot] Fixed bug in level 7 (feature-file syntax) dump of GPOS table;\n  was omitting the value record for extension lookup types.\n- [spot] Fixed crash on Windows when proofing contextual substitution\n  statements.\n- [spot] Made Windows version behave like Mac when proofing: PostScript\n  file data is always sent to standard output, and must be re-directed to\n  a file.\n- [spot] Improved documentation of proofing output and '-P' option.\n- [spot] Fixed DSIG table reporting of TTC fonts with the version 2 TTC\n  header, even if the header reports it is version 1, like meiryo.ttc.\n- [spot] Enabled proofing TTC fonts that don't have glyph names in the\n  post table.\n- [spot] Fixed origin offset of bounding box for TTF fonts.\n- [spot] Fixed crash in proofing TTF fonts when the last glyph is\n  non-marking, like trado.ttf in LongHorn.\n\n2.0.24 (released 2006-11-06) \u2014 Public release of FDK 2.0\n----------------------------\n\n- [autohint/checkOutlines/ProofPDF] Fixed glyph name handling to avoid\n  stack dump when glyph is not in font. Added support for CID values that\n  are not zero-padded to 5 hex digits.\n- [autohint] Fixed bug where edge hints would be generated rather than\n  regular hints across the baseline, when there were fewer than 8 pairs of\n  BlueValues.\n- [checkOutlines] Fixed bug where it would not report an overlap if\n  there were an even number of overlapping contours.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed Italic angle Single Test 12 to look at the middle\n  third of the test glyph stems, rather than the top and bottom of the\n  glyph bounding box, when guessing the font's italic angle.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed Single Test 15 to allow a difference of 1 unit in\n  the font BBox, to allow for rounding differences.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed Single Test 26 to identify uXXXX names as valid\n  Unicode names; had bug in the regular expression that required 5 digits.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed Single Test 22 to treat glyphs in the combining\n  mark Unicode range u3000-u036F range as accent glyphs; require that they\n  have the same width as the base glyph.\n- [compareFamily] Changed report from Error to Warning for check that\n  only the first four Panose values are non-zero.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed bug that caused a stack dump in Single Test 16\n  and 22.\n- [compareFamily] Added tests for Mac OSX pre 10.4 compatibility: no\n  charstring is < 32K, total size of glyphs names plus padding is less\n  than 32K.\n- [compareFamily] Added test that known shipping font does not have OS/2\n  table version 4, and that new fonts do.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed Single Test 11: allow BASE offset to differ from\n  calculated offset by up to 10 design units before it complains.\n- [compareFamily/makeotf] Fixed failure when tools path contains a space.\n- [kernCheck] New tool; looks for kern GPOS rules that conflict, and also\n  looks for glyph pairs that overlap.\n- [kernCheck] Added option to allow running only the check of GPOS\n  subtables for kerning rules that mask each other.\n- [makeotf] Fixed '-adds' option.\n- [makeotf] Added new option '-fi' to specify path to fontinfo file.\n- [makeotf] Added new option '-rev' to increment the fontRevision field.\n- [makeotf] If the (cid)fontinfo file contains the keyword/value for\n  FSType, will check that the value is the same as the OS/2 fsType field\n  in the final OTF font. This has to do with historic Adobe CJK font\n  development practices.\n- [makeotf] Added support for setting some of the Plane 1+ bits in the\n  OS/2 ulUnicodeRange fields.\n- [mergeFonts] Will now apply to the output font the values for the\n  fields Weight and XUID, from the cidfontinfo file.\n- [spot] Added support for showing some of the Plane 1+ bits in the OS/2\n  ulUnicodeRange fields.\n- [stemHist] When requiring that reports not already exist, don't delete\n  older stem reports when asking for new alignment zone reports, and\n  vice-versa.\n- [setsnap.pl] New tool to pick standard stem hint values. This Perl\n  script takes in the report from stemHist, and recommends a set of values\n  to use for the Type 1 font standard stem arrays. This is not as good as\n  choosing the most relevant values yourself, but better than not providing\n  any values.\n- In _Overview.html_, added warning about 'languagesystem Dflt dflt' and FDK\n  1.6 feature files.\n- In _MakeOTFUserGuide.pdf_, expanded discussion of fontinfo file, updated\n  documentation of OS/2 v4 table bits with Adobe's practices for the next\n  library release.\n- In _OT Feature File Syntax.html_, fixed incorrect sign for winAscent\n  keyword, extended discussion of DFLT script tag and useExtension keyword,\n  and fixed minor typos.\n- Added two new tech notes on using rotateFont and mergeFonts.\n\n2.0.22 (released 2006-09-12)\n----------------------------\n\n- [compareFamily] Single Test 3 now also checks that Mac name ID 4 starts\n  with Preferred Family name, and is the same as the CFF table Full Name.\n- [compareFamily] Added test for existence and validation of BASE table\n  in Single Test 11.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed bug where failed when reporting font BBox error.\n- [compareFamily] Added test that some specific glyph names were not\n  changed from previous version of font, in Single Test 26.\n- [compareFamily] Added \"Single Face Test 27: Check\n  strikeout/subscript/superscript positions\". Checks values against default\n  calculations based on the em-box size.\n- [compareFamily] Added \"Single Face Test 28: Check font OS/2 codepages\n  for a common set of code page bits\". Checks OS/2 ulCodePageRange and\n  ulUnicodeRange blocks against the default makeotf heuristics.\n- [compareFamily] Added in Single Test 12 a rough calculation of the\n  italic angle. Warns if this is more than 3 degrees different than the\n  post table Italic angle value.\n- [compareFamily] Added in Family Test 15 a check that all fonts in a\n  preferred family have the same hhea table underline size and position\n  values.\n- [compareFamily] Added \"Family Test 16: Check that for all faces in a\n  preferred family group, the width of any glyph is not more than 3 times\n  the width of the same glyph in any other face\".\n- [compareFamily] Fixed Family Test 3 to be more efficient.\n- [makeotf/makeotfexe] Added a new option '-maxs `<integer>`' to limit\n  the number of subroutines generated by subroutinization. Used only when\n  building test fonts to explore possible errors in processing the\n  subroutines.\n- [makeotf/makeotfexe] Allow working names to be longer than 31\n  characters; warn but don't quit, if final names are longer than 31\n  characters.\n\n2.0.21 (released 2006-08-31)\n----------------------------\n\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug where 'size' feature was built incorrectly when it\n  was the only GPOS feature in the font.\n- [spot] Improved error messages for 'size' feature problems.\n- [compareFamily] Added dependency on environment variables:\n  **CF_DEFAULT_URL** should be set to the foundry's URL; it's compared\n  with name ID 11.\n  **CF_DEFAULT_FOUNDRY_CODE** should be set to the foundry's 4-letter\n  vendor code; it's compared with OS/2 table achVendID field.\n- [compareFamily] Check that CFF PostScript name is the same as Mac and\n  Windows name table name ID 6.\n- [compareFamily] Check that named IDs 9 and 11 (designer name and\n  foundry URL) exist.\n- [compareFamily] Extended Single Test 4 to verify that version string\n  is in correct format '(Version|OTF) n.nnn'.\n- [compareFamily] Improved Panose test to check that values are not all\n  0, and that the CFF font dict 'isFixedPitch' field matches the Panose\n  monospace value.\n- [compareFamily] Added check to confirm the presence of Unicode cmap\n  sub table.\n- [compareFamily] Added check to confirm that latn/dflt and DFLT/dflt\n  script/languages are present, if there are any GPOS or GSUB rules. Also\n  checks that script and language tags are in registered lists, and that\n  all faces have the same set of language and script tags, and feature\n  list under each language and script pair.\n- [compareFamily] Added check to confirm that all faces in the family\n  have the same OS/2 table fsType embedding permission values.\n- [compareFamily] Added check to confirm that if font has Bold style\n  bit, the CFF forceBold flag is on. Also vice-versa, if the font weight\n  is less than 700.\n- [compareFamily] Added check to confirm that the font does not have a\n  UniqueID or XUID, if it's not CID-keyed.\n- [compareFamily] Added glyph name checks: OS/2 default char is .notdef,\n  and that there are NULL and CR glyphs in TrueType fonts, and that names\n  conform to the current Adobe Glyph Dictionary. Note that latest practice\n  is to use 'uni' names for final names for all the 'afii' glyphs.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed family BlueValues tests to compare within\n  compatible family name groups.\n- [compareFamily] Changed Family Test 2 to check that all name IDs\n  except 16, 17, 18, are all present with the same language/script values\n  within all faces of a preferred family.\n- [compareFamily] Changed Single Test 3, which didn't do at all what it\n  described.\n- [FontLab macros] Fixed bug introduced when changing modules shared\n  with command-line scripts in build 19.\n\n2.0.20 (released 2006-08-14)\n----------------------------\n\n- [ProofPDF] Fixed bug in waterfallplot mode, where Acrobat would\n  report the output PDF file as being damaged.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug that prevented building CID fonts in release\n  mode, introduced in build 19.\n\n2.0.19 (released 2006-08-04)\n----------------------------\n\n- [compareFamily] Added Family Test 13 to report error if two fonts in\n  the same preferred family have the same OS/2 weight, width and Italic\n  settings, and the OS/2 version is greater than 3. Also reports an error\n  if the fsSelection field bit 8 \"WEIGHT_WIDTH_SLOPE_ONLY\" is set\n  differently across faces of the same preferred family name group.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed Family Test 12 to not fail when the font has a\n  script/language with no DefaultLangSys entry.\n- [makeotf] If a font file with the requested output file name already\n  exists, will delete it before running makeotfexe, so can tell if it\n  failed.\n- [makeotf] Will now set the new 'fsSlection' bits if the following\n  key/value pairs are in the 'fontinfo' file:\n\n        PreferOS/2TypoMetrics 1\n        IsOS/2WidthWeigthSlopeOnly 1\n        IsOS/2OBLIQUE 1\n\n- [digiplot] Added new option to specify the font baseline, so the\n  baseline can be set correctly when proofing a font file without a BASE\n  table.\n- [digiplot] Allowed using a CID layout file to supply meta info when\n  proofing name-keyed fonts.\n- [ProofPDF] Added two functions: **waterfallplot** and **fontsetplot**.\n  waterfallplot does not yet work with TrueType or CID-keyed fonts.\n\n2.0.17 (released 2006-05-15)\n----------------------------\n\n- Fixed multiple tools to allow installing the FDK on Windows on a path\n  containing spaces.\n- [autohint] Added option to suppress hint substitution.\n- [autohint] Fixed help and message to refer to 'autohint' tool name,\n  rather than to the AC script file name.\n- [autohint] Fixed bug in processing hint masks: bytes with no bits set\n  were being omitted.\n- [autohint] Added option to allow hinting fonts without StdHW or StdVW\n  entries in the font Private font-dictionary.\n- [checkOutlines] Fixed writing out the changes when fixing outlines.\n- [checkOutlines] Fixed bug that mangled outlines when three alternating\n  perpendicular lines or vh/hv/vv/hh curveto's followed each other.\n- [checkOutlines] Will now write report to a log file as well as to\n  screen. Added option to set log file path, and added numeric suffix to\n  name so as to avoid overwriting existing log files.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed issue that happened when looking through the\n  directory for font files, when encountering a file for which the user\n  did not have read permission.\n- [compareFamily] Added Single Test 24: check that 'size' feature\n  Design Size is within the design range specified for the font.\n- [ProofPDF] Added **showfont** command to show how to customize a\n  command file to produce a different page layout.\n- [ProofPDF] Fixed so fonts with em-square other then 1000 will work.\n- [fontplot/charplot/digiplot/hintplot/showfont] Added support for\n  Type 1 font files as well as OTF and TTF files.\n- [makeotf] Fixed MakeOTF to survive being given a font path with spaces.\n- [makeotf] Fixed '-S' and '-r' options.\n- [makeotf] Added new option '-osv `<number>`' to allow setting the OS/2\n  table version number.\n- [makeotf] Added new option '-osbOn `<number>`' to set arbitrary\n  bitfields in OS/2 table 'fsSelection' to on. May be repeated more than\n  once to set more than one bit.\n- [makeotf] Added new option '-osbOff `<number>`' to set arbitrary\n  bitfields in OS/2 table 'fsSelection' to off. May be repeated more than\n  once to unset more than one bit.\n- [makeotf] If neither '-b' nor '-i' options are used, check for a file\n  'fontinfo' in the same directory as the source font file, and set the\n  style bits if these key/values are found:\n\n        IsBoldStyle true\n        IsItalicStyle true\n\n- [FontLab macros] Built the autohint and checkOutline libraries (PyAC\n  and focusdll) linked with Python2.3 so they work with FontLab 5.\n- [mergeFonts] Added option to copy only font metrics from first source\n  font.\n- [mergeFonts] Allow empty lines and \"#\" comment lines in glyph alias\n  and in cidfontinfo files.\n- [rotateFont] Fixed bug where it did not allow negative numbers.\n- [rotateFont] Allow empty lines and \"#\" comment lines in rotation info\n  file\n- [sfntedit] Fixed so that it will not leave the temp file behind on a\n  fatal error, nor quit because one already exists.\n- [spot] Fixed order of backtrack glyphs in dump of chaining contextual\n  `sub` and `pos` statements. Now assumes that these are built in the\n  correct order.\n- Added two new tools, **type1** and **detype1**, that compile/decompile\n  a Type 1 font from/to a plain text representation.\n\n2.0.5 (released 2006-02-14)\n---------------------------\n\n- [compareFamily] Added warning if sum of OS/2 table sTypoLineGap,\n  sTypoAscender, and sTypoDescender is not equal to the sum of usWinAscent\n  and usWinDescent.\n- [compareFamily] Updated test for allowable weights in style-linked\n  faces to reflect the current behavior of Windows XP.\n- [compareFamily] Added check for OpenType/CFF: Windows name table ID 4\n  (Full Name) is the same as the PostScript name.\n- [compareFamily] Added report on sets of features in different\n  languagesystems, and an error message if they are not the same in all\n  faces of the font.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed incorrect message about real error when menu\n  names are not correctly built.\n- [compareFamily] Fixed test for improbable FontBBOX to use em-square\n  rather than assume 1000 em.\n- [compareFamily] Added warning if widths of ligatures are not larger\n  than the width of the first glyph.\n- [compareFamily] Added warning if accented glyphs have a width different\n  than their base glyph.\n- [compareFamily] Added error message if two faces in the same family\n  have the same OS/2 width and weight class and italic style setting, and\n  are not optical size variants. Optical size check is crude: the Adobe\n  standard optical size names (Caption, Capt, Disp, Ds, Subh, Six) are\n  removed from the PS font names and then compared; if the PS names are\n  the same, then they are assumed to be optical size variants.\n- [compareFamily] Added check that no hint is outside the FontBBox, for\n  CJK fonts only.\n- [spot/otfproof] Added \"Korean\" to list of tags for OS/2 codepage range.\n- [spot/otfproof] Fixed dump of 'size' feature to support correct and old\n  versions\n- [spot/otfproof] Added dump/proof of contextual chaining positioning\n  format 3.\n- [spot/otfproof] Added warnings that only low-level dump of other\n  contextual lookups is supported.\n- [makeotf] Program is now a stand-alone C executable.\n- [makeotf] Removed option to write contextual positioning rules in the\n  _old_ incorrect format.\n- [makeotf] MakeOTF no longer assigns Unicode Private Use Area values\n  to glyphs for which it cannot identify. To use PUAs, explicitly assign\n  them in the GlyphOrderAndAlias file.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug in name table name ID \"Version\": if version decimal\n  value is x.000, then the value in the Version name ID string was x.001.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug in handling of DFLT language script: it's now\n  possible to use this tag.\n- [makeotf] Fixed feature file parsing bug where 'dflt' lookups in one\n  feature were applied to the following feature if the following feature\n  started with a language statement other than 'dflt'.\n- [makeotf] Fixed serious bug where wrong width is calculated for glyphs\n  where the CFF font Type 2 charstring for the glyph starts with a width\n  value. This is then followed by the value pairs for the coordinates for\n  the vertical hint, and then these are followed by a hint mask or control\n  mask operator. The bug was that when MakeOTF reads in the charstring in\n  order to derive the hmtx width, it discards the data before the control\n  mask operator, leading the parser to use the CFF default width for the\n  glyph.\n- [makeotf] vhea.caretSlopeRise and vhea.caretSlopeRun is now set to 0\n  and 1 respectively, rather than the opposite.\n- [makeotf] The OS/2 table 'fsType' field is now set to the feature file\n  override. If not supplied, then the value of the environment variable\n  FDK_FSTYPE. If not set then 4 (Preview & Print embedding).\n- [makeotf] Added support for contextual chaining positioning of base\n  glyphs; mark and anchors not yet supported.\n- [makeotf] Fixed bug in 'size' feature: the feature param offset is now\n  set to the offset from the start of the feature table, not from from the\n  start of the FeatureList table.\n- [makeotf] Allowed 'size' feature point sizes to be specified as\n  decimal points, as well as in integer decipoints.\n- [makeotf] OS/2 table version is now set to 3.\n- [makeotf] Added OS/2 overrides for winAscent and winDescent.\n- [makeotf] Added hhea overrides for Ascender/Descender/LineGap.\n- [makeotf] Set OS/2 Unicode coverage bits only if the font has a\n  reasonable number of glyphs in the Unicode block; it was setting the\n  bits if the font had even one glyph in the block.\n- [makeotf] The \"Macintosh\" codepage bit in the OS/2 codePageRange fields\n  is now set by default.\n- [FEA spec] Fixed incorrect range example in section _2.g.ii. Named\n  glyph classes_\n- [FEA spec] Changed rule to allow lookup definitions outside of feature\n  definitions in FDK 2.0.\n- [FEA spec] Fixed incorrect uses of 'DFLT' rather than 'dflt' for a\n  language tag.\n\n1.6.8139 (released 2005-08-30)\n------------------------------\n\n- [OTFProof] Fixed error in dumping GSUB table: GSUB lookup 5,\n  context lookup assumed that there were both a lookahead and a backtrack\n  sequence.\n- Updated SING META table tags to latest set.\n\n1.6.7974 (released 2004-08-30)\n------------------------------\n\n- [makeotf] Fixed rule in building CJK font. When looking for Adobe\n  CMap files, will no longer use a hardcoded max supplement value when\n  building paths to try.\n\n1.6.7393 (released 2004-01-14)\n------------------------------\n\n- [compareFamily] Fix stack dump when family has no BlueValues\n  (reported by House Industries).\n- [compareFamily] Fix stack dump when CFF-CID font has glyph with no\n  `subr` calls.\n- [OTFProof] Corrected error in last release, where spaces between\n  ligature match string names were omitted.\n- [FontLab macros] Added scripts for testing if the joins in a\n  connecting script font design are good.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed crash on proofing or dumping feature file syntax for\n  GSUB lookup 5, context lookup. Also fixed rule-generating logic:\n  results were previously wrong for proof and for feature-file syntax\n  formats. Text dump has always been correct.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed crash when dumping cmap subtables that reference\n  virtual GIDs not in the font.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed crash on dumping GSUB lookup type 6 chaining context\n  subtable format 2. This has never worked before.\n- [OTFProof] Added demo for SING glyphlet tables, SING and META.\n- [FontLab macros] Added scripts for reading and writing an external\n  composites definition text file.\n- [FontLab macros] Added scripts for working with MM fonts.\n\n1.6.6864 (released 2003-10-08)\n------------------------------\n\n- [OTFProof] Fixed crash after dumping contents of ttc fonts (bug\n  introduced in version 6792).\n- [OTFProof] Fixed cmap subtable 4 and 2 dumps. Cmap subtable 2 could\n  show encoding values for single byte codes which were really the\n  first byte of two byte character codes. In Format 4, idDelta values\n  were not being added when the glyphindex was derived from the glyph\n  index array. These show issues show up in some TTF CJKV fonts.\n\n1.6.6792 (released 2003-09-24)\n------------------------------\n\n- [OTFProof] Fixed crash when proofing fonts with _many_ glyphs.\n- [OTFProof] Restored \"skipping lookup because already seen in\n  script/language/feature\" messages to proof file, which was lost in\n  version 6604.\n- [OTFProof] Added ability to proof resource fork sfnt fonts from Mac\n  OSX command line. It's still necessary to use the SplitForks tool to\n  make a data-fork only resource file, but spot/otfproof can now navigate\n  in the resulting AppleDouble formatted resource file.\n- [OTFProof] Added support for a text dump of the GDEF table.\n- [OTFProof] Changed title in 'size' feature dump from _Common\n  Characters_ to _name table name ID for common Subfamily name for size\n  group_.\n- [AGL] Fixed some minor errors in the Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts.\n\n1.6.6629\n--------\n\n- [OTFProof] Fixed bug in dumping KERN table from Mac sfnt-wrapped\n  resource fork Type 1 MM font.\n- [OTFProof] Changed the AFM-format dump of kern pairs to list all\n  kern pairs for each language/script combination in separate blocks, and\n  to eliminate all class kern pairs that are masked by a singleton kern\n  pair. The temp buffer file path is now taken from the system C library\n  function tmpnam(), and is not necessarily in the current directory.\n\n1.6.6568\n--------\n\n- [OTFProof] Fixed command-line tool to write proof files in same\n  location as font, and with font-name prefix, when not auto-spooled for\n  printing.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed bug in UI version where proofing GSUB features and\n  then GPOS features would cause the GPOS feature proof files to be empty.\n- [makeotf] Fixed heuristics for picking OS/2 weight/width so that a\n  font name containing _ultracondensed_ would trigger only setting the\n  width, and not the weight as well.\n- Updated Mac OS project files to CodeWarrior 8.\n\n1.6.6564\n--------\n\n- [OTFProof] When dumping data from TTF fonts, now add `@<gid>` to all\n  glyph names. This is because the rules for deriving names can lead to\n  two glyphs being given the same name.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed bug in proofing GPOS class kern pairs: was generating\n  bogus kern pairs and duplicate kern pairs when the coverage format was\n  type 2. Affects proof file only, not AFM or feature-format dump.\n- Fixed memory overwrite bug encountered by Goichi and cleaned up various\n  memory leaks in the process.\n- [compareFamily] Added report on whether a face contains known std\n  charset. Stub implementation - still need list of std charsets.\n- [AFM2Feat] Developed tool to convert an AFM file to a file with\n  kern feature `pos` rules.\n\n1.6.6148\n--------\n\n- Rebuilt all libraries for v1.6 release 3/10/2003.\n\n1.6.6048\n--------\n\n- Updated FinishInstall.py to reflect Python 2.2 requirements.\n- Picked up last MakeOTF.pdf editing changes.\n- Fixed bug in GOADB.\n- Updated CID font data in example fonts.\n- Updated FDK release notes and installation instructions.\n- Updated to use the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file developed while\n  converting the Adobe Type Library. Maps all the old glyph names to AGL\n  compatible names.\n\n1.6.6020\n--------\n\n- [OTFProof] Fixed crash in handling of VORG with no entries. (Vantive\n  574752)\n- [MakeOTF] Updated documentation: added a description of how all three\n  columns of the _GlyphOrderAndAliasDB_ file are used; added a new section\n  on the key-value pairs of the font project file; updated the description\n  of the FontMenuNameDB file entries; added minor clarifications throughout.\n- Updated _digital_signature_guide.htm_ to match current Verisign website.\n- [Example fonts] Changed the incorrect language keyword TUR to TRK.\n- [Example fonts] Removed the many key/value pairs in the fontinfo files\n  that are not used by MakeOTF.\n- [OTFProof/spot] Fixed 3-column handling of GOAADB. (Vantive 569681)\n\n1.6.5959\n--------\n\n- [MakeOTF] Suppressed the \"repeat hint substitution discarded\" message\n  from the source file parsing library. These are so common that they\n  obscure more useful messages.\n- [MakeOTF] Set as default the option to build chaining contextual\n  substitution rules with the incorrect format used by InDesign 2.0 and\n  earlier.\n- [MakeOTF] If the option above is set, then MakeOTF will write a name\n  ID (1,0,0,5 - \"Version\") which will contain the text string which\n  triggers special case code in future Adobe apps so that it will process\n  the chaining contextual substitution rules as they were intended. If\n  this option is NOT set, the name ID 5 will be written so as to not\n  trigger this special case code. The special case treats specially any\n  font where the name table name ID (1,0,0,5) exists and either matches,\n\n        \"OTF[^;]+;PS[^;]+;Core 1\\.0\\.[23][0-9].*\"\n\n  (example: \"OTF 1.006;PS 1.004;Core 1.0.35\")\n  or contains,\n\n        \"Core[^;]*;makeotf\\.lib\"\n\n  (example: \"Core 1.0.38;makeotf.lib1.5.4898\")\n  or just,\n\n        \"Core;makeotf.lib\"\n\n- [MakeOTF] Turn off by default the option to force the .notdef glyph\n  in the output OTF font be an crossed rectangle with an advance width\n  of 500.\n- [MakeOTF] Added rule to force the OS/2 WeightClass to always be at\n  least 250. Shows error message if set or calculated WeightClass was less\n  than this.\n- [MakeOTF] Added test that FSType is set the same in the feature file\n  as in source CID font files.\n- [OTFProof] Page layout for CJKV font vertical layout: now writes the\n  vertical columns right to left.\n- [OTFProof] When writing vertical features, now shows the advance width\n  sign as negative.\n- [OTFProof] When making PostScript proof file, now writes DSC tags with\n  correct header and page info.\n- Added _Unicode and Glyph Name_ documentation to the FDK _Technical\n  Documentation_ directory, to allow access to this info under the FDK\n  license.\n\n1.6.4908\n--------\n\n- [MakeOTF/FEA syntax] Added new vmtx table overrides, to allow setting\n  vertical metrics for pre-rotated proportional glyphs that are\n  specifically designed and are not simply rotated forms of proportional\n  glyphs.\n- [MakeOTF/FEA syntax] Added new OS/2 overrides to set the Unicode and\n  Windows codepage range fields: UnicodeRange CodePageRange.\n- [MakeOTF/FEA syntax] Updated language keywords to be consistent with\n  OpenType spec, i.e using `dflt` instead of `DFLT`. Expanded section\n  explaining use of language and script default keywords. Old keywords\n  still work, but cause a warning to be emitted.\n- [FEA syntax] Expanded explanation of kern class pairs and subtable\n  breaks.\n- [MakeOTF] Updated the search rules for CID font CMap files to support\n  Adobe-Japan2-0, and to look first for UTF-32 CMAP files.\n\n1.5.4987\n--------\n\n- Release to Adobe website Sept 2002.\n\n1.5.4908\n--------\n\n- [MakeOTF] Changed the name table version string to match OT spec 1.4.\n- [CompareFamily] Made it _really_ work with Sept 10th 2002 release of\n  Just van Rossum's FontTools library.\n\n1.5.4492\n--------\n\n- [MakeOTF] (hotlib 1.0.35) Fixed the error in processing GSUB\n  contextual chaining substitution format 3. This was originally done\n  according to the OpenType spec 1.4, which is in error by the\n  established implementation of VOLT and Uniscribe. Added option '-fc' to\n  cause the library to use the incorrect implementation, according to OT\n  spec v1.4. By default, MakeOTF builds the correct contextual format\n  per spec v1.5.\n- [MakeOTF] (hotlib 1.0.35) Fixed Unicode cmap bug in assigning the OS/2\n  table field usLastCharIndex. This is supposed to be the highest Unicode\n  value in the BMP-16 cmap tables. The problem was in the logic by which\n  alternates of supplemental plane glyph names were being assigned an EUS\n  code, but not added to the BMP-16 Unicode cmap tables, e.g. u1D269.alt.\n  When one of these alternates was assigned an EUS value, the\n  usLastCharIndex was getting bumped even though the glyph was not being\n  added to the BMP-16 cmap tables. Fixed by not incrementing\n  usLastCharIndex in this case.\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed bug in applying client-supplied Unicode override\n  values. These were omitted if the glyph names in the font were different\n  than the final glyph names, as can happen when the client uses the\n  getFinalGlyphName call back to supply a glyph production name which is\n  different than the final glyph name.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed crash when proofing liga feature in CID font. Also\n  fixed crash when proofing charstring with only one operand, e.g\n  h/r/vmoveto.\n- [CompareFamily] Updated to use the latest version of Just van Rossum's\n  FontTools library, added support for TrueType fonts. Now requires Python\n  2.2.\n- [CompareFamily] Added family test 11: verify that for base font in\n  style-linked group, Mac and Windows menu names are the same, and that\n  for other fonts in the style linked group, the Mac and Windows menu\n  names  differ.\n\n1.5.4099\n--------\n\n- External release of FDK 1.5 on Adobe website.\n\n1.5.3849\n--------\n\n- [CompareFamily] Fixed tabular glyph and isFixedPitch test so that they\n  are now useful - used to generate far too many false errors.\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed bug in setting Panose values from a feature file\n  override. If any value in the Panose value string is 0, all subsequent\n  values were also set to 0.\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed bug where glyphs that got renamed were not subjected\n  to the ordering specified by the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file.\n- Added FDK.py file to integrate all tools into a common UI.\n- [OTFCompare] Added use of CFFChecker library for CFF table.\n- [CFFChecker] Added resource fork handling on OSX.\n- [CompareFamily] Added family test 10: if any face in family has a real\n  panose value, report derived panose values as an error.\n- [CompareFamily] Fixed bug  in comparing copyright notices in family\n  test 7: will now really report error only if differs in other than years.\n- [CFFChecker] Added support for multiple input files.\n- [CFFChecker] Added support for resource fork fonts under MacOS 9.\n- Added CFFChecker interface to makeotf.\n- [OTFCompare] Added OSX prompt-based support.\n- Fix R-O-S mapping for CMAP files.\n- Fixed getunicodeCmap() to not hard-wire Adobe-Japan1-3 when processing\n  J fonts.\n- [CFFChecker] MacOS 9 version created.\n- Added CFFChecker.\n- [CompareFamily] Fixed to not die on font menu names with non-std ASCII.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed vertical metrics proofing.\n- [MakeOTF] Added warning when truncating OS/2 TypoAscender to force its\n  sum with TypoDescender to be equal to the em-box.\n- [MakeOTF] Allow fractional synthetic weight values. These are rounded\n  to an integer.\n- [MakeOTF] Changed XUID adding algorithm to NOT add the revision number\n  to the XUID array.\n- [MakeOTF] In release mode, add current year to copyright, suppress (c)\n  string, and fix spaces around the phrase 'All Rights Reserved'.\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed to permit building a font in release mode with no\n  unique ID at all.\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed bad cmap entry offset calculation.\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed for bad cmap table entry.\n\n1.5.1023\n--------\n\n- [MakeOTF] Changed algorithm for adjusting advance width/lsb/rsb of\n  non-slanted synthetic glyphs when adding to italic fonts.\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed failure of re-ordering when NOT forcing use of marking\n  notdef.\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed interaction between 'Sigma' and synthetic 'summation',\n  'Pi' and 'product'.\n- [spot] Added the option to select which feature to dump in GPOS or\n  GSUB=7 dumps.\n- [OTFProof] Added support of TT instructions in compound glyphs.\n- [CompareFamily] Fixed incorrect unwrapping T2 charstring subroutines.\n  All previous reports on whether glyphs were hinted should be doubted.\n- [MakeOTF] Tweaked horizontal spacing of upright glyphs in oblique fonts.\n- [MakeOTF] Added support for \"italicangle\", \"width\" and \"weight\" keywords\n  in FontMenuNameDB.\n- [SCM/makeotf/typecomp] Fixed Euro-adding bug.\n- [OTFProof] Removed header note \"1000 units/em\" from proofs.\n- [OTFProof] Added support for cmap version 12.\n- [OTFProof] Removed zero padding of CID values from text reports.\n- [OTFProof] Reduced number of warnings about missing characters.\n- [OTFProof] Removed warning when GPOS and GSUB table may be too big,\n  as no tools make this error anymore, and it is triggered\n  inappropriately when font uses the extension lookup.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed different spacing problem reported. (Vantive 420313)\n- [OTFProof] Fixed so that vertical proofs write from right to left.\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed problem with unspecified CMap files.\n\n1.5.600\n-------\n\n- [CompareFamily] Fixed so that it will not error out when one of the\n  Blues arrays is not present.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed so that glyph names for CID fonts print properly.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed problems with compile under SunOS.\n- [MakeOTF] Added MakeOTFScript.py as an example file to edited, in\n  order to allow scripting of makeOTF on the Mac (or any other platform).\n  Minor changes to MakeOTF.py to fix this.\n- [MakeOTF] Added an option to allow removing deprecated Type 1 operands\n  from output font (e.g. `seac` and `dotsection`).\n- [MakeOTF] Added an option to allow adding synthesized glyphs to fonts,\n  leveraging a built-in sans and serif multiple master substitution font.\n  The source font must contain a 'zero' and a capital 'O'.\n  The glyphs that can be synthesized are:\n\n        Euro\n        Delta\n        Omega\n        approxequal\n        asciicircum\n        asciitilde\n        at\n        backslash\n        bar\n        brokenbar\n        currency\n        dagger\n        daggerdbl\n        degree\n        divide\n        equal\n        estimated\n        fraction\n        greater\n        greaterequal\n        infinity\n        integral\n        less\n        lessequal\n        litre\n        logicalnot\n        lozenge\n        minus\n        multiply\n        notequal\n        numbersign\n        onehalf\n        onequarter\n        paragraph\n        partialdiff\n        perthousand\n        pi\n        plus\n        plusminus\n        product\n        quotedbl\n        quotesingle\n        radical\n        section\n        summation\n        threequarters\n        zero\n\n1.4.583\n-------\n\n- Began tracking files by Perforce changelist label, from the Perforce\n  source code management system.\n- Updated compilers to Mac/CodeWarrior 6 Pro, Windows Visual C++ 6.0.\n- Re-organized build directories to have mac/win/sun4 subdirectories.\n- Re-organized shared include files to all be under /Programs/api, with\n  non-conflicting names.\n- [Example fonts] Updated MinionPro-Capt: now has correct frac and size\n  features.\n- [Example fonts] Added KozMinPro to samples.\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed bug where fontinfo keyword IsStyleBold was ignored for\n  CID fonts.\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed Mac build project to load debug and release libraries\n  by different names.\n- [MakeOTF] Added feature file support for the \"languagesystem\" statement.\n  Note that this entailed removing support for script, language, and named\n  lookup statements in the size feature, and removing support for script and\n  language statements in the aalt feature. See feature file spec for details.\n- [MakeOTF] More descriptive wording in offset overflow error messages.\n  Feature file error handling improved: multiple error messages are emitted\n  before failing if possible, instead of just one; final glyph name as well\n  as glyph alias (if applicable) reported if not found in font.\n- [MakeOTF] Changed the 14 Corporate Use subarea Unicode values for Zapf\n  Dingbats to the proposed UVs in anticipation of their being incorporated\n  into the Unicode standard.\n- [MakeOTF] Added FontWorks ('FWKS') to vendor ID list.\n- [MakeOTF] Increased the maximum number of named lookups allowed to 8192.\n- [MakeOTF] Now makes kern and vert features from kern data passed in by\n  clients and from V CMap (respectively) only when the HOT_CONVERSION bit is\n  set. (Previously, these features were made from the sources mentioned\n  above if they weren't already defined in a feature file.)\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed an obscure bug in OS/2.ulUnicodeRange computation: if\n  the largest UV in the font were not in any Unicode range recognized by\n  hotlib then it was counted as being in the next recognized Unicode range\n  after the UV. (No known fonts are affected by this.)\n- [MakeOTF] Forced the OS/2 codepage range bits for Chinese to either\n  Simplified or Traditional, based on the Mac cmap script, if it is defined\n  as either Simplified or Traditional, and will fall back to the heuristics\n  if the script is undefined. If the mac.script is something other than a\n  Chinese script, then the OS/2 codepage range bits for Chinese will not\n  be set.\n- [OTFCompare] The Python sys.path variable must now contain the path\n  to the directory containing the OTFProof library (usually\n  _FDK/Tools/Programs/otfproof/exe_). This replaces the hardcoded path\n  reference in the OTFCompare.py script. On all platforms, this is done\n  by adding the file \"otfproof.pth\", containing the path, to the Python\n  installation.\n- [OTFCompare] Fixed a bug that was causing tables smaller than 16 bytes\n  to be reported as different\n- [OTFProof] Added new proofing mode to CFF_ to print one glyph per page.\n- [OTFProof] Added new proofing option to suppress file-specific header\n  info to facilitate diff-ing of multiple proofs.\n- [OTFProof] Added alphabetical sorting of AFM-style dump.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed bug causing GPOS/GSUB features with digits in their\n  names to not appear in the proofing list.\n- [OTFProof] Added support for glyphsize option in CFF_ dumps.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed conflicting include file names; must now specify\n  include paths in project file.\n- [OTFProof] Reduced some of the recursion in the subroutinization code\n  to reduce stack space requirements.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed support for included feature files in parent folder\n  on the Mac.\n\n1.3.2 (2000-10-24)\n------------------\n\n- [OTFProof] Fixed bug where would report error opening Mac TTF suitcase\n  font, because data fork was of size 0.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed bug where feature tags containing numbers were filtered\n  out of the feature list for proofing.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed bug where baseline was shown incorrectly for CJK fonts\n  with baselines other than 120.\n- [OTFProof] Fixed bug where y-placement changes were not shown correctly\n  in vertical writing mode proofs.\n\n1.3.1 (2000-08-15)\n------------------\n\n- [MakeOTF] Fixed problem with heuristics for OS/2 codepage range\n  settings, for Chinese Simplified vs Traditional.\n- [MakeOTF] Added macro to define MakeOTF version number.\n- [MakeOTF] updated makeotflib help/usage messages: shown when args are\n  incorrectly formatted.\n\n- [makeotf] (makeotf/exe/makeotfutils.py)\n\n  - added fontinfo list entry for \"Language\".\n  - added 'parameter' variable entry for same.\n  - increased num values to from 34 to 35.\n  - changed initialization of 'parameter' so can more easily figure out\n    which index matches which fontinfo field.\n\n- [makeotf] (makeotf/exe/makeotf.py)\n\n  - updated version numbers to 1.3.1.\n  - added '-cs' and '-cl' options to help.\n  - added processing of Language field, to set script and language IDs\n    with '-cs' and '-cl' options.\n\n- [makeotf] (makeotf/source/main.c)\n\n  - added macro to define MakeOTF version number, used in help message,\n    and in client name string for name id 5 \"Version\".\n  - added mac_script and mac_language fields to global static 'convert'\n    structure.\n  - added processing of '-cs' and '-cl' arguments to parse_args().\n  - added mac_script and mac_language arguments to call to cbconvert().\n  - updated print_usage to match that of makeotf.py.\n  - updated the ReadFontInfo() to process new Language field.\n\n- [makeotf] (makeotf/source/cb.c)\n\n  - moved initialization (as type unknown) of mac.encoding, mac.script\n    and mac.language from cbconvert to cbnew().\n  - added setting of mac.script and mac.language to cbconvert(), from\n    arguments.\n  - added mac_script and mac_language arguments to call to cbconvert().\n\n- [makeotf] (source/includes/cb.h)\n\n  - added mac_script and mac_language arguments to call to cbconvert().\n\n- [hotconvlib] (coretype/source/map.c)\n\n  - changed logic for setting OS/2 codepage range to set code page to\n    Simplified or Traditional Chinese based on mac.script setting;\n    fallback on heuristics only if mac.script is not set.\n\n\n",

To work around this problem\n(which really only impacts the few core afdko developers who need to get live\nfeedback as they modify the source files) you can use alternative methods like\nexporting a PYTHONPATH, using a .pth file or similar hacks.\nFor further details read <a href=\"https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/pull/677#issuecomment-436747212\" rel=\"nofollow\">this comment</a>.</p>\n<h2>Major changes from version 2.5.x</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The AFDKO has been restructured so that it can be installed as a Python\npackage. It now depends on the user's Python interpreter, and no longer\ncontains its own Python interpreter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two programs, <strong>IS</strong> and <strong>checkoutlines</strong> were dropped because their source\ncode could not be open-sourced. These tools are available in <a href=\"https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/releases?after=2.6.22\" rel=\"nofollow\">release version\n2.5.65322 and older</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong></p>\n<p>If you install the old AFDKO as well as the new PyPI afdko package, the tools from\nthe newer version will take precedence over the older. This happens because pip\nadds the afdko's package path at the beginning of the system's PATH environment\nvariable, whereas the old installer adds it at the end; this modification to PATH\nis not undone by the uninstaller. If you want to completely remove the path to the\nnewer version, you will have to edit the PATH. On the Mac, this means editing the\nline in your login file that sets the PATH variable. On Windows, this means editing\nthe PATH environment variable in the system's Control Panel.</p>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<h2>3.3.0 (released 2020-05-01)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[otf2ttf] update LSB in hmtx to

Incidentally removed old patent notices.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] Restored old check for the fatal error of two\ndifferent glyphs being mapped to the same character encoding.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] If the last line of a GOADB file did not end in a\nnew-line, makeotf quit, saying the line was too long.</li>\n<li>[otf2otc] Can now take a single font as input, and can take an OTC\nfont as input.</li>\n<li>[sfntdiff] Fixed old bug: it used to crash if no file path or only\none file path was provided.</li>\n<li>[sfntdiff] Changed behavior: it now returns non-zero only if a\nreal error occurs; it used to return non-zero when there was a\ndifference between the fonts.</li>\n<li>[spot] Fixed old bug: a PrivateDict must exist, but it is legal\nfor it to have a length of 0.</li>\n<li>[tx <em>et al.</em>] Add support for reading and writing blended hints\nfrom/to CFF2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.65811 (released 2017-04-27)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[makeInstancesUFO] Preserve public.postscriptNames lib key.</li>\n<li>[makeInstancesUFO] Do not use postscriptFontName attribute.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] New option -V to print MakeOTF.py script version.</li>\n<li>[tx] Added new option '-maxs', to set the maximum number of\nsubroutines allowed. The default is now 32K, as some legacy systems\ncannot support more than this.</li>\n<li>[tx] Add improved CFF2 support: tx can now use the option -cff2 to\nwrite from a CFF2 font (in a complete OpenType font) to a file\ncontaining the output CFF2 table, with full charstring optimization\nand subroutinization. This last option is still work in progress: it\nhas not been extensively tested, and does yet support blended hints.</li>\n<li>[tx] Several bug fixes for overlap removal.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed bug in subroutinization that could leave a small number\nof unused subroutines in the font. This cleanup is optional, as it\nrequires 3x the processing speed with the option than without, and\ntypically reduces the font size by less than 0.5 percent.</li>\n<li>[ttxn] Option '-nv' will now print name IDs 3 and 5, but with\nthe actual version number replaced by the string \"VERSION\nSUPPRESSED\".</li>\n<li>[ufoTools] FIx autohint bug with UFO fonts: if edit a glyph and\nre-hint, autohint uses old processed layer glyph.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.65781 (released 2017-04-03)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[variable fonts] <strong>buildMasterOTFs</strong> new script to build OTF font\nfiles from UFO sources, when building variable fonts.</li>\n<li>[variable fonts] <strong>buildCFF2VF</strong> new command to build a CFF2\nvariable font from the master OTF fonts.</li>\n<li>[autohint] Fixed bug introduced by typo on Dec 1 2015. Caused\nBlueFuzz to always be set to 1. Rarely causes problems, but found it\nwith font that sets BlueFuzz to zero; with BlueFuzz set to 1, some\nof the alignment zones were filtered out as being closer than\nBlueFuzz*3.</li>\n<li>[autohint] Fixed long-standing bug with UFO fonts where if a glyph\nwas edited after being hinted, running autohint would process and\noutput only the old version of the glyph from the processed layer.</li>\n<li>[CheckOutlinesUFO] Added \"quiet mode\" option.</li>\n<li>[CheckOutlinesUFO] Fixed a bug where logic could try and set an\noff-curve point as a start point.</li>\n<li>[CheckOutlinesUFO] Changed the logic for assigning contour order\nand start point. The overlap removal changes both, and\ncheckOutlinesUFO makes some attempt to restore the original state\nwhen possible. These changes will result in different contour order\nand start points than before the change, but fixes a bug, and will\nusually produce the same contour order and start point in fonts that\nare generated as instances from a set of master designs. There will\nalways be cases where there will be some differences.</li>\n<li>[MakeOTF] Replace old logic for deriving relative paths with\npython function for the same.</li>\n<li>[MakeOTF] When converting Type 1 to CID in makeotf, the logic in\nmergeFonts and ConvertFontToCID.py was requiring the FDArray\nFontDicts to have keys, like FullName, that are not in fact\nrequired, and are often not present in the source fonts. Fixed both\nmergeFonts and ConvertFontToCID.py.</li>\n<li>[MakeOTF] By default, makeotf will add a minimal stub DSIG table\nin release mode. The new options '-addDSIG' and '-omitDSIG' will\nforce makeotf to either add or omit the stub DSIG table. This\nfunction was added because the Adobe Type group is discontinuing\nsigning font files.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] Fixed bug in processing UVS input file for makeotf\nfor non-CID fonts.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] Fixed bug where makeotf would reject a nameID 25\nrecord when specified in a feature file. This nameID value used to\nbe reserved, but is now used for overriding the postscript family\nnamed used with arbitrary instances in variable fonts.</li>\n<li>[mergeFonts] Removed requirement for mergeFonts that each FontDict\nhave a FullName, Weight, and Family Name. This fixes a bug in using\nmergeFonts with UFO sources and converting to CID-keyed output font.\nDevelopers should not have to put these fields in the source fonts,\nsince they are not required.</li>\n<li>[spot] Fixed bug in name table dump: Microsoft platform language\ntags for Big5 and PRC were swapped.</li>\n<li>[stemHist] Removed debug print line, that caused a lot of annoying\noutput, and was left in the last update by accident.</li>\n<li>[tx] When getting Unicode values for output, the presence of UVS\ncmap meant that no UV values were read from any other cmap subtable.\nI fixed this bug, but 'tx' still does not support reading and\nshowing UVS values. Doing so will be a significant amount of work,\nso I am deferring that to my next round of FDK work.</li>\n<li>[tx] Added support for CFF2 variable fonts as source fonts: when\nusing -t1 or -cff, these will be snapshotted to an instance. If no\nuser design vector (UDV) argument is supplied, then the output will\nbe the default data. If a UDV argument is supplied with the option\n-U, then the instance is built at the specified point in the design\nspace.</li>\n<li>[tx] Added new option +V/-V to remove overlaps in output Type 1\nfonts (mode -t1) and CFF fonts (mode -cff). This is still\nexperimental.</li>\n<li>[tx] Made the subroutinizer a lot faster; the speed bump is quite\nnoticeable with CJK fonts. (by Ariza Michiharu)</li>\n<li>[tx] Added new option (+V/-V) to remove overlaps. (by Ariza\nMichiharu)</li>\n<li>[ttx] Updated to version 3.9.1 of the fontTools module from master\nbranch on GitHub.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.65322 (released 2016-05-27)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[CMAP files] Updated UniCNS-UTF32-H to v1.14</li>\n<li>[build] Made changes to allow compiling under Xcode 7.x and OSX\n10.11</li>\n<li>[documentation] Fixed a bunch of errors in the Feature File spec.\nMy thanks to Sascha Brawer, who has been reviewing it carefully. See\nthe issues at\n<a href=\"https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/issues/created_by/brawer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/issues/created_by/brawer</a>.</li>\n<li>[autohint] Fixed support for history file, which can be used with\nnon-UFO fonts only. This has been broken since UFO support was\nadded.</li>\n<li>[autohintexe] Fixed really old bug: ascenders and descenders get\ndropped from the alignment zone report if they are a) not in an\nalignment zone and b) there is an overlapping smaller stem hint.\nThis happened with a lot of descenders.</li>\n<li>[checkOutlines] Fixed bug in ufoTools.py that kept checkOutlines\n(NOT checkOutlinesUFO) from working with a UFO font.</li>\n<li>[checkOutlines] Fixed bug which misidentified orientation of path\nwhich is very thin and in part convex. I am a bit concerned about\nthe solution, as what I did was to delete some logic that was used\nto double-check the default rules for determining orientation.\nHowever, the default logic is the standard way to determine\norientation and should always be correct. The backup logic was\ndefinitely not always correct as it was applied only to a single\npoint, and was correct only if the curve associated with the point\nis concave. It is in fact applied at several different points on a\npath, with the majority vote winning. Since the backup logic is used\nonly when a path is very thin, I suspect that it was a sloppy\nsolution to fix a specific case. The change was tested with several\nlarge fonts, and found no false positives.</li>\n<li>[makeInstances] Fixed bug which produced distorted shapes for\nthose glyphs which were written with the Type 1 'seac' operator,\na.k.a. Type 1 composite glyphs.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] Fixed bug where using both kern format A and B in a\nsingle lookup caused random values to be assigned.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] Fixed bug where a format A kern value (a single\nvalue) would be applied to X positioning rather than Y positioning\nfor the features 'vkrn'. Applied same logic to vpal, valt, and\nvhal.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] Finally integrated Georg Seifert's code for\nsupporting hyphen in development glyph names. This version differs\nfrom Georg's branch in that it does not allow any of the special\ncharacters in final names (i.e. the left side names in the\nGlyphAliasAndOrderDB). However, allowing this is a smaller tweak\nthan it used to be: just use the same arguments in\n<code>cb.c:gnameFinalScan()</code> as in <code>gnameDevScan()</code>. This update also\nincludes Georg's changes for allow source fonts to have CID names\nin the form 'cidNNNN'.</li>\n<li>[ConvertToCID] Fixed bug that the script expected in several\nplaces that the fontinfo file would contain at least one user\ndefined FontDict.</li>\n<li>[ConvertToCID] Fixed bug that the script expected that the source\nfont would have Weight and Adobe Copyright fields in the font dict.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed a bug that kept the '-nS' option for having any\neffect when the '-cn' option is used.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] Remove use of 'strsep()'; function is not defined\nin the Windows C library.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed bug in removing duplicate and conflicting entries.\nChanged logic to leave the first pair defined out of a set of\nduplicate or conflicting entries.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] Fixed bug in processing GDEF glyph class statements:\nif multiple GlyphClass statements were used; the additional glyphs\nwere added to a new set of 4 glyph classes, rather than merged with\nthe allowed 4 glyph classes.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] Fixed issue in GDEF definition processing. Made it an\nerror to specify both LigCaretByPosition and LigCaretByIndex for a\nglyph.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] Corrected error message: language and system\nstatements are allowed in named lookups within a feature definition,\nbut are not allowed in stand-alone lookups.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Corrected typo in MakeOTF.py help text about what the\ndefault source font path.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] Fixed an old bug in makeotf. If a mark-to-base or\nmark-to-mark lookup has statements that do not all reference the\nsame mark classes, makeotfexe used to write a 'default' anchor\nattachment point of (0.0) for any mark class that was not referenced\nby a given statement. Fixed this bug by reporting a fatal error: the\nfeature file must be re-written so that all the statements in a\nlookup must all reference the same set of mark classes.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Suppressed warning about not using GOADB file when\nbuilding a CID font. Some of the changes I made a few weeks ago to\nallow building fonts with CIDs specified as glyphs names with the\nform 'cidNNNNN' allowed this warning to be be shown, but it is not\nappropriate for CID-keyed fonts.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed old bug where using option -'cn' to convert a\nnon-CID source font to CID would cause a mismatch between the maxp\ntable number of glyphs and the number of glyph actually in the output\nfont, because the conversion used the source font data rather than\nthe first pass name-keyed OTF which had been subject to glyph\nsubsetting with the GOADB file.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed bug in reading UVS files for non_CID fonts.</li>\n<li>Fixed copyright statements that are incompatible with the open\nsource license. Thanks to Dmitry Smirnov for pointing these out.\nThese were in some make files, an example Adobe CMAP file, and some\nof the technical documentation.</li>\n<li>Fixed typos in help text in ProofPDF.py. Thank you Arno Enslin.</li>\n<li>[ttxn] Fixed bug in ttxn.py that broke it when dumping some\ntables, when used with latest fontTools library.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed bug in rounding fractional values when flattening\nlibrary elements, used in design of CJK fonts.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed bug in handling FontDict FontMatrix array values: not\nenough precision was used, so that 1/2048 was written as 1/2049 in\nsome cases.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed bug in reading UFO fonts, so that glyphs with no\n<code>&lt;outline&gt;</code> element and with a <code>&lt;lib&gt;</code> element would be skipped.</li>\n<li>[tx] Minor code changes to allow 'tx' to compile as a 64 bit\nprogram.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed bug in dumping AFM format data, introduced when tx was\nupdated to be 64 bit.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed bug in processing seac, introduced in work on rounding\nfractional values.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed bug in writing AFM files: -1 value would be written as\n4294967295 instead of -1.</li>\n<li>[tx] Added option -noOpt, renamed blend operator from 'reserved'\nto 'blend'. This was done in order to support experiments with\nmultiple master fonts.</li>\n<li>[tx] When reading a UFO font: if it has no Postscript version\nentry, set the version to 1.0.</li>\n<li>[tx] When writing a UFO font: if StemSnap[H,V] are missing, but\nStd[H,V]W are present, use the Std[H,V]W values to supply the\nUFO's postscript StemSnap[H,V] values.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed old bug with rounding decimal values for BlueScale is\none of the few Postscript values with several places of decimal\nprecision. It is stored as an ASCII text decimal point number in T1,\nT2, and UFO files, but is stored internally as a C 'float' value\nin some programs. Real values in C cannot exactly represent all\ndecimal values. For example, the closest that a C 'float' value\ncan come to \"0.375\" is \"0.03750000149\".When writing output\nfonts, tx was writing out the latter value in ASCII text, rather\nthan rounding back to 0.0375. Fixed by rounding to 8 decimal places\non writing the value out. This bug had no practical consequences, as\n0.0375 and 0.03750000149 both convert to exactly the same float\nvalue, but was annoying, and could cause rounding differences in any\nprograms that use higher precision fields to hold the BlueScale\nvalue.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.65012 (released 2015-12-01)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed bug that kept makeotfexe from building fonts with\nspaces in the path.</li>\n<li>[ConvertFontToCID] Fixed bug that kept makeotf from converting UFO\nfonts to CID.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Changed support for Unicode Variation Sequence file\n(option '-ci') so that when used with name-keyed fonts, the\nRegion-Order field is omitted, and the glyph name may be either a\nfinal name or developer glyph name.

Rebuilt the 'antler' parser generator to get rid of a\ncompile-time warning for zzerraction, and changed featgram.g so that\nit would generate the current featgram.c, rather than having to edit\nthe latter directly. Deleted the object files for the 'antler'\nparser generator, and updated the read-me for the parser generator.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotfexe] Fixed really old bug: relative include file\nreferences in feature files have not worked right since the FDK\nmoved from Mac OS 9 to OSX.

In the previous release, autohintexe was changed to\nread and write fractional values. However, internal value storage\nused a Fixed format with only 7 bits of precision for the value.\nThis meant that underflow errors occurred with 2 decimal places,\nleading to incorrect coordinates. I was able to fix this by changing\nthe code to use 8 bits of precision, which supports 2 decimal places\n(but not more!) without rounding errors, but this required many\nchanges. The current autohint output will match the output of the\nprevious version for integer input values, with two exceptions.\nFractional stem values will (rarely) differ in the second decimal\nplace. The new version will also choose different hints in glyphs\nwhich have coordinate values outside of the range -16256 to +16256;\nthe previous version had a bug in calculating weights for stems.</li>\n<li>[autohint] Changed logic for writing bez files to write absolute\ncoordinate values instead of relative coordinate values. Fixed bug\nwhere truncation of decimal values lead to cumulative errors in\npositions adding up to more than 1 design unit over the length of a\npath.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed bugs in handling fractional values: <code>tx</code> had a bug with\nwriting fractional values that are very near an integer value for\nthe modes -dump, -svg, and -ufo. <code>tx</code> also always applied the logic\nfor applying a user transform matrix, even though the default\ntransform is the identity transform. This has the side-effect of\nrounding to integer values.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.64043 (released 2015-04-08)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[checkOutlinesUFO] Added new logic to delete any glyphs from the\nprocessed layer which are not in the 'glyphs' layer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] When building CID font, some error messages were printed\ntwice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Added new option <code>stubCmap4</code>. This causes makeotf to\nbuild only a stub cmap 4 subtable, with just two segments. Needed\nonly for special cases like AdobeBlank, where every byte is an\nissue. Windows requires a cmap format 4 subtable, but not that it be\nuseful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeCIDFont] Output FontDict was sized incorrectly. A function at\nthe end adds some FontInfo keys, but did not increment the size of\nthe dict. Legacy logic is to make the FontInfo dict be 3 larger than\nthe current number of keys.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeInstanceUFO] Changed AFDKO's branch of mutatorMath so that\nkern values, glyph widths, and the BlueValues family of global hint\nvalues are all rounded to integer even when the <code>decimal</code> option is\nused.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeInstanceUFO] Now deletes the default 'glyphs' layer of the\ntarget instance font before generating the instance. This solves the\nproblem that when glyphs are removed from the master instances, the\ninstance font still has them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeInstanceUFO] Added a new logic to delete any glyphs from the\nprocessed layer which are not in the 'glyphs' layer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeInstanceUFO] Removed the <code>all</code> option: even though\nmutatorMath rewrites all the glyphs, the hash values are still valid\nfor glyphs which have not been edited. This means that if the\ndeveloper edits only a few glyphs in the master designs, only those\nglyphs in the instances will get processed by checkOutlinesUFO and\nautohint.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support fractional coordinate values in UFO workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>checkOutlinesUFO (but not checkOutlines), autohint, and\nmakeInstancesUFO will now all pass through decimal\ncoordinates without rounding, if you use the new option\n\"decimal\". tx will dump decimal values with 3 decimal\nplaces.</li>\n<li>tx already reported fractional values, but needed to be\nmodified to report only 3 decimal places when writing UFO\nglif files, and in PDF output mode: Acrobat will not read\nPDF files with 9 decimal places in position values.</li>\n<li>This allows a developer to use a much higher precision of\npoint positioning without using a larger em-square. The\nAdobe Type group found that using an em-square of other than\n1000 design units still causes problems in layout and text\nselection line height in many apps, despite it being legal\nby the Type 1 and CFF specifications.</li>\n<li>Note that code design issues in autohint currently limit the\ndecimal precision and accuracy to 2 decimal places: 1.01\nworks but 1.001 will be rounded to 0.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.63782 (released 2015-03-03)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[tx] Fix bug in reading TTFs. Font version was taken from the name\ntable, which can include a good deal more than just the font\nversion. Changed to read fontRevision from the head table.</li>\n<li>[detype1] Changed to wrap line only after an operator name, so\nthat the coordinates for a command and the command name would stay\non one line.</li>\n<li>[otf2otc] Pad table data with zeros so as to align tables on a 4\nboundary. Submitted by Cosimo Lupo.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.63718 (released 2015-02-21)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[ufoTools] Fixed a bug with processing flex hints that caused\noutline distortion.</li>\n<li>[compareFamily] Fixed bug in processing hints: it would miss\nfractional hints, and so falsely report a glyph as having no hints.</li>\n<li>[compareFamily] Support processing CFF font without a FullName\nkey.</li>\n<li>[checkOutlinesUFO] Coordinates are written as integers, as well as\nbeing rounded.</li>\n<li>[checkOutlinesUFO] Changed save function so that only the\nprocessed glyph layer is saved, and the default layer is not\ntouched.</li>\n<li>[checkOutlinesUFO] Changed so that XML type is written as\n'UTF-8' rather than 'utf-8'. This was actually a change in the\nFontTools xmlWriter.py module.</li>\n<li>[checkOutlinesUFO] Fixed typos in usage and help text.</li>\n<li>[checkOutlinesUFO] Fixed hash dictionary handling so that it will\nwork with autohint, when skipping already processed glyphs.</li>\n<li>[checkOutlinesUFO] Fixed false report of overlap removal when only\nchange was removing flat curve</li>\n<li>[checkOutlinesUFO] Fixed stack dump when new glyph is seen which\nis not in hash map of previously processed glyphs.</li>\n<li>[checkOutlinesUFO] Added logic to make a reasonable effort to sort\nthe new glyph contours in the same order as the source glyph\ncontours, so the final contour order will not depend on (x,y)\nposition. This was needed because the pyClipper library (which is\nused to remove overlaps) otherwise sorts the contours in (x,y)\nposition order, which can result in different contour order in\ndifferent instance fonts from the same set of master fonts.</li>\n<li>[makeInstancesUFO] Changed so that the option -i (selection of\nwhich instances to build) actually works.</li>\n<li>[makeInstancesUFO] Removed dependency on the presence of\ninstance.txt file.</li>\n<li>[makeInstancesUFO] Changed to call checkOutlinesUFO rather than\ncheckOutlines</li>\n<li>[makeInstancesUFO] Removed hack of converting all file paths to\nabsolute file paths: this was a work-around for a bug in\nrobofab-ufo3k that is now fixed.</li>\n<li>[makeInstancesUFO] Removed all references to old instances.txt\nmeta data file.</li>\n<li>[makeInstancesUFO] Fixed so that current dir does not have to be\nthe parent dir of the design space file.</li>\n<li>Merged fixes from the GitHub AFDKO open source repo.</li>\n<li>Updated to latest version defcon, fontMath, robofab, and\nmutatorMath.</li>\n<li>Fix for Yosemite (Mac OSX 10.10) in FDK/Tools/setFDKPaths. When an\nAFDKO script is ran from another Python interpreter, such as the one\nin RoboFont, the parent Python interpreter may set the Unix\nenvironment variables PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH. This can cause the\nAFDKO Python interpreter to load some modules from its own library,\nand others from the parent interpreters library. If these are\nincompatible, a crash ensues. The fix is to unset the variables\nPYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH before the AFDKO interpreter is called.\nNote: As a separate issue, under Mac OSX 10.10, Python calls to FDK\ncommands will only work if the calling app is run from the\ncommand-line (e.g: <code>open /Applications/RoboFont.app</code>), and the\nargument <code>shell=\"True\"</code> is added to the subprocess module call to\nopen a system command. I favor also adding the argument\n<code>stderr=subprocess.STDOUT</code>, else you will not see error messages\nfrom the Unix shell. Example:\n<code>log = subprocess.check_output( \"makeotf -u\", stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, shell=True)</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.63408 (released 2014-12-02)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[spot] Fixed error message in GSUB chain contextual 3 proof file\noutput; was adding it as a shell comment to the proof output,\ncausing conversion to PDF to fail.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Increased the limit for glyph name length from 31 to 63\ncharacters. This is not encouraged in shipping fonts, as there may\nbe text engines that will not accept glyphs with more than 31\ncharacters. This was done to allow building test fonts to look for\nsuch cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.63209 (released 2014-09-18)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[makeInstancesUFO] Added new script to build instance fonts from\nUFO master design fonts. This uses the design space XML file\nexported by Superpolator 3 in order to define the design space, and\nthe location of the masters and instance fonts in the design space.\nThe definition of the format of this file, and the library to use\nthe design space file data, is in the open source mutatorMath\nlibrary on GitHub, and maintained by Erik van Blokland. There are\nseveral advantages of the Superpolator design space over the\nprevious <strong>makeInstances</strong> script, which uses the Type 1 Multiple\nMaster font format to hold the master designs. The new version a)\nallows different master designs and locations for each glyph, and b)\nallows master designs to be arbitrarily placed in the design space,\nand hence allows intermediate masters. In order to use the\nmutatorMath library, the AFDKO-supplied Python now contains the\nrobofab, fontMath, and defcon libraries, as well as mutatorMath.</li>\n<li>[ttx] Updated to the latest branch of the fontTools library as\nmaintained by Behdad Esfahbod on GitHub. Added a patch to cffLib.py\nto fix a minor problem with choosing charset format with large glyph\nsets.</li>\n<li>Updated four Adobe-CNS1-* ordering files.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.63164 (released 2014-09-08)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[makeotf] Now detects <code>IsOS/2WidthWeightSlopeOnly</code> as well as the\nmisspelled <code>IsOS/2WidthWeigthSlopeOnly</code>, when processing the\nfontinfo file.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] Changed behavior when 'subtable' keyword is used in\na lookup other than class kerning. This condition now triggers only\na warning, not a fatal error. Change requested by FontForge\ndevelopers.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed bug which prevented making TTF fonts under\nWindows. This was a problem in quoting paths used with the 'ttx'\nprogram.</li>\n<li>Fixed installation issues: removed old Windows install files from\nthe Windows AFDKOPython directory. This was causing installation of\na new AFDKO version under Windows to fail when the user's PATH\nenvironment variable contained the path to the AFDKOPython\ndirectory. Also fixed command file for invoking ttx.py.</li>\n<li>Updated files used for building ideographic fonts with Unicode IVS\nsequences:\n<code>FDK/Tools/SharedData/Adobe Cmaps/Adobe-CNS1/Adobe-CNS1_sequences.txt</code>\nand <code>Adobe-Korea1_sequences.txt</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.62754 (released 2014-05-14)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[IS/addGlobalColor] When using the '-bc' option, fixed bug with\noverflow for CID value in dumping glyph header. Fixed bug in IS to\navoid crash when logic for glyphs &gt; 72 points is used.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] Fixed bug that applied '-gs' option as default\nbehavior, subsetting the source font to the list of glyphs in the\nGOADB.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.62690 (released 2014-04-30)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[makeotf] When building output TTF font from an input TTF font,\nwill now suppress warnings that hints are missing. Added a new\noption '-shw' to suppress these warnings for other fonts that with\nunhinted glyphs. These warnings are shown only when the font is\nbuilt in release mode.</li>\n<li>[makeotfexe] If the cmap format 4 UTF16 subtable is too large to\nwrite, then makeotfexe writes a stub subtable with just the first\ntwo segments. The last two versions allowed using '-' in glyph\nnames. Removed this, as it breaks using glyph tag ranges in feature\nfiles.</li>\n<li>Updated copyright, and removed patent references. Made extensive\nchanges to the source code tree and build process, to make it easier\nto build the open source AFDKO. Unfortunately, the source code for\nthe <strong>IS</strong> and <strong>checkOutlines</strong> programs cannot be open sourced.</li>\n<li>[tx/mergeFonts/rotateFont] Removed '-bc' option support, as\nthis includes patents that cannot be shared in open source.</li>\n<li>[tx] All tx-related tools now report when a font exceeds the max\nallowed subroutine recursion depth.</li>\n<li>[tx/mergeFonts/rotateFont] Added common options to all when\npossible: all now support UFO and SVG fonts, the '-gx' option to\nexclude fonts, the '-std' option for cff output, and the '-b'\noption for cff output.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.61944 (released 2014-04-05)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[makeotf] Added new option '-gs'. If the '-ga' or '-r'\noption is used, then '-gs' will omit from the font any glyphs\nwhich are not named in the GOADB file.</li>\n<li>[Linux] Replaced the previous build (which worked only on 64-bit\nsystems) with a 32 bit version, and rebuilt checkOutlines with debug\nmessages turned off.</li>\n<li>[ttx] Fixed FDK/Tools/win/ttx.cmd file so that the 'ttx' command\nworks again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.61911 (released 2014-03-25)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[makeotf] Add support for two new 'features' file keywords, for\nthe OS/2 table. Specifying 'LowerOpSize' and 'UpperOpSize' now\nsets the values 'usLowerOpticalPointSize' and\n'usUpperOpticalPointSize' in the OS/2 table, and set the table\nversion to 5.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed the '-newNameID4' option so that if the style\nname is \"Regular\", it is omitted for the Windows platform name ID\n4, as well as in the Mac platform version. See change in\nbuild 61250.</li>\n<li>[tx] When the user does not specify an output destination file\npath (in which case tx tries to write to stdout), tx now reports a\nfatal error if the output is a UFO font, rather than crashing.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed crash when encountering an empty <code>&lt;dict/&gt;</code> XML\nelement.</li>\n<li>[spot] Added logic to dump the new fields in OS/2 table version 5,\n<strong>usLowerOpticalPointSize</strong> and <strong>usUpperOpticalPointSize</strong>. An\nexample of these values can be seen in the Windows 8 system font\nSitka.TTC.</li>\n<li>[ufo workflow] Fixed autohint and checkOutlines so that the '-o'\noption works, by copying the source UFO font to the destination UFO\nfont name, and then running the program on the destination UFO font.</li>\n<li>[ufo workflow] Fixed tools that the PostScript font name is not\nrequired.</li>\n<li>Added Linux build.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.61250 (released 2014-02-17)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[tx] Fixed rare crashing bug in reading a font file, where a\ncharstring ends exactly on a refill buffer boundary.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed rare crashing bug in subroutinization.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed bug where it reported values for wrong glyph with more\nthan 32K glyphs in the font.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed bug where the tool would not dump a TrueType Collection\nfont file that contained OpenType/CFF fonts.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed issue where it failed to read a UFO font if the UFO\nfont lacked a fontinfo.plist file, or a psFontName entry.</li>\n<li>[IS] Fixed IS so that it no longer scales the fontDict FontMatrix,\nwhen a scale factor is supplied, unless you provide an argument to\nrequest this.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] The option '-newNameID4' now builds both Mac and Win\nname ID 4 using name ID 1 and 2, as specified in the OpenType spec.\nThe style name is omitted from name ID 4 it is \"Regular\".</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Changed logic for specifying ValueFormat for PosPair\nvalue records. Previous logic always used the minimum ValueFormat.\nSince changing ValueFormat between one PosPair record and the next\nrequires starting a new subtable, feature files that used more than\none position adjustment in a PosPair value record often got more\nsubtable breaks then necessary, especially when specifying a PairPos\nstatement with an all zero Value Record value after a PairPos\nstatement with a non-zero Value Record. With the new logic, if the\nminimum ValueFormat for the new ValueRecord is different than the\nValueFormat used with the ValueRecord for the previous PairPos\nstatement, and the previous ValueFormat permits expressing all the\nvalues in the current ValueRecord, then the previous ValueFormat is\nused for the new ValueRecord.</li>\n<li>Added commands <strong>otc2otf</strong> and <strong>otf2otc</strong> to build OpenType\ncollection files from a OpenType font files, and vice-versa.</li>\n<li>[ttx] Updated the FontTools library to the latest build on the\nGitHub branch maintained by Behdad Esfahbod, as of Jan 14 2014.</li>\n<li>[ufo workflow] Fixed bugs in ufoTools.py. The glyph list was being\nreturned in alphabetic order, even when the public.glyphOrder key\nwas present in lib.py. Failed when the glyphOrder key was missing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.60908 (released 2013-10-21)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[tx] Can now take UFO font as a source font file for all outputs\nexcept rasterization. It prefers GLIF file from the layer\n<code>glyphs.com.adobe.type.processedGlyphs</code>. You can select another\npreferred layer with the option '-altLayer <code>&lt;layer name&gt;</code>'. Use\n'None' for the layer name in order to have tx ignore the preferred\nlayer and read GLIF files only from the default layer.</li>\n<li>[tx] Can now write to a UFO with the option '-ufo'. Note that it\nis NOT a full UFO writer. It writes only the information from the\nPostscript font data. If the source is an OTF or TTF font, it will\nnot copy any of the meta data from outside the font program table.\nAlso, if the destination is an already existing UFO font, tx will\noverwrite it with the new data: it will not merge the new font data\nwith the old.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed bugs with CID values &gt; 32K: used to write these as\nnegative numbers when dumping to text formats such as AFM.</li>\n<li>[autohint/checkOutlines] These programs can now be used with UFO\nfonts. When the source is a UFO font, the option '-o' to write to\nanother font is not permitted. The changed GLIF files are written to\nthe layer 'glyphs.com.adobe.type.processedGlyphs'. Each script\nmaintains a hash of the width and marking path operators in order to\nbe able to tell if the glyph data in the default layer has changed\nsince the script was last run. This allows the scripts to process\nonly those glyphs which have changed since the last run. The first\nrun of autohint can take two minutes for a 2000 glyph font; the\nsecond run takes less then a second, as it does not need to process\nthe unchanged glyphs.</li>\n<li>[stemHist/makeotf] Can now take UFO fonts as source fonts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.60418 (released 2013-02-26)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[autohint] Now skips comment lines in fontinfo file.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Added support for source font files in the 'detype1'\nplain text format. Added logic for \"Language\" keyword in fontinfo\nfile; if present, will attempt to set the CID font makeotf option\n-\"cs\" to set he Mac script value.</li>\n<li>[compareFamily] Added check in Family Test 10 that font really is\nmonospaced or not when either the FontDict isFixedPitch value or the\nPanose value says that it is monospaced.</li>\n<li>[spot] Fixed bug that kept 'palt'/'vpal' features from being\napplied when proofing kerning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.59149 (released 2012-10-31)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] When building OpenType/TTF files, changed logic to copy\nthe OS/2 table usWinAscent/Descent values over the head table\nyMax/yMin values, if different. This was because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>both pairs are supposed to represent the real font bounding box\ntop and bottom,and should be equal;</li>\n<li>the TTF fonts we use as sources for makeotf are built by FontLab;</li>\n<li>FontLab defines the font bounding box for TrueType fonts by using\noff-curve points as well as on-curve points. If a path does not have\non-curve points at the top and bottom extremes, the font bounding\nbox will end up too large. The OS/2 table usWinAscent/Descent\nvalues, however, are set by makeotf using the converted T1 paths,\nand are more accurate. Note that I do not try to fix the head table\nxMin and xMax. These are much less important, as the head table yMin\nand yMax values are used for line layout by many apps on the Mac,\nand I know of no application for the xMin and yMin values.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Changed default Unicode H CMAP file for Adobe-Japan1 CID\nfonts to use the UniJIS2004-UTF32-H file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added the CID font vertical layout files used with KozMinPr6N and\nKozGoPr6N: AJ16-J16.VertLayout.KozGo and AJ16-J16.VertLayout.KozMin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Updated several Unicode CMAP files, used only with CID fonts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added new Perl script, glyph-list.pl, used in building CID fonts.\nThis replaces the three scripts extract-cids.pl, extract-gids.pl,\nand extract-names.pl, which have been removed from the AFDKO.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.58807 (released 2012-09-13)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[makeotf] Discovered that when building TTF fonts, the GDEF table\nwas not being copied to the final TTF font file. Fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.58732 (released 2012-09-04)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[autohint] Added new feature to support sets of glyphs with\ndifferent baselines. You can now specify several different sets of\nglobal alignment zones and stem widths, and apply them to particular\nsets of glyphs within a font when hinting. See option '-hfd' for\ndocumentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[autohint] Allow AC to handle fonts with no BlueValues, aka\nalignment zones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[autohint] Respect BlueFuzz value in font.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[autohint] Fixed the options to suppress hint substitution and to\nallow changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[autohint] When hinting a font with no alignment zones or invalid\nalignment zones (and with the '-nb' option), set the arbitrary\nalignment zone outside the FontBBox, rather than the em-square.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[checkOutlines] Fixed bug where the arms of an X would be falsely\nidentified as coincident paths, when they are formed by only two\npaths with identical bounding boxes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[checkOutlines] Fixed bug where very thin elements would get\nidentified as a tiny sub path, and get deleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[checkOutlines] Fixed bug in determining path orientation. Logic\nwas just following the on-path points, and could get confused by\nnarrow concave inner paths, like parentheses with an inner contour\nfollowing the outer contour, as in the Cheltenham Std HandTooled\nfaces.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[checkOutlines] Fixed bugs in determining path orientation.\nPrevious logic did not handle multiple inner paths, or multiple\ncontained outer paths. Logic was also dependent on correctly sorting\npaths by max Y of path bounding box. Replaced approximations with\nreal bezier math to determine path bounding box accurately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[checkOutlines] Changed test for suspiciously large bounding box\nfor an outline. Previous test checked for glyph bounding box outside\nof fixed limits that were based on a 1000 em square. The new test\nlooks only for paths that are entirely outside a rectangle based on\nthe font's em square, and only reports them: it does not ever\ndelete them. Added new option '-b' to set the size of the design\nsquare used for the test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[checkOutlines] Fixed bug where it would leave a temp file on disk\nwhen processing a Type 1 font.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[checkOutlines] Removed test for coincident control points. This\nhas not been an issue for decades. It is frequently found in fonts\nbecause designers may choose to not use one of the two control\npoints on a curve. The unused control point then has the same\ncoordinates as its nearest end-point, and would to cause\ncheckOutlines to complain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[compareFamily] Single Test 6. Report error if there is a patent\nnumber in the copyright. Adobe discovered that a company can be sued\nif it ships any product with an expired patent number.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[compareFamily] Single Test 22 (check RSB and LSB of ligature vs.\nthe left and right ligature components) did not parse contextual\nligature substitution rules correctly. Now fixed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[compareFamily] Family Test 18. Survive OTF fonts with no blue\nvalues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[compareFamily] Family Test 2 (Check that the Compatible Family\ngroup has same nameIDs in all languages): Added the WPF nameIDs 21\nand 22 to the exception list, which may not exist in all faces of a\nfamily.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[fontsetplot] Fixed so it works with CID fonts. Also fixed so that\nwidow line control works right. Added new low level option for\ncontrolling point size of group header.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[fontsetplot] Fixed syntax of assert statements. Produced error\nmessages on first use of the *plot commands.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[kernCheck] Fix so that it survives fonts with contextual kerning.\nIt does not, however, process the kern pairs in contextual kerning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fixed bug in mark to ligature. You can now use an\n<code>&lt;anchor NULL&gt;</code> element without having to follow it by a dummy mark\nclass reference.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fixed bug which limited source CID fonts to a maximum of\n254 FDArray elements, rather than the limit of 255 FDArray elements\nthat is imposed by the CFF spec.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fixed bugs in automatic GDEF generation. When now GDEF\nis defined, all conflicting class assignments in the GlyphClass are\nfiltered out. If a glyph is assigned to a make class, that\nassignment overrides any other class assignment. Otherwise, the\nfirst assignment encountered will override a later assignment. For\nexample, since the BASE class is assigned first, assignment to the\nBASE class will override later assignments to LIGATURE or COMPONENT\nclasses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fix bug in validating GDEF mark attachment rules. This\nnow validates the rules, rather than random memory. Had now effect\non the output font, but did sometimes produce spurious error\nmessages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fix crashing bug when trying to report that a glyph\nbeing added to a mark class is already in the mark class.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] If the OS/2 code page bit 29 (Macintosh encoding) is\nset, then also set bit 0 (Latin (1252). Under Windows XP and Windows\n7, if only the Mac bit is set, then the font is treated as having no\nencoding, and you cannot apply the font to even basic Latin text.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] By default, set Windows name ID 4 (Full Name) same as\nMac nameID 4, instead of setting it to the PostScript name. This is\nin order to match the current definition of the name ID 4 in the\nlatest OpenType spec. A new option to makeotf ('-useOldNameID4'),\nand a new key in the fontinfo file (\"UseOldNameID4\"), will cause\nmakeotf to still write the PS name to Windows name ID 4.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Add support for WPF names, name ID 21 and 22.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fixed attachment order of marks to bug in generating\nMark to Ligature (GPOS lookup type 4). The component glyphs could be\nreversed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fixed bug in auto-generating GDEF table when Mark to\nMark (GPOS lookup Type 4) feature statements are used. The target\nmark glyphs were registered as both GDEF GlyphClass Base and Mark\nglyphs, and the former took precedence. makeotfexe now emits a\nwarning when a glyph gets assigned to more than one class when\nauto-generating a GDEF table GlyphClass, and glyphs named in mark to\nmark lookups are assigned only to the Mark GDEF glyph class.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fixed bugs in generating TTF fonts from TTF input. It\nnow merges data from the head and hhea tables, and does a better job\nof dealing with the 'post' table. The previous logic made\nincorrect glyph names when the glyphs with names from the Mac Std\nEncoding were not all contiguous and at the start of the font.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Added new option '-cn' for non-CID source fonts, to\nallow reading multiple global font alignment zones and stem widths\nfrom the fontinfo file, and using this to build a CID-keyed CFF\ntable with an identity CMAP. This is experimental only; such fonts\nmay not work in many apps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fixed bug where the coverage table for an element in the\nmatch string for a chaining contextual statement could have\nduplicate glyphs. This happens when a glyph is specified more than\nonce in the class definition for the element. The result is that the\nformat 2 coverage table has successive ranges that overlap: the end\nof one range is the same glyph ID as the start of the next range;\nharmless, but triggers complaints in font validators.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Updated to latest Adobe CMAP files for ideographic\nfonts. Changed name of CMAP directories in the AFDKO, and logic for\nfinding the files.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] When providing a GDEF feature file definition, class\nassignments now may be empty:</p>\n<pre><code>  table GDEF {\n      GlyphClassDef ,,,;\n  } GDEF;\n</code></pre>\n<p>is a valid statement. You just need to provide all three commas and\nthe final colon to define the four classes. The following statement\nbuilds a GDEF GlyphClass with an empty Components class.</p>\n<pre><code>  table GDEF {\n      GlyphClassDef [B], [L], [M], ;\n  } GDEF;\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] The glyph alias file now defines order in which glyphs\nare added to the end of the target font, as well as defining the\nsubset and renaming.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] The <code>-cid &lt;cidfontinfo&gt;</code> option for converting a\nfont to CID can now be used without a glyph alias file, if the\nsource font glyphs have names in the form \"cidXXXX\", as is output\nwhen mergeFonts is used to convert from CID to name-keyed. If the\n<code>-cid &lt;cidfontinfo&gt;</code> option is used, and there is no glyph alias\nfile, then any glyphs in the font without a name in the form\n\"cidXXXX\" will be ignored.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Added error message for duplicate glyph IDs in coverage\ntables with format 2, a problem caused by a bug in makeotf with some\nAdobe fonts that use chaining contextual substitution. Note: error\nmessage is written only if level 7 GSUB/GPOS dump is requested.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Minor formatting changes to the GSUB/GPOS level 7 dump, to\nmake it easier to edit this into a real feature file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] When writing out feature file syntax for GPOS 'ignore\npos' rules, the rule name is now written as 'ignore pos', not\njust 'ignore'.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Can now output glyph names up to 128 chars (Note: these are\nnot legal PostScript glyph names, and should be encountered only in\ndevelopment fonts.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Has new option '-ngid' which suppresses output of the\ntrailing glyph ID <code>@&lt;gid&gt;</code> for TTF fonts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] No longer dumps the DefaultLangSys entry when there is\nnone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Changed dump logic for contextual and chain contextual\nlookups so that spot will not dump the lookups referenced by the\nsubstitution or position rules in the contextual lookups. The\nprevious logic led to some lookups getting dumped many times, and\nalso to infinite loops in cases where a contextual lookup referenced\nother contextual lookups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Added support for Apple kern subtable format 3. Fixed old\nbug causing crash when dumping font with Apple kern table from\nWindows OS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Fixed error when dumping Apple kern table subtable format\n0, when kern table is at end of font file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Fixed crashing bug seen in DejaVuSansMono.TTF: spot did not\nexpect an anchor offset to be zero in a Base Array base Record.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Removed comma from lookupflag dump, to match feature file\nspec.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Added logic to support name table format 1, but it probably\ndoes not work, since I have been unable to find a font to test with\nthis format.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Fixed spelling error for \"Canadian\" in OS/2 code page\nfields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Changed dump of cmap subtable 14: hex values are\nuppercased, and base+UVS values are written in the order [base,\nuvs].</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[stemHist] Always set the alignment zones outside the font BBox,\nso as to avoid having the source font alignment zones affect\ncollection of stem widths.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[stemHist] Fix bug where the glyph names reported in the stem and\nalignment reports were off by 1 GID if the list of glyphs included\nthe '.notdef' glyph.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[tx] Added support for option '-n' to remove hints for writing\nType 1 and CFF output fonts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[tx] Added new option \"+b\" to the cff output mode, to force\nglyph order in the output font to be the same as in the input font.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[tx] Fixed bug in flattening 'seac' operator. If the glyph\ncomponents were not in the first 256 glyphs, then the wrong glyph\nwould be selected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[tx] Added new library to read in svg fonts as a source. tx can\nnow read all the SVG formats that it can write. Handles only the\npath operators: M, m, L, L, C, c, Z, z, and the font and glyph\nattributes: 'font-family', 'unicode', 'horiz-adv-x',\n'glyph-name', 'missing-glyph'.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[tx] Fixed bug in converting TTF to OpenType/CFF. It flipped the\nsign of the ItalicAngle in the 'post' table, which in turn flipped\nthe sign of the OS/2 table fields ySubscriptXOffset and\nySuperscriptXOffset. This bug showed up in TTF fonts built by\nmakeotf, as makeotf uses 'tx' to build a temporary Type 1 font\nfrom the source TTF.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[tx] Fixed bug where '-usefd' option was not respected, when\nconverting from CID to name-keyed fonts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Updated the internal Python interpreter to version 2.7.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Updated Adobe Cmaps/Adobe-Japan1 files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adobe-Japan1_sequences.txt</li>\n<li>UniJIS-UTF32-H</li>\n<li>UniJIS2004-UTF32-H</li>\n<li>UniJISX0213-UTF32-H</li>\n<li>UniJISX02132004-UTF32-H</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added several scripts related to CID font production:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cmap-tool.pl</li>\n<li>extract-cids.pl</li>\n<li>extract-gids.pl</li>\n<li>extract-names.pl</li>\n<li>fdarray-check.pl</li>\n<li>fix-fontbbox.pl</li>\n<li>hintcidfont.pl</li>\n<li>subr-check.pl</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.25466 (released 2012-03-04)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[charplot] This was non-functional since build 21898.

See the\n'IS' entry.</li>\n<li>[IS] Added new tool for \"intelligent scaling\". This uses the\nhinting in an MM font to keep glyph paths aligned when snapshotting\nfrom MM fonts. The improvement is most visible in glyphs with\nseveral elements that need to maintain alignment, such as percent\nand perthousand. It is also useful for the same reason when scaling\nfonts from a large em-square size to a smaller size. To be\neffective, the source MM font must be hinted and must have global\nalignment zones defined. The new font must be re-hinted. For\ninstances from MM fonts especially, it is a good idea to redo the\nalignment zones, as the blending of the MM base designs usually does\nnot produce the best alignment zones or stem widths for the instance\nfonts. makeInstances and \"Instance Generator\" scripts allow you to\npreserve these modifications when redoing the MM instance snapshot.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed generation of version 1.2 GDEF table to match the\nfinal OpenType spec version 1.6. This version is generated only when\nthe new lookup flag 'UseMarkFilteringSet\" is used.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed generation of names for stylistic alternates\nfeatures. There was a bug such that in some circumstances, the\nfeature table entry for the stylistic alternate feature would point\nto the wrong lookup table.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed generation of the reverse substitution lookup\ntype. This was unintentionally disabled just before the previous\nrelease.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed bugs in memory management of glyph objects. If the\nfont built, it was correct, but this bug could cause the font to\nfail to build.</li>\n<li>[spot] Fixed to dump GDEF table version 1.2 according to the final\nOpenType spec version 1.6.</li>\n<li>[spot] Fixed feature-format dump of the lookupflags\nMarkAttachmentType and UseMarkFilteringSet to give a class name as\nan argument, rather than a class index.</li>\n<li>[spot] Extended the GDEF table dump to provide a more readable\nform.</li>\n<li>[spot] Added dump formats for htmx and vtmx to show the advance\nand side bearing metrics for all glyphs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.5.21340 (released 2009-01-22)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[AGLFN] (Adobe Glyph List for New Fonts) Created new version 1.7.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[AGLFN] Reverted to the AGLFN v1.4 name and Unicode assignments\nfor Delta, Omega, and mu. The v1.6 versions were better from a\ndesigner's point of view, but we cannot use name-to-Unicode value\nmappings that conflict with the historic usage in the Adobe Glyph\nList 2.0.

It will now also look in the same directory as the\nsource font for a file named \"fontinfo\", and will attempt to add\nstem3 hints to the glyph which are listed by name in the name list\nfor the keys \"HCounterChars\" or \"VCounterChars\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[autohint] Fixed old bug where it would only pay attention to the\nbottom four of the top zone specified in the FontDict BlueValues\nlist. This results in more edge hints in tall glyphs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[autohint] Fixed special case when adding flex operator which\ncould result in an endless loop</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[autohint] Added 'logOnly' option, to allow collecting report\nwithout changing the font.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[autohint] Added option to specify which glyphs to exclude from\nautohinting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[autohint] Suppressed generation and use of <code>&lt;font-name&gt;.plist</code>\nfile, unless it is specifically requested.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[autohint] Fixed bug where an extremely complex glyph would\noverflow a buffer of the list of hints.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[checkOutlines] Improved overlap detection and path orientation:\nit will now work with outlines formed by overlapping many stroke\nelements, as is sometimes done in developing CJK fonts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[checkOutlines] added new test for nearly vertical or horizontal\nlines.

The presence in the feature file of\neither a 'vrt2' feature of vmtx table overrides will now cause\nthese tables to be written for both CID-keyed and name-keyed fonts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Added warning when a feature is referenced in the aalt\nfeature definition, but either does not exist or does not contribute\nany rules to the aalt feature.

This is rather ugly under the hood, but it\nworks. The MakeOTF.py Python script uses the tx tool to convert the\nTTF font to CFF data without changing glyph order or names. It then\nbuilds an OpenType/CFF font. It then uses the sfntedit tool to copy\nthe TTF glyph data to the OpenType font, and to delete the CFF\ntable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Added support for building Unicode Variation Selectors\nfor CID-keyed fonts, using the new cmap subtable type 14.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fixed bug with inheritance of default rules by scripts\nand languages in feature file feature definitions. Explicitly\ndefined languages were only getting default rules defined after the\nlast script statement, and when a script is named, languages of the\nscript which are not named got no rules at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fixed bug where you could not run makeotf when the\ncurrent directory is not the same is the source font's home\ndirectory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Set OS/2.lastChar field to U+FFFF when using mappings\nbeyond the BMP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Create the Mac platform name table font menu names by\nthe same rules as used for the Windows menu names. Add new keywords\nto the FontMenuNameDB file syntax. If you use the old keywords, you\nget the old format; if you use the new syntax, you get nameIDs 1, 2\nand 16 and 17 just like for the Windows platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fixed bug in name table font menu names: if you entered\na non-English Preferred name (\"f=\") and not a compatible family\nname (\"c=\"), you would end up with a nameID 16 but no nameID 17.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fixed bogus 'deprecated \"except\" syntax' message\nunder Windows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Fixed bug where contextual pos statements without\nbacktrack or lookahead context were writing as a non-contextual\nrule. Reported by Karsten Luecke.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Added new option to make stub GSUB table when no GSUB\nrules are present.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[makeotf] Added warning if the aalt feature definition references\nany feature tags that either do not exist in the font, or do not\ncontribute any rules that the aalt feature can use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[sfntdiff] Fixed so that only error messages are written to\nstderr; all others now written to stdout.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[sfntdiff] Fixed bug in dump of 'name' table: when processing\ndirectories rather than individual files, the name table text was\nnever updated after the first file for the second directory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Fixed option '-F' to show the contextual rule sub-lookup\nindices, and to flag those which have already been used by another\nlookup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] If a left side class 0 is empty, do not report it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] For GSUB/GPOS=7 FEA dump, give each class a unique name in\nthe entire font by appending the lookup ID to the class names. It\nwas just <code>[LEFTCLASS]()&lt;class index&gt;_&lt;subtable index&gt;</code>, but\nthese names are repeated in every lookup. It is now\n<code>LEFTCLASS_c&lt;class index&gt;_s&lt;subtable index&gt;_l&lt;lookup index&gt;</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] When a positioning value record has more than one value,\nprint the full 4 item value record. Previously, it would just print\nnon-zero values. This was confusing when dumping Adobe Arabic, as\nyou would see two identical values at the end of some pos rules. In\nfact, each of these pos rule does have two adjustment values, one\nfor x and one for y advance adjustment, that happen to be the same\nnumeric value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[spot] Fixed to write backtrack context glyphs in the right order.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[tx] Added option to NOT clamp design coordinates to within the\ndesign space when snapshotting MM fonts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[tx] Added option to subroutinize the font when writing to CFF.\nThis option is derived from the same code used by makeotfexe, but\ntakes only about 10% the memory and runs much faster. This should\nallow subroutinizing large CJK fonts that makeotfexe could not\nhandle. This is new code, so please test results carefully, i.e. if\nyou use it, always check that the flattened glyphs outlines from the\noutput font are identical to the flattened glyph outlines from the\ninput font.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ttxn] Added options to suppress hinting in the font program, and\nversion and build numbers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.0.27 (released 2007-11-10)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[compareFamily] Fixed Single Test 3 (reported by Mark Simonson and\nothers); the test should compare the Mac platform name ID 4 (name ID\n1 + space + name ID 2) with the target value, but was instead using\nthe value of the name ID 18 (Compatible Full Name).</li>\n<li>[compareFamily] Fixed Family Test 2 to print a report that helps\ndetermine which {platform, script, language, name ID} is present in\nsome fonts but not others.</li>\n<li>[IS] Fixed a bug where applying hint-based scaling can cause an\noff-by-1 error when the the <em>closepath</em> position is supposed to\ncoincide with the original <em>moveto</em>, leading to an effective final\n1-unit <em>lineto</em>, that may overlap the initial path. In the old MM\ndesign world, we worked around this issue by designing the MMs so\nthat there was always a one unit difference between a final <em>curveto</em>\npoint and the original <em>moveto</em>. FontLab doesn't support doing that\nautomatically, so when making an instance, <strong>IS</strong> will instead simply\nlook for cases where the <em>moveto</em> and <em>closepath</em> positions differ by\none unit, and move the <em>moveto</em> position to coincide with the\n<em>closepath</em> position.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed bug where specifying thousands of singleton kern\npairs could silently overflow offsets, and makeotf would build a bad\nfont without any warning. (reported by Adam Twardoch)</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Relative file paths can now be used even if the current\ndirectory is not the source font directory. Project files can now be\nsaved to directories other than the source font directory. Note that\npaths stored in project file are relative to the project file's\ndirectory. (reported by Andreas Seidel)</li>\n<li>[makeotf/spot] Added support for Unicode Variation Sequences (UVSes).\nSee MakeOTF User's Guide and\n<a href=\"http://unicode.org/reports/tr37/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unicode Technical Standard #37</a></li>\n<li>[spot] Fixed bug where contents of 'size' GPOS feature would be\nprinted for all dump levels.</li>\n<li>[spot] Fixed failure to process 'post' table format 4.0. which\noccurs in some Apple TT fonts, such as Osaka.dfont</li>\n<li>Updated Adobe-Japan-1 CMAP files for building CID fonts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.0.26 (released 2007-05-05)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>featurefile.plist</code> for BBedit.

It\nlists the error messages from the MS FontValidator tool that can be\nignored for OpenType/CFF fonts.</li>\n<li>[FontLab macros] Added InstanceGenerator. Another script for making\ninstances from an MM VFB font. It's simpler than MakeInstances macro.</li>\n<li>[FontLab macros] Removed debug statement in Set Start Points which\nblocked processing more than 50 glyphs.

The CFF spec does not support this operator.\nSome very old tools allow this to happen.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed a bug in decomposing glyphs that are defined as\ncomposite glyphs in a Type 1 source font. This bug caused the base\ncomponent to be shifted when then left side bearing of the composite\nglyph differs from that of the base glyph. This could be consequential,\nas FontLab has an option to not decompose composite glyphs when\ngenerating a Type 1 font.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed a bug in recognizing the \"Korea1\" order when trying\nto pick a default Mac cmap script ID from a CID-keyed font's ROS\n(Registry-Order-Supplement) field.</li>\n<li>[tx] Fixed a bug in decomposing pretty much all composite glyphs\nfrom Type 1 and CFF source fonts. It happened only when a Type 1 or\nCFF font was being subset, i.e. converted into a font with fewer\nglyphs. tx now has the option '+Z' to force this to occur.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.0.25 (released 2007-03-30)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[autohint] Added a new option to allow extending the list of glyph\nnames for which autohint will try to make counter hints.</li>\n<li>[autohint] Fixed bug where Type 2 operator stack limit could be\nexceeded when optimizing Type 2 charstrings during conversion from\nbez format.</li>\n<li>[autohint] Fixed bug in setting OtherBlues alignment zone values.</li>\n<li>[FontLab macros] The Autohint macro behaves quite differently when\nadding 'flex' hints is turned off; it makes more hint substitutions,\nsince these are not allowed within the segment of the outline that\ncontributes the 'flex' stem. Turned it on, so that hint results will\nbe the same as the command-line tool. This does not affect the outline\ndata.</li>\n<li>[checkOutlines] Fixed bug that prevented the reporting of two\nsuccessive points with the same coordinates. The code to convert from\nthe source outline data to bez format was suppressing zero-length line\nsegments, so the checkOutlines module never experienced the problem.</li>\n<li>[compareFamily] Added new options '-st n1,n2..' and '-ft n1,n2..' to\nallow executing only specific tests.</li>\n<li>[compareFamily] Fixed test \"Warn if a style-linked family group does\nnot have FamilyBlues\". When reporting the error that FamilyBlues differ\nin a style-linked family group (where at least one font does have real\nFamilyBlues), use BlueValues as implied FamilyBlues when the latter\nattribute is missing from a font. Same for FamilyOtherBlues.</li>\n<li>[compareFamily] Warn about zones outside of font's BBox only if the\nentire zone is outside of the BBox, not just one edge, and warn only\nfor BlueValue zones, not FamilyBlueValue zones.</li>\n<li>[compareFamily] Fixed fsType check. Complain if fsType is not 8 only\nfor Adobe fonts, determined by checking if the name table trademark\nstring is empty or contains \"Adobe\".</li>\n<li>[compareFamily] Fixed Single Face Test 3 to compare the CFF Full Name\nwith the name table Preferred Full Name (ID 18) rather than the Full\nName (ID 4).</li>\n<li>[compareFamily] Fixed bug where it failed with CID fonts, because it\nreferenced the \"Private\" dict attribute of the font's topDict, which\ndoes not exist in CID fonts.</li>\n<li>[compareFamily] Fixed 'size' test to support the format that indicates\nonly intended design size, where no range is supplied.</li>\n<li>[compareFamily] Fixed ligature width check to also check that left\nand right side bearings match those of the left and right components,\nand to use the 'liga' feature to identify ligatures and their components,\ninstead of heuristics based on glyph names.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Disallowed negative values in the feature file for the OS/2\ntable winAscent and winDescent fields.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed a bug where a lookup excluded with the <code>exclude_dflt</code>\nkeyword was nevertheless included if the script/language was specified\nwith a languagesystem statement.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed issue on Windows where a user would see a debug\nassert dialog when the OS/2 vendorID was not specified in the feature\nfile, and the Copyright string contained an 8-bit ASCII character, like\nthe 'copyright' character.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed issue on Windows where name ID 17 would be garbage if\nno FontMenuNameDB was supplied, and the PostScript name did not contain\na hyphen.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Added warning for Mac OSX pre 10.5 compatibility: total size\nof glyphs names plus 2 bytes padding per glyph must be less than 32K, or\nOSX will crash.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed crash that occurred if the feature file did not have\na languagesystem statement.</li>\n<li>[makeotf] Fixed bug in subroutinizer which allowed a subroutine stack\ndepth of up to 10, but the Type 1 and Type 2 specs allow only 9.

This replaces the hardcoded path\nreference in the OTFCompare.py script. On all platforms, this is done\nby adding the file \"otfproof.pth\", containing the path, to the Python\ninstallation.</li>\n<li>[OTFCompare] Fixed a bug that was causing tables smaller than 16

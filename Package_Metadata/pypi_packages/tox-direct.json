The on request variant also provides a **YOLO** option ((you only live once ;)) which means that everything is run in the host interpreter. This will change the host interpreter and is usually only safe and makes sense (or works at all) if tox is run in a virtual environment already.\n\n### static form \nif the testenv name contains the word **direct** it will be run in direct mode if tox-direct is installed.

The interpreter used throughout is `~/.virtualenvs/tmp` - the host interpreter that tox was started from.\n\nThe `normal` env ran in the isolated environment provided by tox. pytest was installed and so was the project itself (because no package is needed to install the project in development mode).

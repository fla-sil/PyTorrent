Ideally, your central media folder will be organized as a repository of folders, with one movie or TV show each, but subtidal will still work if they're not quite that tidy.\n\n## Installation\n\nUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install subtidal. From the command line:\n\n```bash\npip install subtidal\n```\n\n## Quickstart\n***Option 1:** From the command line*\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/Your-Movie-Folder\ndownload-subtitles\n```\nor, call `download-subtitles` and specify the path directly:\n```bash\ndownload-subtitles /path/to/your-movie-folder\n```\n\n***Option 2:** From Python*\n\n```python\nfrom subtidal.download import download\n\ndownload(\"./path/to/Your Movie Folder\")\n\n# you can also add optional parameters\ndownload(directory=\"./path/to/Your Movie Folder\", verbose=True)\n```\n\n![subtidal-demo](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1MlJQrVGaocV80jZX5W7kYpjjH2xPWxDP)\n\n## Motivation\n\nI hope this project is of use to you. I got frustrated (or rather, was very mildly inconvenienced) because some of the movies I downloaded online didn't come included with subtitles, and I often found myself having to pause the movie I was watching to manually download them from sites like opensubtitles.org](https://opensubtitles.org).\n\nFurthermore, even when subtitles *were* included with a movie, if the filename differed at all from the name of the movie, they weren't recognized by the Roku Media Player, so I set about to rectify that.\n\nI have a huge, network-attached-storage media folder that acts as the central repository for all of the movies I download online, and I wanted to create a package that could download missing subtitles for every movie in it in one fell swoop.\n\nI imagined that as I downloaded new movies and TV shows into this central repository, I'd be able to run the package periodically via a cron job on my Raspberry Pi, so I'd never have to suffer the loathsome indignity of watching a show without having subtitles available ever again. This package is my attempt to make that vision a reality (or to make some fun out of laziness, depending on how you look at it), and in so doing, make a package available to the public on PyPI, which I had never done before.\n\n### Additional function & parameter info in the docstring\n\n```python\ndef download_subtitles(directory, verbose=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes in a directory path, walks through the file tree, and downloads subtitles for any video files found.\n    Renames the subtitle file to match the video's name (in order to make it compatible with Roku Media Player.)\n\n    :param (str) directory: Directory where video files or folders are located.\n    :param (str) language : [optional] Desired language for subtitles, expressed as a 3-letter ISO-639-3 code.

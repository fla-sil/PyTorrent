On this physical\nmachine Quickstart sets up multiple virtual machines (VMs) and virtual networks\nusing libvirt.\n\nOne of the VMs is set up as **undercloud**, an all-in-one OpenStack cloud used\nby system administrators to deploy the **overcloud**, the end-user facing\nOpenStack installation, usually consisting of multiple VMs.\n\nYou will need a ``$VIRTHOST`` with at least **16 GB** of RAM, preferably **32\nGB**, and you must be able to ``ssh`` to the virthost machine as root without a\npassword from the machine running ansible.  Currently the virthost machine must\nbe running a recent Red Hat-based Linux distribution (CentOS 7.x, RHEL 7.x).\nOther distributions could work but will not be supported with out CI validation.\n\n..  note::\n    Running quickstart.sh commands as root is not suggested or supported.\n\nThe SSH server on your ``$VIRTHOST`` must be accessible via public keys for\nboth the root and stack users.\n\nA quick way to test that root to your virthost machine is ready to rock is::\n\n    ssh root@$VIRTHOST uname -a\n\nThe ``stack`` user is not added until the quickstart deploy runs, so this cannot\nbe tested in advance.  However, if you lock down on a per-user basis, ensure\n``AllowUsers`` includes ``stack``.\n\nTimeouts can be an issue if the SSH server is configured to disconnect users\nafter periods of inactivity.  This can be addressed for example by::\n\n    ClientAliveInterval 120\n    ClientAliveCountMax 720\n\nThe quickstart defaults are meant to \"just work\", so it is as easy as\ndownloading and running the ``quickstart.sh`` script.\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nCopyright 2015-2016 Red Hat, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may\nnot use this file except in compliance with the License.

This project provides a module that allows you to store the index in \r\n[Amazon AWS DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). This is particularly useful \r\nif you are using docker-registry's Amazon S3 driver for your Image Store. With DynamoDB \r\nyou will have a high-availability index to match the high-availability image store.\r\n\r\n# Table of Contents\r\n\r\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\r\n- [Configuration](#configuration)\r\n- [Manual install](#manual-install)\r\n- [Implementation Details](#implementation-details)\r\n\r\n# Quick start\r\n\r\nTODO - create document a Docker image configured to use this extension.\r\n\r\n# Configuration\r\n\r\nSee the [docker-registry](https://github.com/docker/docker-registry) project for details on \r\nconfiguring the docker-registry. This project uses the same configuration mechanism, an you \r\nmay add the configuration to the same configuration file used by docker-registry. The \r\nconfiguration used by this code is stored in the docker-registry config in the extensions \r\nsection: For example:\r\n\r\n    common: &common\r\n        # add the following\r\n        search_backend: docker_registry_index.dynamodb\r\n\r\n    extensions:\r\n        dynamodb_index:\r\n            database: _env:DYNAMODB_DATABASE:docker-registry\r\n            repository_table: _env:DYNAMODB_REPOSITORY_TABLE\r\n            version_table: _env:DYNAMODB_VERSION_TABLE\r\n            region: _env:DYNAMODB_REGION\r\n            access_key: _env:DYNAMODB_ACCESS_KEY\r\n            secret_access_key: _env:DYNAMODB_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\r\n\r\nIf you do not specify a `repository_table`, then the table name will be formed by adding `-repository` to the end of the `database` name. If you do not specify a `version_table`, then `-version` is added to the `database` name. Note that there is no concept of a database in DynamoDB, the `database` name here is simply used as a prefix for calculating the table names when no table names are specified in the configuration.\r\n\r\nThe `region` will default to the `s3_region`, which in turn defaults to 'us-east-1'.\r\n\r\nThe `access_key` and `secret_access_key` default to the value of the `s3_access_key` and `s3_secret_access_key` respectively. If not specified then you must configure these by other means. This code uses [boto Python interface to Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/boto/boto) to access the DynamoDB. Therefore, you can use a boto configuration file in your home directory, or in /etc. For details see the [boto configuration](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/) documentation.\r\n\r\nSo if you use the DynamoDB with no configuration specified it will default to using 'docker-registry-repository' as the `respository_table` name, and 'docker-registry-version' as the `version_table` name. The region, access_key and secret_access_key will default to the S3 values or whatever is found in boto configuration. But remember, you must still set the search_backend to docker_registry_index.dynamodb.\r\n\r\n# Manual Install\r\n\r\nSimply install and run the docker-registry as normal, but first ensure that this python package (docker-registry-index-dynamodb) is installed and set the docker-registry configuration to use it.\r\n\r\n* Install docker-registry as normal.\r\n* Install this python package. \r\n  * Available at PYPI: `pip install docker-registry-index-dynamodb`\r\n* Make sure the docker-registry configuration has the `search_backend` set to `docker_registry_index.dynamodb`.\r\n* Optionaly set other configuration as specified above and in the docker-registry project.\r\n* Run the docker-registry.\r\n  * Installing the docker-registry also installs a `docker-registry` command.\r\n\r\n# Implementation details\r\n\r\n## Startup\r\n\r\nAt startup the Index class (the one that does all the work) checks to see if the configured DynamoDB table names exist, and if not, create them. \r\n\r\nIf the tables were created, then the repositories already located in the data store (which is presumably the s3 data store) will be loaded into the repository table. This means that you can delete the DynamoDB tables, and they will be reloaded when the docker-registry is started. You should probably not delete the tables while the docker-registry is running, although they are only used for query.\r\n\r\nA simple lock is used in the Index constructor to prevent multiple threads attempting to create and/or load the database at the same time.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/donlaidlaw/docker-registry-index-dynamodb", "keywords": "docker registry index dynamodb", "license": "Apache License\r\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\r\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\r\n\r\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n   1.

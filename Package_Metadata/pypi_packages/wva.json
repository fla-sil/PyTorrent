It contains both\ngeneral web services helpers (using the Python requests library) as well\nas more specific helpers.\n\nIn addition, packaged with the library is a command-line utility using\nthe API that serves as both an example of how the library may be used as\nwell as a convenient tool for developer use.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe library may be installed using pip by doing the following:\n\n::\n\n    pip install wva\n\nThis will install both the library and command-line application.\n\nCLI Usage\n---------\n\nHelp for the CLI application can be obtained by running the application\nwith the ``--help`` option. This will show the available commands:\n\n::\n\n    $ wva --help\n    Usage: wva [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n      Command-line interface for interacting with a WVA device\n\n    Options:\n      --https / --no-https  Use HTTPS instead of HTTP\n      --hostname TEXT       Force use of the specified hostname\n      --username TEXT       Force use of the specified username\n      --password TEXT       Force use of the specified password\n      --config-dir TEXT     Directory containing wva configuration files\n      --help                Show this message and exit.\n\n    Commands:\n      cliconfig      View and clear CLI config\n      delete         DELETE the specified URI Example: $ wva get...\n      get            Perform an HTTP GET of the provided URI The...\n      post           POST file data to a specific URI Note that...\n      put            PUT file data to a specific URI Example: $...\n      subscriptions  View and Edit subscriptions\n      vehicle        Vehicle Data Commands\n\nYou can get help for a specific command by specifying ``--help`` after\nthe command. For instance,\n\n::\n\n    $ wva subscriptions --help\n    Usage: wva subscriptions [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n      View and Edit subscriptions\n\n    Options:\n      --help  Show this message and exit.\n\n    Commands:\n      add     Add a subscription with a given short_name...\n      clear   Remove all registered subscriptions Example:...\n      delete  Delete a specific subscription by short name\n      graph   Present a live graph of the incoming...\n      list    List short name of all current subscriptions\n      listen  Output the contents of the WVA event stream...\n      show    Show metadata for a specific subscription...\n\nThe first time you attempt to talk to a device, you will need to provide\ncredentials for talking to the device. The CLI application will then\nstore those credentials in the file ``~/.wva/config.json`` and attempt\nto use those credentials in the future. If the credentials are ever\ninvalid, you will be prompted to enter the credentials again.\n\nYou can clear the credentials that are stored by deleting the wva\nconfiguration or by running the following command:\n\n::\n\n    $ wva cliconfig clear\n\nLibrary Usage and Examples\n--------------------------\n\nSee the `Full API\ndocumentation <https://digidotcom.github.io/python-wvalib>`__ for full\ndetails on the API and its usage.

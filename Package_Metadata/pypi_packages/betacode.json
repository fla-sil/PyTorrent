Tested on python 3.4,\n3.5, and 3.6. The definition used is based off what is found at the `TLG\nBeta Code Manual <http://www.tlg.uci.edu/encoding/BCM.pdf>`__. Only the\nGreek sections were paid attention to.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nI was working a classics research project and had to use the Perseus\ncatalog to extract some Greek work. Much to my surprise however, the\nonly download I could find was a betacode version. An encoding that is\nover 30 years old, rather than modern, fancy, clean unicode. There was\nno nice pip package that I could easily go to for this simple task, so I\ndecided to roll my own.\n\nInstall\n~~~~~~~\n\nInstallation is easy. Use ``pip`` or your preferred method to download\nfrom PyPI.\n\n::\n\n    pip install betacode\n\nUsage\n~~~~~\n\nNote that in all examples, strings are unicode encoded. Input can be in\nupper or lower case. The official definition from TLG uses only\nuppercase, but many resources, such as the Perseus catalog, are encoded\nin lowercase, so this package accepts both. This package also can\ndisregard the unnecessary cannonical order of Greek diacritics from the\nofficial definition. The only thing that matters in order for the\nbetacode to be unambiguous is that each unit must either begin with a\n``*`` or a letter. As long as these constraints are followed, breathing\nmarks, accents, and such can go in any order. However, the cannonical\norder will be returned when going from unicode to betacode. Also note\nthat currently, only individual, non-combining characters are handled.\nThis means that you cannot do all combinations of letters and\ndiacritics. Only those defined as composite characters in the Greek and\nExtended Greek sections of unicode.\n\nBetacode to unicode\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n::\n\n    import betacode.conv\n\n    beta = 'analabo/ntes de\\ kaq\\' e(/kaston'\n    betacode.conv.beta_to_uni(beta) # \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u1f79\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u1fbd \u1f15\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\n\nNote that polytonic accent marks will be used, and not monotonic accent\nmarks. Both are de jure equivalent in Greece, but betacode was initially\ndeveloped to encode classic works so the polytonic diacritics are more\nfitting. In other words, the oxe\u00eea will be used rather than t\u00f3nos. The\noxe\u00eea form can be converted to the modern accent form easily either\nthrough search and replace, or unicode normalization since oxe\u00eea has\ncanonical decomposition into t\u00f3nos.\n\nConversion can also be made more strict by using the ``strict`` flag.\n\n::\n\n    beta_to_uni(text, strict=False)\n\nIf set, only the cannonical order of diacritics is accepted in betacode.\nIf it is not set, then any order is allowed as long as capital letters\nbegin with a ``*`` and lowercase letters begin with the letter and not a\ndiacritic.\n\nUnicode to betacode\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n::\n\n    import betacode.conv\n\n    uni = '\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u1fbd \u1f15\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd'\n    betacode.conv.uni_to_beta(uni) # analabo/ntes de\\ kaq\\' e(/kaston\n\nThe unicode text can use polytonic (oxe\u00eea) accent marks or monotonic\n(t\u00f3nos) accent marks can be used.\n\nSpeed\n~~~~~\n\nThe original implementation used a custom made trie. This maybe was not\nthe fastest (I wasn't sure). So, I compared against a third party trie\nimplementation, pygtrie. The pygtrie had nicer prefix methods which\nallowed for much faster processing of large texts. This changed\nconverting all of Strabo or Herodotus in the Perseus catalog from a many\nminute operation to a ~3-4 second operation. I have seen implementations\nthat use regular expressions which I suspsect might be faster since the\nunderlying implementation is in C. However, this package is much smaller\nand simpler if betacode conversion is all that is needed than CLTK, for\nexample.\n\nModified Betacode\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThere is talk of a modified betacode that I have seen around on the\ninternet. I have never been able to find a definitive definition of this\nso I have not implemented it. Among some differences is word final sigma\nusage, ``_`` as macron, and uppercase and lowercase roman letters\ninstead of using ``*``.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nI am no classicist, and this was done in my free time. It is very\npossible that there are some letters missing that are not accounted for,\nor some punctuation that is not properly handled. If that is the case,\nplease tell me as it is easy to fix, or please open a PR for your own\nbranch. Write tests if you do add a feature.\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/matgrioni/betacode.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/matgrioni/betacode\n.. |Coverage Status| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/matgrioni/betacode/badge.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/matgrioni/betacode?branch=master", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/matgrioni/betacode", "keywords": "encoding,unicode,betacode,greek", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "betacode", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/betacode/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/betacode/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/matgrioni/betacode"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/betacode/1.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Betacode to Unicode converter.", "version": "1.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p><a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/matgrioni/betacode\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Build Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/9dcd8d28bd6ade0508bc70b219257de9357b63c2/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f6d61746772696f6e692f62657461636f64652e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a> <a href=\"https://coveralls.io/github/matgrioni/betacode?branch=master\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Coverage Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/9e37090e5a4398c7b4ce6795da2e6293e7a0d9b6/68747470733a2f2f636f766572616c6c732e696f2f7265706f732f6769746875622f6d61746772696f6e692f62657461636f64652f62616467652e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a></p>\n<div id=\"betacode\">\n<h2>betacode</h2>\n<p>Convert betacode to unicode and vice-versa easily.

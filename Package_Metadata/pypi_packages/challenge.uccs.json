this will be in the required format.\n\n  ``--which-set``: The set, for which the baseline detector should be run; possible values: ``training, validation, test, sample``; default: ``validation``.\n\n  ``--verbose``: Increase the verbosity of the script; using ``--verbose --verbose`` or ``-vv`` is recommended; ``-vvv`` will write more information.\n\n  ``--debug``: Run only over the specified number of images; for debug purposes only.\n\n  ``--display``: Display the detected bounding boxes (green) and the ground truth (red); for debug purposes only.\n\n  ``--parallel``: Run in the given number of parallel processes; can speed up the processing tremendously.\n\n  ``--gpus``: Run the face detection using Caffe_ in GPU mode (this might not work depending on your setup of Caffe_); you can specify the device ids to use, typically only `0`; if not specified, runs in CPU mode\n\nOn a machine with 32 CPU cores, a good command line for the full baseline experiment would be:\n\n  ``./bin/baseline_detector.py --data-directory YOUR-DATA-DIRECTORY -vv --parallel 32``\n\nOn a machine with 32 cores and two NVidia GPUs, a good command line for the full baseline experiment would be:\n\n  ``./bin/baseline_detector.py --data-directory YOUR-DATA-DIRECTORY -vv --parallel 8 --gpus 0 1``\n\nTo run a small-scale experiment, i.e., to display the detected faces on 20 images, a good command line might be:\n\n  ``./bin/baseline_detector.py --data-directory YOUR-DATA-DIRECTORY -vvv --display --debug 20``\n\n.. note::\n   The ``--display`` option requires Matplotlib_ to be installed and set up properly.\n   Display does not work in parallel mode.\n\nBy default, the face detection score file will be written to ``./results/UCCS-v2-detection-baseline-validation.txt``.\n\nFace Recognition\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFor face recognition, we utilize the `MTCNN v2`_ face detector to detect all the faces (see above) and make sure that the bounding boxes with the highest overlap to the ground truth labels are used.\nFor each of the detected bounding boxes in the training set, we enlarge the bounding box with a factor of 1.3 and extract features using the ``pool5/7x7_s1`` layer of the `VGG v2`_ recognition module, which we normalize to unit Euclidean length.\nThe template enrollment stage simply computes the average of the training set features for each of the known subjects.\nTo account for the fact that we have unknown subjects in the training and test set, we also enroll one gallery template including all known unknown subjects labeled as ``-1``.\n\nFor a probe image, we assume that we do not have any labels (this is what the test set will look like).\nHence, we run the `MTCNN v2`_ detector to detect faces (which will include several background regions).\nFor each bounding box, we extract the `VGG v2`_ feature as above, and compute **cosine similarities** to all gallery templates including the unknown template.\nThe highest 10 similarities are stored into the score file -- except when the unknown label (``-1``) is amongst the highest scores, in which case only the scores up to the ``-1`` label are stored.\nThis means that when the highest score is with the ``-1`` label, only one value is stored in the score file.\n\nYou can call the face recognition baseline script using:\n\n  ``./bin/baseline_recognizer.py``\n\nPlease refer to ``./bin/baseline_recognizer.py -h`` for possible options.\nHere is a subset of options that you might want/need to use/change:\n\n  ``--data-directory``: Specify the directory, where you have downloaded the UCCS dataset into\n\n  ``--result-file``: The file to write the recognition results into; this will be in the required format\n\n  ``--verbose``: Increase the verbosity of the script; using ``--verbose --verbose`` or ``-vv`` is recommended; ``-vvv`` will write more information\n\n  ``--temp-dir``: Specify the directory, where temporary files are stored; these files will be computed only once and reloaded if present\n\n  ``--force``: Ignore existing temporary files and always recompute everything\n\n  ``--debug``: Run only over the specified number of identities; for debug purposes only; will modify file names of temporary files and result file\n\n  ``--parallel``: Run in the given number of parallel processes; can speed up the processing tremendously\n\nOn a machine with 32 CPU cores, a good command line would be:\n\n  ``./bin/baseline_recognizer.py --data-directory YOUR-DATA-DIRECTORY -vv --parallel 32``\n\nWhen using Caffe_ in GPU mode with two NVidia GPUs, a good command line would be:\n\n  ``./bin/baseline_recognizer.py --data-directory YOUR-DATA-DIRECTORY -vv --parallel 2 --gpus 0 1``\n\nBy default, the face recognition score file will be written to ``./results/UCCS-v2-recognition-baseline-validation.txt``.\n\n\nEvaluation\n----------\n\nThe provided evaluation scripts will be usable to evaluate the validation set only, not the test set (since the test set labels are not given to the participants).\nYou can use the evaluation scripts for two purposes:\n\n1. To plot the baseline results in comparison to your results.\n2. To make sure that your score file is in the desired format.\n\nIf you are unable to run the baseline experiments on your machine, we provide the score files for the validation set on the `competition website`_.\n\n\nFace Detection Evaluation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAs the ground-truth is usually larger than the face, we do not punish bounding boxes that are smaller than the ground truth.\nTherefore, the union (the denominator) takes into account only one fourth of the ground truth bounding box -- or the intersection area, whichever is larger:\n\n.. math::\n   O(G,D) = \\frac{|G \\cap D|}{|G \\cup D|} = \\frac{G \\cap D}{\\max\\{\\frac{|G|}4, |G \\cap D|\\} + |D| - |G \\cap D|}\n\nwhere :math:`|\\cdot|` is the area operator.\nHence, when the detected bounding box :math:`D` covers at least a fourth of the ground-truth bounding box :math:`G` and is entirely contained inside :math:`G`, an overlap of 1 is reached.\n\nThe face detection is evaluated using the Free Receiver Operator Characteristic (FROC) curve, which plots the percentage of correctly detected faces over the total number of false alarms (detected background regions).\nDifferent points on the FROC curve can be obtained for different detector confidence values.\nThis plot can be created using:\n\n  ``./bin/evaluate_detector.py``\n\nThis script has several options, some of which need to be specified, see ``./bin/evaluate_detector.py -h``:\n\n  ``--data-directory``: Specify the directory, where you have downloaded the UCCS dataset into\n\n  ``--result-files``: A list of all files containing detection (or recognition) results\n\n  ``--labels``: A list of labels for the algorithms; must be the same number and in the same order as ``--result-files``\n\n  ``--froc-file``: The name of the output .pdf file containing the FROC plot; default is ``UCCS-v2-FROC.pdf``\n\n  ``--log-x``: will plot the horizontal axis in logarithmic scale\n\n  ``--only-present``: will ignore any file for which no detection exists (for debug purposes only, i.e., when detector ran with the ``--debug`` option)\n\n  ``--verbose``: Increase the verbosity of the script; using ``--verbose --verbose`` or ``-vv`` is recommended\n\nTo plot the baseline FROC curve (which is shown on the `competition website`_), execute:\n\n  ``./bin/evaluate_detector.py --data-directory YOUR-DATA-DIRECTORY --result-files results/UCCS-v2-detection-baseline-validation.txt --labels Baseline --log-x -vv``\n\n.. note::\n   If you have run the face recognition baseline, you can also use the face recognition result file for plotting the FROC curve:\n\n     ``./bin/evaluate_detector.py --data-directory YOUR-DATA-DIRECTORY --result-files results/UCCS-v2-recognition-baseline-validation.txt --labels Baseline --log-x -vv``\n\n\nFace Recognition Evaluation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOpen set face recognition is evaluated using the Detection and Identification Rate (DIR) curve, which plots the percentage of correctly detected and identified faces over the total number of false identifications.\nBased on various values of the false identifications, several score thresholds are computed.\nA face is said to be identified correctly if the recognition score is greater than the threshold and the correct identity has the highest recognition score for that face.\nThe number of correctly identified faces is computed, and divided by the total number of known faces.\nFor more details, please refer to [1]_.\n\n.. note::\n   By default only rank 1 recognition is performed, but the evaluation can be done using any rank up to 10 (the upper bound of allowed labels per face).\n   Providing more than one identity label per face will increase the number of false alarms, and may only have an impact on higher rank evaluations.\n\n.. note::\n   Unknown identities or background regions labeled with label -1 or not labeled at all will be ignored (i.e., will not decrease performance).\n   Labeling an unknown identity or a background region with any other label than -1 will result in a false alarm -- only the maximum score per bounding box will be considered.\n\nThe DIR plot can be created using:\n\n  ``./bin/evaluate_recognizer.py``\n\nAs usual, the script has several options, which are similar to ``./bin/evaluate_detector.py`` above, see ``./bin/evaluate_recognizer.py -h`` for a complete list:\n\n  ``--data-directory``: Specify the directory, where you have downloaded the UCCS dataset into\n\n  ``--result-files``: A list of all files containing recognition results\n\n  ``--labels``: A list of labels for the algorithms; must be the same number and in the same order as ``--result-files``\n\n  ``--dir-file``: The name of the output .pdf file containing the DIR plot; default is ``UCCS-v2-DIR.pdf``\n\n  ``--log-x``: will plot the horizontal axis in logarithmic scale\n\n  ``--only-present``: will ignore any file for which no detection exists (for debug purposes only, i.e., when recognizer ran with the ``--debug`` option)\n\n  ``--verbose``: Increase the verbosity of the script; using ``--verbose --verbose`` or ``-vv`` is recommended\n\n  ``--rank``: Use the given rank to plot the DIR curve\n\n\nTo plot the baseline Rank 1 DIR curve (which is shown on the `competition website`_), execute:\n\n  ``./bin/evaluate_recognizer.py --data-directory YOUR-DATA-DIRECTORY --result-files results/UCCS-v2-recognition-baseline-validation.txt --labels Baseline --log-x -vv``\n\n\nTrouble Shooting\n----------------\n\nIn case of trouble with running the baseline algorithm or the evaluation, please contact us via email under: opensetface@vast.uccs.edu\n\n\n.. _bob: http://www.idiap.ch/software/bob\n.. _oracle's virtualbox: https://www.virtualbox.org\n.. _matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org\n.. _buildout: http://www.buildout.org\n.. _competition website: http://vast.uccs.edu/Opensetface\n.. _caffe: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html\n.. _mtcnn v2: https://github.com/walkoncross/mtcnn-caffe-zyf\n.. _vgg v2: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face2\n\n..

using ``--verbose --verbose`` or ``-vv`` is recommended<br><br>  ``--rank``: Use the given rank to plot the DIR curve<br><br><br>To plot the baseline Rank 1 DIR curve (which is shown on the `competition website`_), execute:<br><br>  ``./bin/evaluate_recognizer.py --data-directory YOUR-DATA-DIRECTORY --result-files results/UCCS-v2-recognition-baseline-validation.txt --labels Baseline --log-x -vv``<br><br><br>Trouble Shooting<br>----------------<br><br>In case of trouble with running the baseline algorithm or the evaluation, please contact us via email under: opensetface@vast.uccs.edu<br><br><br>.. _bob: http://www.idiap.ch/software/bob<br>.. _oracle's virtualbox: https://www.virtualbox.org<br>.. _matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org<br>.. _buildout: http://www.buildout.org<br>.. _competition website: http://vast.uccs.edu/Opensetface<br>.. _caffe: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html<br>.. _mtcnn v2: https://github.com/walkoncross/mtcnn-caffe-zyf<br>.. _vgg v2: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face2<br><br>..

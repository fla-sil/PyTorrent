Our contributions to the science of injury causation and prevention aim to significantly reduce the U.S. warfighter's exposure to serious, severe, and fatal injuries.\n\nFor more information, see our [website](http://www.sandia.gov/biomechanics/).\n\n## Library [![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3610/) [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](https://github.com/sandialabs/sibl#license)\n\n* XYFigure\n  * [Getting started](https://github.com/sandialabs/sibl/blob/master/xyfigure/README.md)\n  * [Documentation](https://github.com/sandialabs/sibl/blob/master/xyfigure/documentation.md)\n  * [Test Cases](https://github.com/sandialabs/sibl/blob/master/xyfigure/test/README.md)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Python 3.6 or higher (the library requires f-strings)\n* Scipy\n* Pillow\n\n```console\n$ python3 -m pip install Pillow\n```\n\n## Workflow Choice\n\nThere are two workflows: (1) Client,  (2) Developer\n\n| **Client** | **Developer**  |\n|---|---|\n| *\"I just want to use the library, I don't want to develop the library.\"* | *\"I want to use the library and develop the library.\"* | \n| [Client Directions](https://github.com/sandialabs/sibl/blob/master/README.md#client-workflow---choice-12) | [Developer Directions](https://github.com/sandialabs/sibl/blob/master/README.md#developer-workflow---choice-22) | \n\n## Client Workflow - Choice 1/2\n\nInstall [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), \nthen read [these directions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/) for \ncontext.  Next, from a terminal, install\n\n```bash\n$ pip install xyfigure\n```\n\nIf your computer does not have a network connection, install the WHL file (a Python\npackage saved in Wheel format), which must can be obtained from Chad directly, or \nfrom [here](https://pypi.org/project/sibllib/#files).   Then\n\n```bash\n$ pip install --user xyfigure-0.0.3-py3-non-any.whl\n```\n\nVerify installation: check that **xyfigure** is contained in the list generated by \n\n```bash\n$ pip list\n```\n\n## Developer Workflow - Choice 2/2\n\nFor an overview, [read the guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) from GitHub.\n\n### Get a local copy of the repository using `git clone` with SSH\n\n```console\n$ cd ~  # Starting from the home directory is optional, but recommended.\n$ git clone git@github.com:sandialabs/sibl.git\n```\n\n### Push to the repository\n\nIf you update the codebase, and wish to have the modifications merged into the main repository, you will need to either *push to the repository* if you are a collaborator (information below), or *create a pull request* if you have forked the repo (information to come).\n\nIn the `~/sibl/.git/config` file, add the following:\n\n```python\n[user]\n    name = James Bond  # your first and last name\n    email = jb007@company.com  # your email address\n```\n\nConfigure ssh keys between your local and the repo.  This assumes to you have an existing public key file in `~/.ssh/id_rsa/id_rsa.pub`.  See [this](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) to create a public key.  See [this](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github) for troubleshooting.\n\nCopy the entire **public** key to the GitHub site under [Settings > SSH and GPG keys](https://github.com/settings/keys).\n\nFrom within the repo `~/sibl/`, set the username and email on a *per-repo* basis:\n\n```console\n$ git config user.name \"James Bond\"  # your first and last name in quotations\n$ git config user.email \"jb007@company.com\"  # your email address in quotations\n```\n\n## Contact\n\n* Chad B.

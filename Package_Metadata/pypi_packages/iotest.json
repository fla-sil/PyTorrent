The filename stem (the part before dot/extension) indicates the name of the test case. This is then used to find a test executable with the matching stem. For example, if we have a test case file `thing.iot` and corresponding executable file `thing.py`, iotest will run `thing.py` and compare its output to the expectations specified in `thing.iot`. If there is more than one test case file, e.g. `thing.iot` and `thing.err`, then they will be combined together as long as they do not conflict (in other words, `thing.iot` cannot also specify a stderr expectation).\n\n\n# Issues\n\nPlease file issues to the github repository: github.com/gwk/iotest.\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/gwk/iotest", "keywords": "testing", "license": "CC0", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "iotest", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/iotest/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/iotest/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/gwk/iotest"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/iotest/0.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "iotest is a small tool for testing programs based on input and output.", "version": "0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>writeup v0\nDedicated to the public domain under CC0: <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/</a>.</p>\n<p># iotest</p>\n<p>iotest is a small tool for testing command line programs.

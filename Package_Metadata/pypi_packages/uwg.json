Specifically, it morphs rural [EnergyPlus weather (.epw) files](http://www.ladybug.tools/epwmap/) to reflect average conditions within the urban canyon using a range of properties including:\n\n* Building geometry (including building height, ground coverage, window:wall area, and facade:site area)\n* Building use (including program type, HVAC systems, and occupancy/equipment scheduling)\n* Cooling system heat rejection to the outdoors (for Summer)\n* Indoor heat leakage to the outdoors (for Winter)\n* Urban materials (including the thermal mass, albedo and emissivity of roads, walls, and roofs)\n* Anthropogenic heat from traffic (including traffic schedules)\n* Vegetation coverage (both trees and shrubs)\n* Atmospheric heat transfer from urban boundary and canopy layers\n\nThe [original Urban Weather Generator](http://urbanmicroclimate.scripts.mit.edu/uwg.php) was developed by Bruno Bueno for [his PhD thesis at MIT](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/59107).  Since this time, it has been validated 3 times and has been [enhanced by Aiko Nakano](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/108779).  In 2016, Joseph Yang also [improved the engine and added a range of building templates](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/107347).\n\nThis repository is a Python translation of the original [MATLAB Urban Weather Generator](https://github.com/hansukyang/UWG_Matlab).\n\n# Example\nHere is a Python example that shows how to create and run an Urban Weather Generator object. The example script is available [at resources/uwg_example.py](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/uwg/blob/master/resources/uwg_example.py). Run it through your command prompt in the main uwg directory with the following: ```python -m resources.uwg_example```\n\n```python\nfrom uwg import uwg\n\n# Define the .epw, .uwg filenames to create an uwg object.\n# uwg will look for the .epw file in the uwg/resources/epw folder,\n# and the .uwg file in the uwg/resources/parameters folder.\nepw_filename = \"SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.epw\"      # .epw file name\nparam_filename = \"initialize_singapore.uwg\"         # .uwg file name\n\n# Initialize the UWG object and run the simulation\nuwg_ = uwg(epw_filename, param_filename)\nuwg_.run()\n```\n\nHere is the sample .uwg file used in the simulation above. The .uwg file is a a required input where the local building, urban, and geographic features are defined. These features are then used in the simulation to morph the .epw file. This file is available [at resources/initialize_singapore.uwg](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/uwg/blob/master/resources/initialize_singapore.uwg).\n\n```\n# =================================================\n# REQUIRED PARAMETERS\n# =================================================\n\n# Urban characteristics\nbldHeight,10,     # average building height (m)\nbldDensity,0.5,   # urban area building plan density (0-1)\nverToHor,0.8,     # urban area vertical to horizontal ratio\nh_mix,1,           # fraction of building HVAC waste heat set to the street canyon [as opposed to the roof]\ncharLength,1000,  # dimension of a square that encompasses the whole neighborhood [aka. characteristic length] (m)\nalbRoad,0.1,      # road albedo (0 - 1)\ndRoad,0.5,        # road pavement thickness (m)\nkRoad,1,          # road pavement conductivity (W/m K)\ncRoad,1600000,    # road volumetric heat capacity (J/m^3 K)\nsensAnth,20,      # non-building sensible heat at street level [aka. heat from cars, pedestrians, street cooking, etc. ] (W/m^2)\nlatAnth,2,        # non-building latent heat (W/m^2) (currently not used)\n\n# Climate Zone (Eg.

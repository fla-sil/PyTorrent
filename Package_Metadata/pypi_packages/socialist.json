It uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.\n\nAttacks happen in one or more steps. A perpetrator first investigates the intended victim to gather necessary background information, such as potential points of entry and weak security protocols, needed to proceed with the attack. Then, the attacker moves to gain the victim\u2019s trust and provide stimuli for subsequent actions that break security practices, such as revealing sensitive information or granting access to critical resources. What makes social engineering especially dangerous is that it relies on human error, rather than vulnerabilities in software and operating systems. Mistakes made by legitimate users are much less predictable, making them harder to identify and thwart than a malware-based intrusion.\n\nFor more information about social engineering attacks check [social engineering attacks].\n\nRequirements\n-------------------\n  - python 3\n  - tqdm\n  - phonenumbers\n  - validate_email\n  - py3dns\n  \nInstallation\n-------------\n\n**Linux**\n\n ```\n apt-get install python3-pip\n git clone https://github.com/OverwatchHeir/SociaList.git\n cd SociaList\n python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n ```\n \n**MacOS**\n ```\n brew install python3\n brew install pip\n git clone https://github.com/OverwatchHeir/SociaList.git\n cd SociaList\n python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n ```\n **Windows**\n \n Download python 3 and pip from [python webpage] and then: \n ```\n git clone https://github.com/OverwatchHeir/SociaList.git\n cd SociaList\n python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n ```\n **Alternative**\n \n Using the traditional installation from **pip** or **easy_install**\n ```\n easy_install3 -U pip # you have to install python3-setuptools , update pip\n pip3 install tqdm\n pip3 install phonenumbers\n pip3 install validate_email\n pip3 install py3dns\n pip3 install socialist\n socialist # installed successfully\n ```\nUsage\n---------\n\n**Run**\n\n```$ python3 socialist.py [-h] -o OUTPUT [-c COMBINATIONS]```\n\nAt the beginning of the execution of this script, you will be asked for a series of personal information about which you intend to create the list of passwords.

It fetches all stories from the given project board, detects which ones were pokered (they received labels with numbers in a certain time frame), detects which ones were repokered, detects what pull-requests relate to them, and detects pull-requests of that week. Finally it outputs an markdown-formatted text for copy-pasting. It takes around 20 seconds to generate a report.\n\n## Installation\n\nUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install ghsprint.\n\n```bash\npip install ghsprint\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\npython -m ghsprint --special-tags \"on hold\" --ignore-columns \"Product Backlog\" --login-name-mapper alxndrjhn:Alex,strenge:Robin --keep-columns \"In Progress\" ae71abf4f9a41cbb6af0005de932e265614f6a317c7 Storyboard company/some-service company/someLabel company/some_extraction\n```\n\n### Arguments\n`access-token` is a [personal access-token from GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens), `ghsprint` requires only access to 'repo'\n\n`project-name` is the project number, this will be fetched at stories are detected for the sprint. At the moment the number is only accessible through the [Github API Projects endpoint](https://developer.github.com/v3/projects/#list-repository-projects)\n\n`repos` is space-separated list of owner/repository pairs, all pull-requests from this repositories will be considered for the sprint report. Example: `myownName/myRepo someOrganization/some_service`.\n\n### Optional parameters\n`--keep-columns`\nlist of columns names to have in the report when fetching stories from the project board, separated by commas. Example `--keep-columns \"In Process\"`\n\n`--login-name-mapper TEXT`\nlist of mappings in the format `login_name:name_to_display,...`, to have better names in the report\n\n`--special-tags TEXT`\nlist of special tags in the format `tag1,tag2,...`, this tags are mentioned if they are attached to a story or pull request. Example `--special-tags \"on hold\"`\n\n`--ignore-columns`\nlist of columns names to ignore when fetching stories from the project board, separated by commas. Example `--ignore-columns \"Product Backlog,Some other column\"`\n\n`-v` verbosity level, if not given, only the report and errors will be printed to stdout, with `-v` warnings will be printed as well, with `-vv` info messages and with `-vvv` debug messages\n\n`-w` or `--week` is the calender week-number, if not given, the current week will be used. Example: `--week 6` will generate the report for the 6th week of the current year.\n\n## Output\n```\n# title\n\n19. June - 25.

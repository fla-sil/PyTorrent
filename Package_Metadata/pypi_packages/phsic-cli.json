between two objects utilizing *similarities*.\n\nFor example, given consistent sentence pairs:\n\n| X                                                            | Y                  |\n|

https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fasttext-vectors/crawl-300d-2M.vec.zip\n$ unzip crawl-300d-2M.vec.zip\n```\n\nPrepare dataset:\n\n```\n$ TAB=\"$(printf '\\t')\"\n$ cat << EOF > train.txt\nThey had

Built using the `Django`_ framework, YaCms provides a\nsimple yet highly extensible architecture that encourages diving in\nand hacking on the code. YaCms is `BSD licensed`_ and supported by\na diverse and active community.\n\nIn some ways, YaCms resembles tools such as `Wordpress`_,\nproviding an intuitive interface for managing pages, blog posts, form\ndata, store products, and other types of content. But YaCms is\nalso different. Unlike many other platforms that make extensive use of\nmodules or reusable applications, YaCms provides most of its\nfunctionality by default. This approach yields a more integrated and\nefficient platform.\n\nVisit the `YaCms project page`_ to see some of the `great sites\npeople have built using YaCms`_.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\nIn addition to the usual features provided by Django such as MVC\narchitecture, ORM, templating, caching and an automatic admin\ninterface, YaCms provides the following:\n\n* Hierarchical page navigation\n* Save as draft and preview on site\n* Scheduled publishing\n* Drag-and-drop page ordering\n* WYSIWYG editing\n* `In-line page editing`_\n* Drag-and-drop HTML5 forms builder with CSV export\n* SEO friendly URLs and meta data\n* Ecommerce / Shopping cart module (`Cartridge`_)\n* Configurable `dashboard`_ widgets\n* Blog engine\n* Tagging\n* `Free Themes`_, and a `Premium Themes`_ Marketplace\n* User accounts and profiles with email verification\n* Translated to over 35 languages\n* Sharing via Facebook or Twitter\n* `Multi-lingual sites`_\n* `Custom templates`_ per page or blog post\n* `Twitter Bootstrap`_ integration\n* API for `custom content types`_\n* `Search engine and API`_\n* Seamless integration with third-party Django apps\n* Multi-device detection and template handling\n* One step migration from other blogging engines\n* Automated production provisioning and deployments\n* `Disqus`_ integration, or built-in threaded comments\n* `Gravatar`_ integration\n* `Google Analytics`_ integration\n* `Twitter`_ feed integration\n* `bit.ly`_ integration\n* `Akismet`_ spam filtering\n* Built-in `test suite`_\n* `JVM`_ compatible (via `Jython`_)\n\nThe YaCms admin dashboard:\n\n.. image:: http://yacms.vn/docs/_images/dashboard.png\n\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nTo **report a security issue**, please send an email privately to\n`core-team@yacms.vn`_. This gives us a chance to fix the issue\nand create an official release prior to the issue being made public.\n\nFor **all other YaCms support**, the primary channel is the\n`YaCms-users`_ mailing list. Questions, comments, issues, feature\nrequests, and all other related discussions should take place here.\n\nIf you're **certain** you've come across a bug, then please use the\n`GitHub issue tracker`_, however it's crucial that enough information\nis provided to reproduce the bug, ideally with a small code sample repo\nwe can simply fork, run, and see the issue with. Other useful\ninformation includes things such as the Python stack trace generated by\nerror pages, as well as other aspects of the development environment\nused, such as operating system, database, and Python version. If\n**you're not sure you've found a reproducible bug**, then please try\nthe mailing list first.\n\nFinally, feel free to drop by the `#YaCms IRC channel`_ on\n`Freenode`_, for a chat! Lastly, communications in all YaCms spaces\nare expected to conform to the `Django Code of Conduct`_.\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nYaCms is an open source project managed using both the Git and\nMercurial version control systems. These repositories are hosted on\nboth `GitHub`_ and `Bitbucket`_ respectively, so contributing is as\neasy as forking the project on either of these sites and committing\nback your enhancements.\n\nPlease note the following guidelines for contributing:\n\n* If you're fairly confident you've identified a bug or have already written a\n  patch, feel free to open an issue or pull request. Otherwise, please discuss\n  on the `YaCms-users`_ mailing list first.\n* Contributed code must be written in the existing style. For Python\n  (and to a decent extent, JavaScript as well), this is as simple as\n  following the `Django coding style`_ and (most importantly)\n  `PEP 8`_. Front-end CSS should adhere to the\n  `Bootstrap CSS guidelines`_.\n* Contributions must be available on a separately named branch\n  based on the latest version of the main branch.\n* Run the tests before committing your changes. If your changes\n  cause the tests to break, they won't be accepted.\n* If you are adding new functionality, you must include basic tests\n  and documentation.\n\n\nDonating\n========\n\nIf you would like to make a donation to continue development of\nYaCms, you can do so via the `YaCms Project`_ website.\n\n\nQuotes\n======", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/minhhoit/yacms/tarball/1.0", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/minhhoit/yacms", "keywords": null, "license": "BSD", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "YaCms", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/YaCms/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/YaCms/", "project_urls": {"Download": "https://github.com/minhhoit/yacms/tarball/1.0", "Homepage": "https://github.com/minhhoit/yacms"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/YaCms/4.2.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "An open source content management platform built using the Django framework.", "version": "4.2.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            .. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/minhhoit/yacms.png?branch=master<br>   :target: http://travis-ci.org/minhhoit/yacms<br><br>Created by `Andrew &lt;http://twitter.com/minhhoit&gt;`_<br><br>========<br>Overview<br>========<br><br>YaCms is a powerful, consistent, and flexible content management<br>platform.

The **Mutual Information** (MI) between stimulus and response (Miller and Nicely, 1955),\n        sometimes called \"transmitted information\".\n        This measure indicates the average amount of information about the stimulus category,\n        received by the listener by hearing each presented phoneme.\n\n1. **Detailed performance** is shown by *credible confusion pattern*, i.e., a set of\n    stimulus-response pairs where listeners' response probabilities are\n    jointly credibly different between test conditions.\n\nThe Bayesian model is hierarchical.\nThe package estimates predictive distributions of results for\n* a random individual in the population from which participants were recruited,\n* each individual in the group of test participants.\n\n## Phoneme Identification Experiments\nThe package can analyze data from simple or rather complex experimental designs,\nincluding the following features:\n\n1. Phoneme identification data may be collected in one or more **Test Conditions**.\n    Each test condition may be a combination of categories from several *Test Factors*.\n    For example, the main test factor may be *Hearing Aid*,\n    with categories *A*, *B*, or *Unaided*.\n    Another test factor may be, e.g.,\n    *Background*, with categories *Quiet*, or *Noisy*.\n    A third factor may be *Position*, with categories *C1* or *C2*, indicating\n    the consonant position in CVC nonsense words.\n    The analysis shows *credible differences* between categories within the first (main) test factor,\n    for each combination of categories in other (secondary) test factors.\n\n1. One or more **Listener Groups** may be included.\n    The analysis shows *credible differences* between groups.\n\n1. The analysis model does not require anything about the number of\n    test presentations for each phoneme category.\n    The validation (Leijon et al., 2016) showed that reliable results\n    could be derived with as few as five presentations per phoneme.\n    The analysis estimates the **statistical credibility**\n    of all results, given the limited amount of collected data.\n\n## Package Documentation\nGeneral information is given in the package doc-string that may be accessed by command\n`help(ConfMatrixCalc)`.\n\nSpecific information about the organization and accepted formats of input data files\nis presented in the doc-string of module cm_data, accessible via `help(ConfMatrixCalc.cm_data)`.\nThe current version can read data from Excel workbook files or from `json`-serialized\ntext files with a special format.\n\nAfter running an analysis, the logging output briefly explains\nthe analysis results presented in figures and tables.\n\n## Usage\n1. Install the most recent package version:\n    `python3 -m pip install --upgrade ConfMatrixCalc`\n\n1. Copy the template script `run_cm.py` to your work directory, rename it,\n    and edit the copy as guided by comments in the template, to specify\n    - your experimental layout,\n    - the top input data directory,\n    - a directory where all output result files will be stored.\n\n1. Run your edited script: `python3 run_my_cm.py`.\n\n## Requirements\nThis package requires Python 3.6 or later with Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib,\nas well as a support package samppy,\nand the Openpyxl package for reading data from Excel workbook documents.\nThe pip installer will check and install the required packages if needed.\n\nHowever, it does *not* check the version of those packages if already installed.\nIn case of some error, try upgrading the required packages manually, e.g., as\n `python3 -m pip install --upgrade matplotlib`\n\n## References\nA.

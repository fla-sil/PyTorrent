However, by the time the experiment has finished you don't know what changes you were testing (presumably because you made more changes in the meanwhile).\n  * You need a distributed way of collecting all the experiments (parameters and results), making sure that they have been run on the exact same version of the code.\n\nUsage\n-----\nCreate an `ExperimentLogger` object, passing the parameters of the experiment. When the experiment is finished, call\nthe `record_results()` method of that object, ie:\n\n```python\nwith ExperimentLogger(name=\"NameOfExperiment\", parameters=parameters_dict) as experiment_logger:\n    ...\n    experiment_logger.record_results(dict_of_results)\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, a git tag will be created (committing any changes you may have in the working tree, into a different branch). The tag will have a name of the form `exp_NameOfExperiment_timestamp` and in the message it will have a JSON representation of the parameters and the results (when/if recorded). The working state of the current branch will seemingly remain unaffected. Note that this is *not* thread-safe.\n\nIf no result is recorded (ie `record_results` is not called) within the `with` then the experiment will be deleted upon exit from that block. This is useful when stopping experiments or when experiments fail before finishing.\n\nThere is a command-line tool that helps with retrieving tests. In the git folder, run the command\n```\n> experimenter -c SHAofCodeState\n```\nto retrieve all the experiments that happened with the give code version. If `-c` is not provided then all experiments will be shown. If `-s` is provided only experiments that have results will be shown. The strict command is off by default.

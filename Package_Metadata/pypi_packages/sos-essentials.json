To bridge the\ngap between interactive analysis and workflow systems, we developed Script\nof Scripts (SoS), a system with strong emphases on readability, practicality,\nand reproducibility for daily computational research. For exploratory analysis\nSoS provides a multi-language file format and scripting engine that centralizes\nall computations, and creates dynamic report documents for publishing and\nsharing.

Since the library is written\r\nin python, it allows for easy scripting and/or integration into their existing\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\nContinuing, most monitoring software needs to be stress tested against\r\nhundreds or even thousands of devices (why this was originally written), but\r\ngetting access to that many is unwieldy at best. The pymodbus3 server will allow\r\na user to test as many devices as their base operating system will allow (*allow*\r\nin this case means how many Virtual IP addresses are allowed).\r\n\r\nFor more information please browse the\r\n`project documentation <http://readthedocs.org/docs/pymodbus3/en/latest/index.html>`_.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------\r\nExample Code\r\n------------\r\n\r\nFor those of you that just want to get started fast, here you go::\r\n\r\n    from pymodbus3.client.sync import ModbusTcpClient\r\n    \r\n    client = ModbusTcpClient('127.0.0.1')\r\n    client.write_coil(1, True)\r\n    result = client.read_coils(1,1)\r\n    print result.bits[0]\r\n    client.close()\r\n\r\nFor more advanced examples, check out the examples included in the\r\nrepository.

It should be noted that without twisted,\r\none will only be able to run the synchronized version as the\r\nasynchronous versions uses twisted for its event loop.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nCurrent Work In Progress\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nListing of immediate tasks:\r\n\r\n  * Fixing bugs/feature requests\r\n  * Architecture documentation\r\n  * Functional testing against any reference I can find\r\n  * The remaining edges of the protocol (that I think no one uses)\r\n   \r\n-------------------\r\nLicense Information\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nPymodbus is built on top of code developed from/by:\r\n  * Copyright (c) 2001-2005 S.W.A.C.

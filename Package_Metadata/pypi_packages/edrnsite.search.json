(There is no corresponding issue in the issue tracker\nfor this new feature; or if there is, the issue tracker is down as I write\nthis and can't confirm.)\n\n\n1.0.0 - Prime Time\n------------------\n\nThis release addresses a number of issues that make this component (and some\nof its selected counterparts) \"prime time\" for the operational NCI portal.\n\nThis release addresses the following issues:\n\nYou can find the issue tracker at https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA\n\n\n0.0.2 - Specimen Search - 2010-08-09\n------------------------------------\n\nThis release added free-text search that matched ERNE specimens provided by\nthe ``eke.specimens`` package.\n\n\n0.0.1 - Undocumented Release\n----------------------------\n\nThe changelog failed to be updated for this release.\n\n\n0.0.0 - Unreleased\n------------------\n\nInitial release into beta.\n\n\nCopyright\n=========\n\nCopyright 2009-2010 by the California Institute of Technology.

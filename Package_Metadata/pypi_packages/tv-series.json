You will be asked for an API key which you can generate on [thetvdb.com](https://www.thetvdb.com/).\n\n```\n$ tv init\n```\n\nTo add your first series, first use `search` to find your series by its name.\n\n```\n$ tv search dexter\n79349: Dexter (Ended)\n  Dexter Morgan is a Miami-based blood splatter expert who doesn't just solve murders; he commits them too. In fact, he's a serial killer -- but he only murders the guilty, so he feels justified with his lifestyle choices. His policewoman sister and his cop co-workers have no idea Dexter lives a double life; however, adoptive father Harry knows his secret, and does, in fact, help Dexter hone his \"skills.\" It's a unique brand of justice for which charming Dexter feels a psychological hunger.\n\n356343: Dexter: Early Cuts (Ended)\n  Animated web series providing background and depth to Dexter's character and relationships.\n```\n\nUse the numeric ID to `add` the series you were looking for.\n\n```\n$ tv add 79349\nLooking up series by id 79349\nAdded series Dexter with default category default\n```\n\nNow you can see your series using `list`. It shows that there are 96 episodes available to watch.\n\n```\n$ tv list -c default\n  TVDB ID  Series    Last seen    Available          Next on air    Status\n---------  --------  -----------  -----------------  -------------  --------\n    79349  Dexter                 S01E01 (96 total)  -              Ended\n```\n\nLet's show a different example. Below, you can see that:\n\n* You've seen the first season of The Orville, but there is one more season available with 14 episodes\n* You've seen all of Fool Us, but the next episode will be available June 24th\n* You've finished The Wire and there will be no more episodes\n\n```\n$ tv list -a\n  TVDB ID  Series                   Last seen    Available            Next on air          Status\n---------  -----------------------  -----------  -------------------  -------------------  ----------\n   328487  The Orville              S01E12       S02E01 (14 total)    -                    Continuing\n   239851  Penn & Teller: Fool Us   S06E01       -                    S06E02 (2019-06-24)  Continuing\n    79126  The Wire                 S05E10       -                    -                    Ended\n```\n\nTo read more about the available features, try `tv --help`.\n\n### Data and configuration\n\nData and configuration is stored according to the [XDG base dir spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html), i.e., in `$XDG_DATA_HOME` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, respectively.\n\n## Development\n\nYou need Python 3 to work on this project. To install the package and development tools, run:\n\n```\n$ pip install -e \".[dev]\"\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nThere is currently no test suite. One will likely be added if the codebase grows large or complex enough.\n\n### Code style\n\nThe codebase must adhere to the rules of the following formatter rules:\n\n* [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n* [flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8)\n* [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort)\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://gitlab.com/kvikshaug/tv", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "tv-series", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/tv-series/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/tv-series/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://gitlab.com/kvikshaug/tv"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/tv-series/1.0.0/", "requires_dist": ["click", "requests", "tabulate", "xdg", "black ; extra == 'dev'", "flake8 ; extra == 'dev'", "flake8-bugbear ; extra == 'dev'", "isort ; extra == 'dev'"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "", "version": "1.0.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>tv</h1>\n<p>tv is a lightweight CLI application that helps you manage your favorite TV series.</p>\n<p>By utilizing the exhaustive TV series database at <a href=\"https://www.thetvdb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">thetvdb.com</a>, the client lets you manage and categorize a list of your favorite tv series, keep track of which episodes you've seen, and see when the next episode is airing.</p>\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n<p>Install the package from pypi:</p>\n<pre><code>$ pip install tv-series\n</code></pre>\n<p>Run <code>init</code> to initialize the application.

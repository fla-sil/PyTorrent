All the configuration options are\n        commented. By default, ``taskreport`` tries to look at ``~/.taskreport`` for\n        the configuration file. You can specify another location by using the ``-c``\n        command-line option.\n        \n        The configuration file contains: \n        \n        * a ``SMTP`` section for the SMTP credentials of the account to be used to send\n          the report email\n        * a ``MAIL`` section to define the email subject and recipient(s)\n        * one section for each section to be included in the report: the section name\n          in the configuration file will become the section title in the generated HTML.\n          The section should only contain one ``filter`` option which should follow\n          Taskwarrior's filtering syntax: this option will be fed directly to Taskwarrior\n          to generate the list of tasks to include in the report.\n        * each section can also (optionally) include an ``order`` option to specify how\n          the tasks should be ordered within a section. This option consists in\n          a space-separated list of keys, each key followed by a plus or a minus sign.\n          This indicates by order of precedence the key by which the tasks should be\n          ordered. The plus or the minus sign indicates if the order for the key it is\n          attached to should be increasing or decreasing. For example, ``priority-\n          due-`` means that the tasks should be ordered by decreasing ``priority``, and\n          in cases of ties by decreasing due date.\n        \n        Command-line options\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        \n        The available command line options and their meaning can be found by typing\n        ``taskreport -h``. Certain options can be defined both in the configuration\n        file and on the command-line. For those options, the command-line has\n        precedence over the configuration file.\n        \n        Template\n        ~~~~~~~~\n        \n        Using a template is optional: Taskreport has a basic default layout. If you\n        wish to customize the layout, you can specify the location of a template file\n        by using the ``-t`` option on the command line.\n        \n        The template file will be rendered by the Jinja template engine and thus must\n        comply to Jinja's syntax. You should refer to `Jinja's official documentation\n        <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/>`__ for more details.\n        \n        The template file will receive as an environment variable a ``section_list``\n        variable. This is a list of dictionaries, one for each section. A section's\n        dictionary contains two keys: ``title`` for the section title, and\n        ``task_list`` which is a JSON object containing the output you would get by\n        using Taskwarrior's export command with this section's filter rule.\n        \n        A sample template file located at ``share/email_template.html`` should have\n        been distributed with this package. A more advanced template\n        ``share/showcase_template.html`` is also included to showcase a more complex\n        scenario. The output produced by this template on a sample set of tasks can be\n        seen at ``share/showcase.html``.\n        \n        Bugs, comments\n        --------------\n        \n        This tool, although simple, might contain bugs or might be missing important\n        features.

It focuses primarily on facilitating consuming our most popular APIs and services, currently including BIG-IP (via Automation Tool Chain) and F5 Cloud Services. \n\nSimilar to other popular cloud shells (for example, AWS CLI, Azure CLI, and Google gcloud), it is built on a python client library. For those looking to write custom automation scripts or workloads, one may choose to leverage the same python library it is built on (https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-sdk-python).  \n\nThe F5 CLI is currently in early development and we want to hear from you! To provide feedback on CLI or this documentation, you can file a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/F5Devcentral/f5-cli/issues).\n\nBenefits: \n\n- Quickly access and consume F5\u2019s APIs and Services with familiar remote CLI UX\n- Configurable settings \n- Include common actions in Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines \n- Prototyping  \n    - Test calls that may be used in more complex custom integrations using the underlying SDK\n    - Supports discovery activities/querying of command-line results (for example, \u201clist accounts\u201d to find the desired account which will be used as an input to final automation) \n- Support quick one-off automation activities (for example, leveraging a bash loop to create/delete large lists of objects)   \n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n- [User Documentation](#user-documentation)\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Install F5 CLI with pip\n```bash\npip install f5-cli\nf5 --help\n```\n\n### Run F5 CLI in Docker container\n\n#### Example: Run the F5 CLI with docker container interactively \n```bash\ndocker run -it -v \"$HOME/.f5_cli:/root/.f5_cli\" -v \"$(pwd):/f5-cli\" f5devcentral/f5-cli:latest /bin/bash\n```\n#### Example: Run the F5 CLI with docker container using an alias\n```bash\nalias f5='docker run -it -v \"$HOME/.f5_cli:/root/.f5_cli\" -v \"$(pwd):/f5-cli\" f5devcentral/f5-cli:latest f5'\n```\n#### Example: Run the F5 CLI with docker container from path\n\nAnother shortcut to launch f5-cli is to assign a file containing the following content in your system's PATH (ex. cat /usr/local/bin/f5). This example also set environment variable to set the log level and disable ssl warnings of the application.\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin bash\ndocker run -it --rm -e \"F5_SDK_LOG_LEVEL=INFO\" -e \"F5_DISABLE_SSL_WARNINGS=true\" -v \"$HOME/.f5_cli:/root/.f5_cli\" -v \"$(pwd):/f5-cli\" f5devcentral/f5-cli:latest f5 $@\n```\n\n   * Notes: \n      * To post a declaration, make sure that the current directory is at where the declarative files are located. This will let the docker container to mount the local directory onto the container \"$(pwd):/f5-cli\" and process the declarative files with f5-cli container.\n      * Ensure that the config directory .f5_cli is mounted to the container so the container can authenticate and communicate properly with a target device.\n\n### Build F5 CLI Docker container locally\n```bash\ndocker build -t f5-cli:latest .\n```\n## User Documentation\n\nSee the [documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/sdk/f5-cli/) for details on installation, usage and much more.\n\n## Source Repository\n\nSee the source repository [here](https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-cli).\n\n## Filing Issues and Getting Help\n\nIf you come across a bug or other issue when using the CLI, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-cli/issues) to submit an issue for our team.  You can also see the current known issues on that page, which are tagged with a Known Issue label.  \n\nF5 CLI is community-supported.

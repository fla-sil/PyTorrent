This will uninstall previous versions if detected.\n\n2) System-wide, as standalone program: if you use Debian, or a Debian\nderivative, such as Ubuntu, just install the Debian package; otherwise, download\nand extract the tarball, then open a terminal into the extracted folder and run\n\"sudo python setup.py install\". Notice this will install it also as a\nsystem-wide nautilus script: single users can enable it using for instance\nnautilus-scripts-manager\n(see http://www.pietrobattiston.it/nautilus-scripts-manager )\n\n3) Single-user, as standalone program: just open a terminal into the extracted\nfolde and run \"./gallery-uploader\". Do not try to install with \"python setup.py\"\nto private directories: it won't work.\n\n===== What are its requirements? =====\n\nYou need\n  * Python (version 2.6 or higher),\n  * python-xdg,\n  * python-argparse (already present in Python 2.7),\n  * pygtk (2.12 or later should work, though 2.14 is required for usage in standalone mode; the version of the gtk+ libraries must be 2.16 or later),\nall preinstalled in many Linux installations, and\n  * galleryremote ( http://pietrobattiston.it/galleryremote ), which does the real work of communicating with remote Gallery instances.\n    \nIf python-gnomekeyring is present, passwords will be safely stored with GNOME\nKeyring.\n\nGallery-uploader was created to be used from Nautilus, GNOME's default\nfilemanager, but it is in no way tied to it: if you prefer, you can use it from\nshell, by giving the names of the images to load as arguments. If it doesn't get\nany argument, it will open a small browser which can be used to select the\ndesired pictures. This browser, which makes gallery-uploader a real standalone\nprogram, requires the additional dependence python-gnome in order to work.\n\n===== Old configuration files =====\n\nUntil version 1.11, Gallery-uploader relied on another library: gup.\nIts configuration files may be left in a folder called \".gup\" inside your home\ndirectory. The first time you run a newer version of Gallery-uploader, it will\nimport them automatically. Afterwhile, if you do not use gup directly, you can\nsafely delete that folder.\n\n===== Who should I blame if this sucks? =====\n\nPietro Battiston - <me@pietrobattiston.it>\n\n===== How to translate to my language? =====\n\nYou must have an account on http://www.transifex.net . Then, visit\n\nhttp://www.transifex.net/projects/p/galleryuploader/c/default/\n\nAssuming that your language doesn't exist, click \"Add a new translation\" and\nupload the .po file for your language (which doesn't have to necessarily contain\ntranslated strings already).

The callable \n              object is treated as a pre-condition when annotating function parameters and a \n              post-condition when annotating the return value. The value passed or returned will be \n              passed to the callable and an error will be raised if the result is not true. \n              \n              Example \n                  ``def f( x: lambda x: x > 0 ): # f() only accepting values greater than zero``\n                  \n                  ``def g(x) -> lambda y: y >= 0: # g() must return a value >= 0``\n        \n        \n        DEFAULTS, *ARG, AND **KWD\n        --------------------------------------\n        Parameters with default values, as well as *arg and **kwd arguments can also have\n        their types declared:\n            \n            @checked\n            def function(x:<type declaration>, y:<type declaration>=1, *args:<type declaration>, **kwds:<type declaration):\n        \n        \n        DEBUG MODE:\n        -----------------------------\n        @checked is intended to be used as a tool during \n        development and testing to help identify errors more quickly. For\n        this reason ``@checked`` is only functional in debug mode\n        (i.e. when ``__debug__ == True``). If not in debug mode it is defined\n        simply as,\n        \n            def checked(f):\n                return f\n                \n        \n        MOTIVATION:\n        -----------\n        The original motivation for this function was my attempt to apply the excercises outlined in Ben Nadel's whitepaper, \n        \"Object Calisthenics\" (http://www.bennadel.com/resources/uploads/2012/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf). \n        \n        One of Nadel's excercises is to, \"wrap all primitives and Strings.\" What he means is that instead of passing simple\n        ints, floats, and strings to a function, you'd create simple subclasses of int, float and str to represent the\n        type of data the parameter actually represents and to protect you from accidently passing an integer that\n        represents Hours to a function that is intended to work with dollar ammounts, for example. \n        \n        Of course, Nadel wrote his paper with Java in mind, so the java compiler would actually catch an error like that. \n        In attempting to apply that recommendation to python something was needed in order implement type checking. \n        Not finding a suitable package after an exhaustive five minute search of the internet I decided to try to \n        implement my one on my own (okay, I really wanted to see if I could do it or not).\n        \n        \n        LIMITATIONS\n        -----------\n        *  there's currently no way to verify if the default value specified for a parameter violates the \n           type declaration for that parameter.\n                Example:\n                    def f( x:int=\"bad default value\" ):\n                        ....\n              \n              Hopefully the fact that the type declaration is RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU will be enough to \n              get you to use the right type. \n              \n              This actually has at least one legitamate use, actually, in the case where the default value\n              is a magic value (typically None) which indicates that the user didn't supply a value:\n                  \n                  def f( x:int=None )\n                      # user is never intended to specify a value of None. User is expected \n                      # to either supply an int or no value at all.\n                      \n                      if x is None:\n                          ...do something special...\n            \n        * If the annotations are callable objects, they can only operate on a single parameter, or the return,\n          value. The validation cannot evaluate all of the parameters -- for example you can't write a\n          pre-condition that checks that the parameters are ordered from least to greatest.\n        \n        \n        KNOWN ISSUES:\n        -------------\n        Although an error is raised as it should be, the text of the error message for a container containing and \n        element of the wrong type is not clear\n    \n    type_proxy(typename)\n        type_proxy(typename) is used when an actual typename cannot be used because \n        it is not yet defined in the namespace and cannot be. \n        \n        The two typical causes are, \n        \n        1. Using a class in an annotation of a method of that same class.\n            Example:\n                class A:\n                    @checked\n                    @classmethod\n                    def factory(cls, ...) -> A: # Error, when the annotation is processed, A has not yet been defined\n                        ...\n            Solution:\n                class A:\n                    @checked\n                    @classmethod\n                    def factory(cls, ...) -> type_proxy('A') # valid\n                        ...\n                        \n        2. Trying to create an annotation which refers to a class not yet defined, which itself uses an annotation\n           that refers back to _this_ class (i.e. circular references). Because the two classes refer to each other\n           the solution is not so simple as to just move the second class definition before the first.\n        \n            Example:\n                class A:\n                    @checked\n                    def to_b(self) -> B : # Error: B not yet defined\n                        return B(self)\n                        \n                class B:\n                    @checked\n                    def to_a(self) -> A : # A refers to B and B refers to A, so it doesn't matter\n                        return A(self)    # which class is defined first, there's going to be an error.\n                    \n            Solution:\n                class A:\n                    @checked\n                    def to_b(self) -> type_proxy(\"B\") : # Fixed\n                        return B(self)\n                        \n                class B:\n                    ...unchanged...", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "UNKNOWN", "keywords": null, "license": "UNKNOWN", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "pycheck", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pycheck/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pycheck/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "UNKNOWN"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pycheck/0.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Type checking tools for debugging and developing Python code", "version": "0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            checked(f)<br>        checked is a function decorator that uses function annotations as type declarations<br>        and verifies that the function has been passed, and is returning, the <br>        correct types of values. <br>        <br>        Yes, yes, I know, this is python and we're not supposed to have to have<br>        type checking.

Because the two classes refer to each other<br>           the solution is not so simple as to just move the second class definition before the first.<br>        <br>            Example:<br>                class A:<br>                    @checked<br>                    def to_b(self) -&gt; B : # Error: B not yet defined<br>                        return B(self)<br>                        <br>                class B:<br>                    @checked<br>                    def to_a(self) -&gt; A : # A refers to B and B refers to A, so it doesn't matter<br>                        return A(self)    # which class is defined first, there's going to be an error.<br>                    <br>            Solution:<br>                class A:<br>                    @checked<br>                    def to_b(self) -&gt; type_proxy(\"B\") : # Fixed<br>                        return B(self)<br>                        <br>                class B:<br>                    ...unchanged...\n          </div>"}, "last_serial": 797041, "releases": {"0.1": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "9f116796c9e9c7f4d32da8fe02f67632", "sha256": "c5d9de6dc66d6ec36e6ce837665e784558df8609f1f6c00ff356cbf9ef5dcbad"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "pycheck-0.1.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "9f116796c9e9c7f4d32da8fe02f67632", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 12880, "upload_time": "2013-01-22T02:55:09", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2013-01-22T02:55:09.419475Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/fe/b0/1791c383d7fd9d1d2ecdd7412c0ccdbf55e3c2b49591cd3eb220d7f849a7/pycheck-0.1.tar.gz", "yanked": false}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "ce255377e487357e226d82bade6afb51", "sha256": "7998010296541a38bf05904628d937ec3b7918ce4319f0d99527bccf716dcdce"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "pycheck-0.1.zip", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "ce255377e487357e226d82bade6afb51", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 17202, "upload_time": "2013-01-22T02:55:11", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2013-01-22T02:55:11.067700Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/10/48/d9d4c7cd178f0cde50992297cc05c901656eec459546fea302c856ed0bc0/pycheck-0.1.zip", "yanked": false}], "0.1dev": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "29fbadcf6bffc337a6071f6aeb11222b", "sha256": "23d44ee3da5f8c88babf0737ef7263bb7c8af51a45cc6431bb3167fb67f063a2"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "pycheck-0.1dev.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "29fbadcf6bffc337a6071f6aeb11222b", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 7939, "upload_time": "2013-01-21T05:07:33", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2013-01-21T05:07:33.897372Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8e/2c/987f868932ca0d00eac1267c0953e48512c136f2f0589fea18fcf6b283e9/pycheck-0.1dev.tar.gz", "yanked": false}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "8955982bb3408279a1bdbd3483f32212", "sha256": "6152ffc3bdb359415c77ea71d55a6df70abee0f3323fda5246b5499e99b16471"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "pycheck-0.1dev.zip", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "8955982bb3408279a1bdbd3483f32212", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 9366, "upload_time": "2013-01-21T05:07:39", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2013-01-21T05:07:39.061446Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ee/34/3f4a6e3814eca304628c3c8fa1032c04eb1aa6f17928b42f322dccb21c02/pycheck-0.1dev.zip", "yanked": false}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "9f116796c9e9c7f4d32da8fe02f67632", "sha256": "c5d9de6dc66d6ec36e6ce837665e784558df8609f1f6c00ff356cbf9ef5dcbad"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "pycheck-0.1.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "9f116796c9e9c7f4d32da8fe02f67632", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 12880, "upload_time": "2013-01-22T02:55:09", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2013-01-22T02:55:09.419475Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/fe/b0/1791c383d7fd9d1d2ecdd7412c0ccdbf55e3c2b49591cd3eb220d7f849a7/pycheck-0.1.tar.gz", "yanked": false}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "ce255377e487357e226d82bade6afb51", "sha256": "7998010296541a38bf05904628d937ec3b7918ce4319f0d99527bccf716dcdce"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "pycheck-0.1.zip", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "ce255377e487357e226d82bade6afb51", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 17202, "upload_time": "2013-01-22T02:55:11", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2013-01-22T02:55:11.067700Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/10/48/d9d4c7cd178f0cde50992297cc05c901656eec459546fea302c856ed0bc0/pycheck-0.1.zip", "yanked": false}], "timestamp": "Fri May  8 03:08:33 2020"}

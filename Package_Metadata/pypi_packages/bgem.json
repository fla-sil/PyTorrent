However its practical usage (from Python) have several issues:\n\n- Geometry bolean operations (based on OCC) doesn't preserve \"compatible\" geometry, i.e. boundary separation two volumes exists only once. This\n  makes major problems in meshing.\n- Lack of support to work with \"groups of shapes\". E.g. a group of subdomains fragmented by a fracture  network results in a mess of all resulting subshapes.\n  Note, that we must make a single fragmenting operation in order to get \"compatible\" geometry.\n- Compatible boundary shapes can only be retrieved from the final volume, loosing information about it's parts (e.g. boundary of internal hole vs. outer boundary).\n- The regions (physical groups in GMSH) are composed from the shapes, while the compatible geometry requests a single region per shape. So it seems logical to assigne regions to the shapes.\n- For thousands of regions, the internal GMSH/OCC algorithms are extremaly slow (probably do to quadratic complexity).\n- `gmsh-sdk` builds on semantics of GMSH scripting language leading to cumbersome usage from Python, namely for Fields and Options.\n\n\n\n## Features:\n### bgem.bspline\nLongterm goal to have own CAD like library producing only compatible geometries (indepdent of OCC).\n- representation of B-spline curves and surfaces\n- approximation of point clouds by B-spline curves and surfaces\n- intersections of curves and surfaces\n- composition of compatible 3D geometries using BREP format and B-splines\n- ultimate goal: fast algorithms for B-spline logical operations\n- work in progress\n\n### bgem.gmsh\nWrapping 'gmsh-sdk' meat and bones into enjoyable being.\n- documented interface to usefule GMSH options\n- documented and usable wrapper for 'Fields'\n- operations with groups of shapes\n- own association of shapes with regions, assigned just before meshing or even after meshing\n- work in progress\n\n### bgem.polygons\nDecomposition of the plane into disjoint polygons by line segments. \n- keep compatibility (i.e. single segment separting two polygons)\n- support for merging close points and segments with sharp angles (enhance regularity of resulting mesh)\n- support for assignment of regions (or other data) to the shapes (points, segments, polygons)\n- support for undo/redo of the operations\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installation from PYPI\n\nSystem-wide installation of a last version from PYPI.

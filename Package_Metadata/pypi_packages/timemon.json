Patch by Lukas Graf.\n\n- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.9 where the ``-u`` and ``-n`` options in\n  ``memmon`` were parsed incorrectly.  Patch by Harald Friessnegger.\n\n0.10 (2014-07-08)\n-----------------\n\n- Honor timeout in httok checks even on trying the connection.\n  Without it, processes that take make than 60 seconds to accept connections\n  and http_ok with TICK_60 events cause a permanent restart of the process.\n\n- ``httpok`` now sends a ``User-Agent`` header of ``httpok``.\n\n- Removed ``setuptools`` from the ``requires`` list in ``setup.py`` because\n  it caused installation issues on some systems.\n\n0.9 (2013-09-18)\n----------------\n\n- Added license.\n\n- Fixed bug in cmd line option validator for ProcessStateEmailMonitor\n  Bug report by Val Jordan\n\n- Added ``-u`` option to memmon the only send an email in case the restarted\n  process' uptime (in seconds) is below this limit.  This is useful to only\n  get notified if a processes gets restarted too frequently.\n  Patch by Harald Friessnegger.\n\n0.8 (2013-05-26)\n----------------\n\n- Superlance will now refuse to install on an unsupported version of Python.\n\n- Allow SMTP credentials to be supplied to ProcessStateEmailMonitor\n  Patch by Steven Davidson.\n\n- Added ``-n`` option to memmon that adds this name to the email\n  subject to identify which memmon process restarted a process.\n  Useful in case you run multiple supervisors that control\n  different processes with the same name.\n  Patch by Harald Friessnegger.\n\n- ProcessStateEmailMonitor now adds Date and Message-ID headers to emails.\n  Patch by Andrei Vereha.\n\n0.7 (2012-08-22)\n----------------\n\n- The ``crashmailbatch --toEmail`` option now accepts a comma-separated\n  list of email addresses.\n\n0.6 (2011-08-27)\n----------------\n\n- Separated unit tests into their own files\n\n- Created ``fatalmailbatch`` plugin\n\n- Created ``crashmailbatch`` plugin\n\n- Sphinxified documentation.\n\n- Fixed ``test_suite`` to use the correct module name in setup.py.\n\n- Fixed the tests for ``memmon`` to import the correct module.\n\n- Applied patch from Sam Bartlett: processes which are not autostarted\n  have pid \"0\".  This was crashing ``memmon``.\n\n- Add ``smtpHost`` command line flag to ``mailbatch`` processors.\n\n- Added ``crashsms`` from Juan Batiz-Benet\n\n- Converted ``crashmailbatch`` and friends from camel case to pythonic style\n\n- Fixed a bug where ``httpok`` would crash with the ``-b`` (in-body)\n  option.  Patch by Joaquin Cuenca Abela.\n\n- Fixed a bug where ``httpok`` would not handle a URL with a query string\n  correctly.  Patch by Joaquin Cuenca Abela.\n\n- Fixed a bug where ``httpok`` would not handle process names with a\n  group (\"group:process\") properly.  Patch by Joaquin Cuenca Abela.\n\n\n0.5 (2009-05-24)\n----------------\n\n- Added the ``memmon`` plugin, originally bundled with supervisor and\n  now moved to superlance.\n\n\n0.4 (2009-02-11)\n----------------\n\n- Added ``eager`` and ``not-eager`` options to the ``httpok`` plugin.\n\n  If ``not-eager`` is set, and no process being monitored is in the\n  ``RUNNING`` state, skip the URL check / mail message.\n\n\n0.3 (2008-12-10)\n----------------\n\n- Added ``gcore`` and ``coredir`` options to the ``httpok`` plugin.\n\n\n0.2 (2008-11-21)\n----------------\n\n- Added the ``crashmail`` plugin.\n\n\n0.1 (2008-09-18)\n----------------\n\n- Initial release\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://supervisord.org", "keywords": "supervisor monitoring", "license": "BSD-derived (http://www.repoze.org/LICENSE.txt)", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "timemon", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/timemon/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/timemon/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://supervisord.org"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/timemon/1.0.0.dev0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "timemon plugin for supervisord", "version": "1.0.0.dev0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"dev-next-release\">\n<h2>1.0.0-dev (Next Release)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped support for Python 2.5.</li>\n<li>Added support for Python 3.2 and 3.3.</li>\n<li>Changed shebang lines in all files from using \u201cpython -u\u201d to \u201cpython\u201d.\nAll of the eventlisteners in this package use supervisor.childutils, which\ndoes an explicit flush after every write to stdout.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"id1\">\n<h2>0.11 (2014-08-15)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for <tt>memmon</tt> to check against cumulative RSS of a process\nand all its child processes.

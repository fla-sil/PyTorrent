It can be optionally gzipped. Alternatively input can be read from stdin by using the dash character (-) as the input file name. The file must contain long reads, such as those from PacBio or Oxford Nanopore. The quality scores are ignored.\n\n### Optional input arguments\n\n__plasmid_data__: This is a FASTA file containing all of the plasmid typing sequences. This is generated by the plasmidpredictor_database_downloader script. It comes from the PlasmidFinder website, so please be sure to cite their paper (citation gets printed every time you run the script).\n\n__kmer__:  The most important parameter. 13 works well for Nanopore, 15 works well for PacBio, but you may need to play around with it for your data. Long reads have a high error rate, so if you set this too high, nothing will match (because it will contain errors). If you set it too low, everything will match, which isnt much use to you. Thinking about your data, on average how long of a stretch of bases can you get in your read without errors? This is what you should set your kmer to. For example, if you have an average of 1 error every 10 bases, then the ideal kmer would be 9.\n\n### Optional output arguments\n\n__filtered_reads_file__: Save the reads which contain the rep/inc sequences to a new FASTQ file. This is useful if you want to undertake a further assembly just on the plasmids.This file should not already exist. \n\n__output_file OUTPUT_FILE__: By default the results are printed to STDOUT. If you provide an output filename (which must not exist already), it will print the results to the file.\n\n__print_interval__: By default the whole file is processed and the final results are printed out. However you can get intermediate results printed after every X number of reads, which is useful if you are doing real time streaming of data into the application and can halt when you have enough information. They are separated by \"****\". \n\n__verbose__: Enable debugging mode where lots of extra output is printed to STDOUT.\n\n__version__: Print the version number and exit.\n\n\n### Optional advanced input arguments\n\n__max_gap__: Maximum gap for blocks to be contigous, measured in multiples of the k-mer size. This allows for short regions of elevated errors in the reads to be spanned.\n\n__margin__:  Expand the analysis to look at a few bases on either side of where the sequence is predicted to be on the read. This allows for k-mers to overlap the ends.\n\n__min_block_size__:  This is the minimum sub read size of a read to consider for indepth analysis after matching k-mers have been identified in the read. This speeds up the analysis quite a bit, but there is the risk that some reads may be missed, particularly if they have partial rep/inc sequences.\n\n__min_fasta_hits__: This is the minimum number of matching kmers in a read, for the read to be considered for analysis. It is a hard minimum threshold to speed up analysis.\n\n__min_perc_coverage__: Only report rep/inc sequences above this percentage coverage. Coverage in this instance is kmer coverage of the underlying sequence (rather than depth of coverage).\n\n__min_kmers_for_onex_pass__: The number of k-mers that must be present in the read for the initial onex pass of the database to be considered for further analysis. This speeds up the analysis quite a bit, but there is the risk that some reads may be missed, particularly if they have partial rep/inc sequences.\n\n# Output\nThe output is tab delmited and printed to STDOUT by default. You can optionally print it to a file using the '-o' parameter. If you would like to see intermediate results, you can tell it to print every X reads with the '-p' parameter, separated by '****'.

Low coverage results are not shown (controlled by the --min_perc_coverage parameter).<br><br>__ACCESSION__: This is the accession number from where the typing sequence originates. You can look this up at NCBI or EBI.<br><br>__DATABASE__: This is where the data has come from, which is currently always plasmidfinder.<br><br>__PRODUCT__: This is the full product of the gene as found in the database.<br><br># Resource usage<br>For an 800Mbyte FASTQ file (unzipped) of long reads from a Oxford Nanopore MinION containing Salmonella required 80MB of RAM and took under 1 minute.<br><br><br><br><br>\n          </div>"}, "last_serial": 4209051, "releases": {"0.1.0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "d87a7ec19e0aa5b59ce35c978457f4bf", "sha256": "924154e058b37fdfc58a19e71440c83154559997faa44c2f175010ec398e14ed"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "plasmidpredictor-0.1.0-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "d87a7ec19e0aa5b59ce35c978457f4bf", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "cp36", "requires_python": null, "size": 91234, "upload_time": "2018-08-26T19:27:49", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2018-08-26T19:27:49.578048Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/77/59/4e179e3af364544457a4d1471b57a1a45e4691b4bc8113a5fc779e55977c/plasmidpredictor-0.1.0-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl", "yanked": false}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "8cf0c7226e777434f61bb1c651b23470", "sha256": "6c0d2bea5febbc0618417b20656fd8ff108e8d6647a8b7d57f793a45060ae86b"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "plasmidpredictor-0.1.0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "8cf0c7226e777434f61bb1c651b23470", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 87215, "upload_time": "2018-08-26T19:27:50", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2018-08-26T19:27:50.907664Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/1a/34/3e46e17d9bb04ad09b36d6f1805c09a6d09cf3ed346145ce8976075c63f0/plasmidpredictor-0.1.0.tar.gz", "yanked": false}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "d87a7ec19e0aa5b59ce35c978457f4bf", "sha256": "924154e058b37fdfc58a19e71440c83154559997faa44c2f175010ec398e14ed"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "plasmidpredictor-0.1.0-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "d87a7ec19e0aa5b59ce35c978457f4bf", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "cp36", "requires_python": null, "size": 91234, "upload_time": "2018-08-26T19:27:49", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2018-08-26T19:27:49.578048Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/77/59/4e179e3af364544457a4d1471b57a1a45e4691b4bc8113a5fc779e55977c/plasmidpredictor-0.1.0-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl", "yanked": false}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "8cf0c7226e777434f61bb1c651b23470", "sha256": "6c0d2bea5febbc0618417b20656fd8ff108e8d6647a8b7d57f793a45060ae86b"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "plasmidpredictor-0.1.0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "8cf0c7226e777434f61bb1c651b23470", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 87215, "upload_time": "2018-08-26T19:27:50", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2018-08-26T19:27:50.907664Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/1a/34/3e46e17d9bb04ad09b36d6f1805c09a6d09cf3ed346145ce8976075c63f0/plasmidpredictor-0.1.0.tar.gz", "yanked": false}], "timestamp": "Fri May  8 02:53:38 2020"}

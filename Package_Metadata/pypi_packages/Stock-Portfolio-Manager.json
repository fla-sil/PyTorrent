I developed this on Win7 using Python 3.8.2 32-bit on Win 7\n2. Make sure you have PIP (latest version I have used is 3)\n    1. Verify by executing: \n        pip --version\n    2. If pip isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already installed, then first try to bootstrap it from the standard library:\n        python -m ensurepip --default-pip\n    3. Ensure pip is up to date\n        python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n3. install following:\n    1. pip install alpha_vantage\n    2. pip install pandas\n    3. pip install matplotlib\n    4. pip install tkcalendar\n4. In addition I have used tkinter module for graphics, which is available as standard library\n5. Before you execute Portfolio Manager\n    1 Create a sub-directory 'scriptdata' in the same folder where you copied the source code (.py files)\n    2. Get developer key from Alpha Vantage website: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#support\n6. First use of Portfolio Manager\n    1. Use menu 'Help->Add Key & Data Folder' and provide the Alpha Vantage key & path where you want to keep data files\n    2. The folder you specify is used to store CSV files retrieved from Alpha Vantage in 'Test' mode of application\n7. General description of Portfolio Manager application using alpha vantage to manage stock portfolio & do research\nv0.4 - Features as below\n   1. File->Save current scripts in tree as portfolio  to a file\n   2. File->Open existing portfolio file and render data in tree\n   3. Manage Portfolio->Add script to tree via menu\n   4. Manage Portfolio->Refresh selected script from tree. \n         This takes current market price and updates the current value for that script\n   5. Manage portfolio->Delete selected script from portfolio. \n         Entire data is deleted from Tree, but the file is not updated\n   6. Analyze script->Get Quote. Search script (type first few chars \n         & enter or click search button). Click Get Quote to get current price.\n         You can select specific indicator to see the performance graph of current script\n         You can use Add script button to add the script in Tree\n   7. Analyze Script->Show historical proce series of selected script. Shows close price graph\n         Note: this should be move to right click menu\n   8. Analyze Script->Compare Price Vs SMA. Currently shows popup graph\n         Note: 7 & 8 needs to be merged and the graph needs to be shown in main window on\n                 right click menu\n   9. Help-> Test Mode (On/Off). Toggle the test mode. In Test mode we use file to \n         load specific script data\n   10.Mouse right click->Delete. Deletes the currently selected portfolio entry from tree only.\n         The data is not saved to file\n   11. Mouse right click->Modify selected script from tree. You can change the quantity,\n         rate, commission etc. Based on the values the cost of investment will be updated\n         This will also take current market price and update all current value field in Tree\n   5. Mouse right click->Performance. Shows current value for total holding, shows other\n         comparison graph and return graph as well\n         Note: this needs to be moved in main window\nv0.5 - Bug fixes and features\n   1. Bugfix-get quote was getting called for each row in Open file. Fixed by passing DataFrame from OpenFile to get_stock_quote\n   2. Bugfix-in the performance graph the portfolio value is shown from last date of purchase with total holding instead of first date\n   3. Bugfix-There was a pandas warning while doing cumulative sum of all the holding. Fixed that using .loc\n   5. Correction - moved  Analyze Script->Show historical proce series of selected script to Mouse right click->Daily closing Vs SMA\n         Added 20 day SMA graph in the same plot\n   6. Added graphs on right click on selected script. Handling of movement is also taken care.\nv0.6 - Added test data support via downloaded file for all except get_quote_endpoint and search_endpoint\n   1. How to use Test data option (ideal for offline demos without Get Quote and Add/Modify functionality)?\n      1.1 From Help->Test Mode (On/Off) you can toggle the test mode\n      1.2 All the historical data including price & indicator and end point quote is cached in csv files in folder 'ScriptData'\n      1.3 The free key of Alpha vantage has limitation of 5 calls per 5 minute/ total 500 calls per day\n      1.4 Suggested approach is extract all data once daily.\n      1.5 Note the script search in the Get Quote and add script dialog is still ONLINE\n      1.6 You can select existing portfolio file to open. You have to make sure that you have the specific script end point quote file\n      1.7 Once the portfolio is open all functionality should work fine\n v0.7 - Base version with all graphs and bug fixes and also code identified for mouse move & click on graphs\n v0.8 - Added OHLC Candlestick graph in backtestsma\n v0.9\n      1. Added Research graph popup dialog - can be accessed via menu & left click on script graph\n      2. Added on mouse move show amount for DailyVsSMA graph. Needs improvement\n v1.0 - All beta features complete\n      1. Added consolidated portfolio performance screen\n      2. Added Apple stock download to download feature\n v1.0.1 - Added new menu and dialog for entering alpha vantage key and selecting data file folder used in 'Test' mode\n      1. All classes using Test mode now accept data file folder in their constructor\n      2. TestData class and download data classes are changed to accept folder during runtime\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/vinaybhide/portfoliomanager", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "Stock-Portfolio-Manager", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Stock-Portfolio-Manager/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Stock-Portfolio-Manager/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/vinaybhide/portfoliomanager"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Stock-Portfolio-Manager/1.0.1b1/", "requires_dist": ["pandas", "matplotlib"], "requires_python": ">=3.8.2", "summary": "Portfolio Manager using python, pandas, matplotlib, alpha vantage", "version": "1.0.1b1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>portfoliomanager</h1>\n<p>Pre-requisites for development:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I developed this on Win7 using Python 3.8.2 32-bit on Win 7</li>\n<li>Make sure you have PIP (latest version I have used is 3)\n<ol>\n<li>Verify by executing:\npip --version</li>\n<li>If pip isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already installed, then first try to bootstrap it from the standard library:\npython -m ensurepip --default-pip</li>\n<li>Ensure pip is up to date\npython -m pip install --upgrade pip</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>install following:\n<ol>\n<li>pip install alpha_vantage</li>\n<li>pip install pandas</li>\n<li>pip install matplotlib</li>\n<li>pip install tkcalendar</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>In addition I have used tkinter module for graphics, which is available as standard library</li>\n<li>Before you execute Portfolio Manager\n1 Create a sub-directory 'scriptdata' in the same folder where you copied the source code (.py files)\n2.

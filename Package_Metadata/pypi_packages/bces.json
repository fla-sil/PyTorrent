Some of the advantages of BCES regression compared to ordinary least squares fitting (quoted from Akritas & Bershady 1996):\n        \n        * it allows for measurement errors on both variables\n        * it permits the measurement errors for the two variables to be dependent\n        * it permits the magnitudes of the measurement errors to depend on the measurements\n        * other \"symmetric\" lines such as the bisector and the orthogonal regression can be constructed.\n        \n        In order to understand how to perform and interpret the regression results, please read the paper. \n        \n        # Installation\n        \n        Using `pip`:\n        \n            pip install bces\n        \n        If that does not work, you can install it using the `setup.py` script:\n        \n            python setup.py install\n        \n        You may need to run the last command with `sudo`.\n        \n        Install the package with a symlink, so that changes to the source files will be immediately available:\n        \n            python setup.py develop\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        # Usage \n        \n        \timport bces.bces\n        \ta,b,aerr,berr,covab=bces.bces.bces(x,xerr,y,yerr,cov)\n        \n        Arguments:\n        \n        - *x,y* : 1D data arrays\n        - *xerr,yerr*: measurement errors affecting x and y, 1D arrays\n        - *cov* : covariance between the measurement errors, 1D array\n        \n        If you have no reason to believe that your measurement errors are correlated (which is usual the case), you can provide an  array of zeroes as input for *cov*:\n        \n            cov = numpy.zeros_like(x)\n        \n        Output:\n        \n        - *a,b* : best-fit parameters a,b of the linear regression such that *y = Ax + B*. \n        - *aerr,berr* : the standard deviations in a,b\n        - *covab* : the covariance between a and b (e.g. for plotting confidence bands)\n        \n        Each element of the arrays *a*, *b*, *aerr*, *berr* and *covab* correspond to the result of one of the different BCES lines: *y|x*, *x|y*, bissector and orthogonal, as detailed in the table below.

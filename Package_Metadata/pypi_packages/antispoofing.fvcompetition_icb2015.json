By default, the command line sequence::\n\n  $ ./python bootstrap.py\n  $ ./bin/buildout\n\nThere are a few exceptions, which are not automatically downloaded:\n\nBob\n---\nTo install Bob_, please visit http://www.idiap.ch/software/bob and follow the installation instructions.\nPlease verify that you have at least version 2.0 of Bob installed.\nIf you have installed Bob in a non-standard directory, please open the buildout.cfg file from the base directory and set the ``prefixes`` directory accordingly.\n\n.. note::\n  The experiments that we report in the Paper_ were generated with Bob_ version 2.0.\n  If you use different versions of either of these packages, the results might differ slightly.\n  For example, we are aware that, due to some initialization differences, the results using Bob 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 are not identical, but similar.\n\n\nImage Databases\n---------------\nThe experiments are run on external image database.\nWe do not provide the images from the database itselve.\nHence, please contact the database owners to obtain a copy of the images.\nThe database used in the competition can be downloaded here:\n\n- Spoofing-Attack Finger Vein Database [``fvspoofingattack``]: http://www.idiap.ch/dataset/fvspoofingattack\n\n.. note::\n  After downloading the databases, you will need to tell our software, where it can find them by changing the **run_icb2015_competition.sh** file.\n  In particular, please update the ``PATHDATABASE`` to indicate the directory of the dataset: PATHDATABASE=\"YOUR_PATH/FVspoofingAttack\".\n\n\nPlease let all other configuration parameters unchanged as this might influence the competition analysis and, hence, the reproducibility of the results.\n\nGetting help\n------------\nIn case anything goes wrong, please feel free to open a new ticket in our GitLab_ page, or send an email to pedro.tome@idiap.ch.\n\n\nRecreating the results of the Paper_\n====================================\n\nAfter successfully setting up the databases, you are now able to run the anti-spoofing finger vein evaluation as explained in the Paper_.\n\nRunning the experiments\n-----------------------\nThe competition results are run using the **run_icb2015_competition.sh** file.\n\nAdditionally, the individual scripts used can be found in ``bin/`` directory.\nSee ``./bin/icb2015_baseline_countermeasure.py --help`` and ``./bin/icb2015_evaluation_results.py --help`` for a complete list of options.\n\n1.

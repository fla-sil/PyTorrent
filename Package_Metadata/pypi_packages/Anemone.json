The typical use cases is monitoring of long \nrunning programs on remote machines. Anemone lets the long running program (scientific analysis or \nany other type of long running program) create reports which can be continously updated through the\nrunning of the analysis. Anemone will run in a separate thread and talk to interested listeners,\ntypically plotting programs on remote machines. These programs can get a list of reports and\ncontinously plot the evolvolution of the reported variables.\n\nAnemone includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that can connect to a running analysis and show\na list of monitors. The monitors can be plotted and the plots will update automatically.\n\nCurrently only 2D plot reports are supported, but more advanced reports are also planned.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nAn example of using Anemone in an application is included in the repository. The analysis program\nwill publish the monitors on a TCP port, via local IPC over a unix domain sockets or any other \ntransport supported by the currently installed version of ZeroMQ.\n\nIf the example program communicates over IPC via the file ``my_com`` then you can connect to it\nwith the GUI and inspect the progress of the analysis live by running::\n\n    python -m anemone wxgui ipc://my_com\n\nYou can connect mulitple GUI programs and connect/reconnect as often as you like. You can even\nconnect before the analysis program has started. The GUI will try to connect each second until the\nanalysis program responds.\n\nSecurity\n--------\n\nThe current proof-of-concept version of Anemone communicates over ZeroMQ via Python pickles which\nis NOT secure! Do not use Anemone in an open network without replacing the pickles with some other\nserialization format!\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nAnemone is a Python package. It has been tested with Python 2.7 on Ubuntu Linux and requires the \nZeroMQ Python bindings, wxPython and matplotlib to be available. No installation is required besides\nmaking sure the ``anemone`` package is on the PYTHONPATH.\n\nVersion and stability\n---------------------\n\nThe current version of Anemone is 0.01 and should be treated as a proof of concept and not as\nproduction quality software.\n\nCopyright and license\n---------------------\n\nAnemone is copyright Tormod Landet, 2014.

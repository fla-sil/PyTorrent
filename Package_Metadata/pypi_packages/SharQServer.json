Based on the [Leaky Bucket Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket#The_Leaky_Bucket_Algorithm_as_a_Queue), SHARQ lets you create queues dynamically and update their rate limits in real time.\n\nSHARQ consists of two components - the core component and the server component. The [SHARQ core](https://github.com/plivo/sharq) is built on [Redis](https://redis.io), using Python and Lua, and the SHARQ Server is built using Flask and Gevent and talks HTTP.\n\n## Installation\n\nSHARQ Server can be installed using [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html) as follows:\n\n```\npip install sharqserver\n```\n\n## Running the server\n\nSHARQ server can be started with the following command. A simple SHARQ config file can be [found here](https://github.com/plivo/sharq-server/blob/master/sharq.conf).\n\n```\n$sharq-server --config sharq.conf\n```\n\nEnsure the SHARQ server is up by making a HTTP request.\n\n```\n$curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/\n{\n  \"message\": \"Hello, SharQ!\"\n}\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nCheck out [sharq.io](http://sharq.io) for documentation.\n\n## License\n\n```\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Plivo Inc\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

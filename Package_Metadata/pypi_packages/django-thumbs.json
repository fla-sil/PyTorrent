Works with any StorageBackend.\n\n\nFeatures\n========\n  \n* Easy to integrate in your code (no database changes, works as an ImageField)\n* Works perfectly with any StorageBackend\n* Generates thumbnails after image is uploaded into memory\n* Deletes thumbnails when the image file is deleted\n* Provides easy access to the thumbnails' URLs (similar method as with ImageField)\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n* Python 2.5+\n* Django 1.1+\n* PIL (Python Image Library)\n\n\nGetting It\n==========\n\nYou can get Django-Thumbs by using pip or easy_install:\n\n::\n\n  $ pip install django-thumbs\n  or\n  $ easy_install django-thumbs\n\nIf you want to install it from source, grab the git repository from github and run setup.py:\n\n::\n\n  $ git clone git://github.com/skitoo/django-thumbs.git\n  $ cd django-thumbs\n  $ python setup.py install\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n* Import it in your models.py and replace ImageField with ImageWithThumbsField in your model\n* Add a sizes attribute with a list of sizes you want to use for the thumbnails\n* Make sure your have defined MEDIA_URL in your settings.py\n* That's it!\n\nWorking example\n===============\n\n::\n\n    from django.db import models\n    from django_thumbs.db.models import ImageWithThumbsField\n\n    class Person(models.Model):\n        photo = ImageWithThumbsField(upload_to='images', sizes=((125,125),(200,200)))\n        second_photo = ImageWithThumbsField(upload_to='images')\n\nIn this example we have a Person model with 2 image fields.\n\nYou can see the field second_photo doesn't have a sizes attribute. This field works exactly the same way as a normal ImageField.\n\nThe field photo has a sizes attribute specifying desired sizes for the thumbnails. This field works the same way as ImageField but it also creates the desired thumbnails when uploading a new file and deletes the thumbnails when deleting the file.\n\nWith ImageField you retrieve the URL for the image with: someone.photo.url With ImageWithThumbsField you retrieve it the same way. You also retrieve the URL for every thumbnail specifying its size: In this example we use someone.photo.url_125x125 and someone.photo.url_200x200 to get the URL of both thumbnails.\n\nUninstall\n=========\nAt any time you can go back and use ImageField again without altering the database or anything else. Just replace ImageWithThumbsField with ImageField again and make sure you delete the sizes attribute. Everything will work the same way it worked before using django-thumbs. Just remember to delete generated thumbnails in the case you don't want to have them anymore.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/skitoo/django-thumbs", "keywords": "django thumbs image", "license": "New BSD License", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "django-thumbs", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-thumbs/", "platform": "OS Independent", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-thumbs/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/skitoo/django-thumbs"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-thumbs/0.4/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Django-Thumbs is the easiest way to create thumbnails for your images with Django.

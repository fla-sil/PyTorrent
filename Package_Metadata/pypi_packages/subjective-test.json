Those techniques assume that the data is \nmeasured at least at an ordinal level and define a sequence of scores to represent a tied rank when they have precisely \nan equal numeric value.\n\nIn this paper, we show that the definition of tied rank, as mentioned above, is not suitable for Mean Opinion Scores \n(MOS) and might be misleading conclusions of rank-based statistical techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a method to \novercome this issue by transforming the MOS values considering their 95% Confidence Intervals. The rank correlation \ncoefficients and ranked-based statistical tests can then be safely applied to the transformed values. We also provide \nopen-source software packages in different programming languages to utilize the application of our transformation method \nin the quality of experience domain.\n\n## Code\nHow to use?\n\n``` python\n    mos = [10, 6, 5.5]\n    ci = [4, 2, 0.2]\n    t = transform_mos(mos, ci)\n    #  expected_rank = [3, 1.5, 1.5]\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Contact\n\nBabak Naderi, babak.naderi[at]tu-berlin.de\n\n## Citation\nNaderi B, Moeller S.

The library is\ndistributed with tables for p-values (type I error) for N=3,4,...,20\nand for N=30,40,...,100. These tables cover the most common cases. New\ntables are computed when needed, although completion might take a few\nhours. Type II error tables are not included to keep the package size\nsmall.\n\nSee `scripts\\compute_basic_tables.py` for an example script to\npre-compute tables you might need. The script makes use of the `joblib\n<http://packages.python.org/joblib/>`_ library to distribute the\ncomputations on multiple cores.\n\nDependencies\n============\n\n`mtest` requires `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ and `PyMC <http://code.google.com/p/pymc/>`_.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n`mtest` is released under the GPL v3.

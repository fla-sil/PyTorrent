Download the html for that thread; first creating a folder for the board, and then a folder for the thread and its contents.\r\n        \r\n        3.) Image and Thumbnail links are harvested, and the html links are redirected to act as local links (that means when the thread dies, the images will still appear in the thread when you open it).\r\n        \r\n        4.) The Thumbnails are downloaded to a subfolder 'thumbs' in the thread's folder, and the images are downloaded directly to the thread's folder.\r\n        \r\n        5.) You're done! The script closes and you can browse away with your own personal archive.\r\n        \r\n        NOTE: If the tool is interrupted, it will recognize which images have already been downloaded, and skip them. That also means if the thread has been updated since you archived it, you can run this tool again and only download the updated html and new images.

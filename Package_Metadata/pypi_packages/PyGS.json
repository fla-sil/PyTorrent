GETTING THE ENVIRONMENT SET UP\n-\ta.) Getting a proper environment depends heavily on the OS\n-\t\tthat you are using. If using Ubuntu, most installation can\n-\t\tbe done via synaptic, if using mac or windows it is a little\n-\t\tmore difficult.\n-\tb.) First make sure you have a working fortran 90 compiler.\n-\t\tI used gfortran for development. Ubuntu already has \n-\t\tgfortran, mac doesn't so you will need to install it. I \n-\t\tdon't even know for Windows.\n-\tc.) Get python. Ubuntu and mac are shipped with a version of\n-\t\tpython. Don't use it. Install the latest 2.x version (NOT 3.x!)\n-\t\tusing your favourite method. HOWEVER, one nice option\n-\t\tto consider at this point is EPD - Enthought Python\n-\t\tDistribution. It comes shipped with basically every module\n-\t\tyou'll need for PyGS and is very easy to install. \n-\td.) If going the way of EPD, install the 64-bit version I think.\n-\t\tPerhaps in the future we may need to use 32-bit. But\n-\t\ttry the 64-bit for now. \n-\te.) Once EPD is installed, in terminal, type \"which python\".\n-\t\tYou should see the python.exe in the EPD folder, not\n-\t\tthe standard one shipped with your OS. If it is not the \n-\t\tcorrect python, you probably have to modify your \n-\t\t.bashrc file with a line saying: \n-\t\t\"export PATH = \"<path to epd installation folder>\":$PATH\"\n-\t\tor something very similar. \n-\tf.) If NOT going the way of EPD, then point your $PATH variable\n-\t\tto the new python interpreter you installed by adding \n-\t\tsomething like \n-\t\t\"export PATH = \"<path to  installation folder>\":$PATH\"\n-\t\t.bashrc file. \n-\n-\tf.) Once this is correct (either EPD or not), type \"easy_install pip\", \n-\t\twhich will install the module pip, which is an easy way to \n-\t\tdownload and install most good modules.\n-\tg.) If NOT using EPD, then you will need to install a few modules\n-\t\twith pip. So type in terminal:\n-\t\t> pip install numpy\n-\t\t> pip install scipy\n-\t\t> pip install matplotlib\n-\t\t> pip install cosmolopy\n-\t\t> pip install asciitable\n-\t\t> pip install ipython\n-\t\t> pip install readline\n-\th.) If using EPD, then there are only a couple of things to install:\n-\t\t> pip install cosmolopy\n-\t\t> pip install asciitable\n-\t    You can also update the others:\n-\t\t> pip update numpy\n-\t\t> pip update scipy\n-\t\t> pip update matplotlib\n-\n-\ti.) Now your python setup is ready for PyGS.\n-\n-2. INSTALLING PyGS\n-\ta.) There are two ways to go here: If you just want to use PyGS\n-\t\tand not  work on it, (or just want to try it out easily before you\n-\t\tstart working on it), then download just the tar.gz file under the\n-\t\tdist folder. If you want to work on PyGS, then download\n-\t\teverything under the PyGS folder (that includes setup.py,\n-\t\tREADME.txt etc).\n-\n- - To install the just usable version:\n-\tb.) After downloading the tar.gz file, untar it, then in the terminal,\n-\t\tenter the untarred directory and then type:\n-\t\t> python setup.py install\n-  \t\t(You may need to type sudo beforehand depending on \n-\t\twhere your files are installed).\n-\n-\tc.) As long as everything installs correctly (it may not, I've only tested\n-\t\tit with my specific OS and compiler etc.) then you are right to go.\n-\n- - What to do with the source code:\n-\td.) If you would like to have the source in the same way that I do on \n-\t\tmy computer then you will have downloaded the whole PyGS\n-\t\tdirectory. The source code itself is under PyGS/PyGS. The \n-\t\tfortran code is under /fort. The only python file is the PyGS.py\n-\t\tfile, which contains the class with many methods. You can\n-\t\tquite simply install the modules to your root python installation\n-\t\tby running the install.sh script after you make changes. \n-\n-3. USING PyGS IN THE INTERPRETER\n-\ta.) Type ipython in the terminal. \n-\t\n-\tb.) type:\n-\t\t > from PyGS import PyGS\n-\t\tNOTE: what we are doing here is saying\n-\t\t\"from the package PyGS,import the module PyGS\"\n-\n-\tc.) A few handy things in ipython: typing a variable or class\n-\t\tname followed by a ? brings up information about that\n-\t\tclass/method/variable. I have tried to document PyGS\n-\t\tfairly well so doing this can help. For instance type\n-\t\t> PyGS.PyGS?\n-\t\tAlso, typing PyGS.PyGS.<tab> will bring up the methods\n-\t\tand variables that PyGS contains (NOTE the dot after\n-\t\tPyGS). Tab acts as an autocomplete. This is also very\n-\t\thelpful.\n-\n-\td.) Make sure that you have a file containing Survey information.\n-\t\tIf the file has a header with the information about each column\n-\t\tthen the class may automatically detect which columns \n-\t\tcorrespond to which variables (redshift, ra, dec etc). \n-\t\tHowever, this may not be the case, and the program may\n-\t\task you what columns correspond to what. So make sure\n-\t\tyou know where redshift, ra, dec and mag_r are.\n-\n-\te.) type:\n-\t\t> x = PyGS.PyGS(\"<full path to survey>\")\n-\t\tand follow the prompts if there are any. There are other options\n-\t\twhen importing the survey but you can explore them later.\n-\t\tWhat this will do is import the survey info to the current session\n-\t\tand importantly create a folder where your file is, named after\n-\t\tthe file which will house a similar file, formatted for future use\n-\t\tin the program (to make importing it easier next time).\n-\n-\tf.) type:\n-\t\t> x.<tab>\n-\t\ta list of methods will come up that you can perform on the survey.\n-\t\tJust choose one!

The package has been\nimplemented with ``suds==0.3.9``. It may not work with other versions.\n\n\nLimitations\n===========\n\nThe current implementation does not handle exceptions.\nThey are not transformed into SOAP ``Fault`` messages (as required\nby SOAP 1.1) but\nreported by the underlying transport protocol (\"HTTP\") (using\nHTTP error codes with HTML messages).\nThe reason for this limitation: SOAP 1.1 has no complete\n(self contained) specification for its ``Fault`` element but requires\nexternally defined namespaces for completion and I have not yet\nunderstood the interaction between WSDL defined exceptions and\nSOAP ``Fault`` elements. Once, I have understood WSDL specified\nexceptions, this limitation might be removed.\n\nSOAP and WSDL are complex standards with a large number of features.\nThis package does not support all features. For example, it\nignores all SOAP headers, even headers with a ``must_understand``\ndeclaration (in violation of the SOAP specification).\nIn addition, only a small set of features has been tested:\nfor example, only the ``document`` binding; other bindungs might\n(or might not) work. Over time, more features might be supported,\nmight have been tested.\n\nThe current implementation makes use of ``suds`` WSDL caching. This\ncan be confusing during WSDL development, as modifications are not\nseen until the cache times out. Delete the ``suds`` cache files in such\na case (they usually are in a ``suds`` subfolder of the folder typically\nused for temporary files).\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nAs usual with ``dm.zope.rpc`` protocol handlers, configuration\nis via a marshaller instance.\nThe WSDL specific configuration of the  ``WsdlMarshaller`` is\nvia the fields ``wsdl_map`` and ``default_namespace``.\n``wsdl_map`` maps the namespace found in a method invocation to\nan url which provides access to the WSDL for this namespace.\n``default_namespace`` is the namespace to be used for GET requests\nwhen method and parameters are specified directly in the url and\nnot via a request entity.\n\nYou can find a (simple) example configuration in ``tests.soap``.\n\n\nMisc\n====\n\nThe package has been tested under Zope 2.12 and Zope 2.10.\nFor Zope versions before 2.12, a properly configured\n``dm.zopepatches.xmlrpc`` is required, to prevent Zope's\nbuiltin xmlrpc support to interfere.

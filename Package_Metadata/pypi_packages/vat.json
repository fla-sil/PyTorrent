However, from a\nbusiness\u2019 perspective, it is not; unlike a sales tax, businesses charge VAT to\n*everybody*, whether or not they are a business customer, and are able to\noffset the VAT they have to pay over to the tax authority against the VAT they\nhave themselves paid.\n\nSounds simple?  Hah!  You have *no* idea.\n\nThe first problem is that all of the different countries have their own rates\nfor VAT, and most of them have at least two rates that apply to different\ncategories of goods and services.  The second problem is cross-border\ntransactions; depending on the nature of the transaction, the supplier may or\nmay not be expected to charge VAT to the purchaser, and when they do not, the\npurchaser will generally be expected to account for VAT under the \u201creverse\ncharge\u201d rules (essentially by charging himself VAT, which will normally result\nin no payment to the tax authority because the amount to be paid will be\noffset entirely by itself).\n\nThere are all kinds of additional complications---some member states operate\nregistration thresholds, others don\u2019t; some provide a grace period for\nregistration, in others you\u2019ve broken the law if you make a supply that takes\nyou over the threshold; some allow you to register and submit returns\nyourself, others require that you hire people to do it for you; and so on.\n\nOne further niggle is that **suppliers of electronic services outside of the\nEuropean Union are expected to charge VAT to their European customers**.

In other words, Engineer let's you build a website from a bunch\r\nof files - articles written in Markdown, templates, and other stuff - and outputs *another* bunch of files - HTML,\r\nmostly - that you can then copy wherever you want.\r\n\r\nBut Engineer has some pretty nifty features that you might find enticing. You can read more about the project at\r\nhttp://engineer.readthedocs.org/ or grab the code at http://github.com/tylerbutler/engineer.\r\n\r\nLicensed under the MIT license.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nA full installation guide is available at https://engineer.readthedocs.org/en/master/installation.html. If you're in a\r\nhurry, though, you can install the most recent version of Engineer using pip. Simply run the following command:\r\n\r\n    pip install engineer\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n**Write posts from anywhere**\r\n\r\nPosts can be written/edited in Markdown and stored/synchronized using Dropbox or another file synchronization\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n**Preview your site locally**\r\n\r\nEngineer includes a small development web server that you can use to preview your site locally without deploying\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n**Manage your site remotely**\r\n\r\nEven baked sites need a little management, and many existing static generators require you to load up the\r\nterminal and execute a command to rebuild your site. Engineer lets you do that, of course,\r\nbut also provides Emma, a built-in mini management site (optional) that lets you\r\ndo most of the common management tasks remotely.\r\n\r\n**Themes make it easy to change your site's appearance**\r\n\r\nThemes provide flexibility in the site look and feel without starting from scratch or rewriting a bunch of\r\ncontent. You can write your own themes as well.\r\n\r\n**Use LESS instead of CSS**\r\n\r\nEngineer lets you use LESS instead of CSS if you'd like. LESS can either be preprocessed on the server (requires\r\nthat `lessc` be installed on non-Windows systems) or processed client-side using less.js.\r\n\r\n**It's fast**\r\n\r\nEngineer outputs content quickly (and I'm working to make it *even faster*), and because the output content is\r\ncompletely static, it is blazingly fast to serve, scales up very well, and is completely independent of any\r\nspecific web server or technology. Once generated, you can copy your site *anywhere* and use any web server you\r\nlike. In addition, Engineer can optimize your JavaScript and CSS/LESS to minimize their size. Engineer is all\r\nabout speed.\r\n\r\nCaveats\r\n-------\r\n\r\nDespite all of these great features, there are some things that you might *not* like:\r\n\r\n**No built-in search**\r\n\r\nSearch isn't built in. You can configure Google site search or something, but it's not baked into Engineer. But...\r\ndo people really use anything besides Google/Bing to find stuff anyway?\r\n\r\n**Dynamic things require a bit more work**\r\n\r\nStatic sites can feel limited if you're accustomed to doing something super-dynamic every time a page is loaded.\r\nMost of these things can be handled using either client-side JavaScript (e.g. timeago.js) or clever uses of\r\nthe Jinja 2 template system (see the navigation highlighting functionality in Engineer itself for an example of\r\nthings that can be done).\r\n\r\n**Might not fit your site's needs**\r\n\r\nIf you have a lot of one-off pages (template pages or other such things) then managing them can get a bit\r\ncumbersome. Engineer really excels when a majority of your site's content has a similar look and feel and you can\r\nleverage the post metadata for a majority of your content. Engineer isn't limited to blogs, per se,\r\nbut it does make some assumptions that most of your content comes in the form of articles.\r\n\r\n**Only supports Markdown and Jinja 2**\r\n\r\nWhile ideally this will not always be true, currently Engineer requires your posts be written in Markdown and any\r\ntemplates you create be written in Jinja 2. This may change in the future, but for now you have to use those\r\ntwo languages.\r\n\r\n**Engineer is not a CMS**\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a full-blown content management system, then... keep looking. Engineer is decidedly not what\r\nyou want. Engineer operates on the basic principle that your content is stored in text files with minimal\r\nmetadata in the files themselves, so if you're looking for rich URL management, image/file manipulation\r\ncapabilities, etc., Engineer will make you very sad. It's not designed to do that stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/tylerbutler/engineer", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "engineer", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/engineer/", "platform": "any", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/engineer/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://github.com/tylerbutler/engineer"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/engineer/0.5.2/", "requires_dist": ["appdirs (==1.4.3)", "bottle (==0.12.13)", "brownie (==0.5.1)", "cssmin (==0.2.0)", "feedgenerator (==1.9)", "flufl.enum (==4.1.1)", "html5lib (==0.90)", "humanize (==0.5.1)", "Jinja2 (==2.9.6)", "lpjsmin (==0.5)", "markdown (==2.6.8)", "path.py (<10.0,>=9.0)", "propane (>=0.2.1)", "pygments (==2.2.0)", "python-dateutil (==2.6.0)", "pytz (>=2017.2)", "pyYAML (==3.12)", "times (==0.6.2)", "translitcodec (==0.4.0)", "typogrify-engineer (>=2.0.0)", "argh; extra == 'dev'", "clint; extra == 'dev'"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "A static website generator.", "version": "0.5.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>At its core, Engineer is a static website generator.

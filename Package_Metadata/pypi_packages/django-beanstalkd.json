Server connections etc. all take\nplace in django-beanstalkd and don't unnecessarily clog your application code.\n\nThis library is based in large part on Fred Wenzel's [django-gearman][django-gearman].\nIf you're looking for synchronous execution of jobs, check out [Gearman][gearman]\nand Fred's library! Beanstalkd is useful for background processes only.\n\n[beanstalkd]: http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/\n[beanstalkc]: http://github.com/earl/beanstalkc/\n[gearman]: http://gearman.org/\n[django-gearman]: http://github.com/fwenzel/django-gearman\n\nInstallation\n------------\nIt's the same for both the client and worker instances of your django project:\n\n    pip install django-beanstalkd\n\nAdd ``django_beanstalkd`` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` section of `settings.py`.\n\nSpecify the following settings in your local settings.py file if your beanstalkd\nserver isn't accessible on port 11300 of localhost (127.0.0.1):\n\n    # My beanstalkd server\n    BEANSTALK_SERVER = '127.0.0.1:11300'  # the default value\n\nIf necessary, you can specify a pattern to be applied to your beanstalk worker\nfunctions:\n\n    # beanstalk job name pattern. Namespacing etc goes here. This is the pattern\n    # your jobs will register as with the server, and that you'll need to use\n    # when calling them from a non-django-beanstalkd client.\n    # replacement patterns are:\n    # %(app)s : django app name the job is filed under\n    # %(job)s : job name\n    BEANSTALK_JOB_NAME = '%(app)s.%(job)s'\n\n\nWorkers\n-------\n### Registering jobs\nCreate a file `beanstalk_jobs.py` in any of your django apps, and define as many\njobs as functions as you like. The job must accept a single string argument as\npassed by the caller.\n\nMark each of these functions as beanstalk jobs by decorating them with\n`django_beanstalkd.beanstalk_job`.\n\nFor an example, look at the `beanstalk_example` app's `benstalk_jobs.py` file.\n\n### Starting a worker\nTo start a worker, run `python manage.py beanstalk_worker`. It will start\nserving all registered jobs.\n\nTo spawn more than one worker (if, e.g., most of your jobs are I/O bound),\nuse the `-w` option:\n\n    python manage.py beanstalk_worker -w 5\n\nwill start five workers.\n\nSince the process will keep running while waiting for and executing jobs,\nyou probably want to run this in a _screen_ session or similar.\n\nClients\n-------\nTo make your workers work, you need a client app passing data to them. Create\nand instance of the `django_beanstalkd.BeanstalkClient` class and `call` a\nfunction with it:\n\n    from django_beanstalkd import BeanstalkClient\n    client = BeanstalkClient()\n    client.call('beanstalk_example.background_counting', '5')\n\nFor a live example look at the `beanstalk_example` app, in the\n`management/commands/beanstalk_example_client.py` file. Arguments to `call` are\n\n    priority: an integer number that specifies the priority. Jobs with a\n              smaller priority get executed first\n    delay:    how many seconds to wait before the job can be reserved\n    ttr:      how many seconds a worker has to process the job before it gets requeued\n\n\nExample App\n-----------\nFor a full, working, example application, add `beanstalk_example` to your\n`INSTALLED_APPS`, then run a worker in one shell:\n\n    python manage.py beanstalk_worker -w 4\n\nand execute the example app in another:\n\n    python manage.py beanstalk_example_client\n\nYou can see the client sending data and the worker(s) working on it.\n\nLicensing\n---------\nThis software is licensed under the [Mozilla Tri-License][MPL]:\n\n    ***** BEGIN LICENSE BLOCK *****\n    Version: MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1\n\n    The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License Version\n    1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with\n    the License.

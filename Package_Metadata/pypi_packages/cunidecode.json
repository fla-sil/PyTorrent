For example when integrating with legacy code that\ndoesn't support Unicode, or for ease of entry of non-Roman names on a US\nkeyboard, or when constructing ASCII machine identifiers from\nhuman-readable Unicode strings that should still be somewhat intelligible\n(a popular example of this is when making an URL slug from an article\ntitle). \n\nIn most of these examples you could represent Unicode characters as\n\"???\" or \"\\\\15BA\\\\15A0\\\\1610\", to mention two extreme cases. But that's\nnearly useless to someone who actually wants to read what the text says.\n\nWhat Unidecode provides is a middle road: function unidecode() takes\nUnicode data and tries to represent it in ASCII characters (i.e., the\nuniversally displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F), where the\ncompromises taken when mapping between two character sets are chosen to be\nnear what a human with a US keyboard would choose.\n\nThe quality of resulting ASCII representation varies. For languages of\nwestern origin it should be between perfect and good. On the other hand\ntransliteration (i.e., conveying, in Roman letters, the pronunciation\nexpressed by the text in some other writing system) of languages like\nChinese, Japanese or Korean is a very complex issue and this library does\nnot even attempt to address it. It draws the line at context-free\ncharacter-by-character mapping. So a good rule of thumb is that the further\nthe script you are transliterating is from Latin alphabet, the worse the\ntransliteration will be.\n\nNote that this module generally produces better results than simply\nstripping accents from characters (which can be done in Python with\nbuilt-in functions).

For example, if you have multiple checks within a single job but you wish to expose each of those steps as separate checks in github, you can use this tool to expose those extra steps.\n\ncistatus can dig relevant information from the enviroment variables exposed by most ci systems. Currently supported:\n\n * Azure Devops\n * Travis\n * CircleCI\n * AppVeyor\n * Shippable\n * CodeBuild\n\nThis means that if cistatus is executed within build nodes of any of these systems,  repository, pr and sha information is read from the environment variables.\n\n# Why\n\nUse-case for writing this came out of frustration to expose multiple test reports into a github pull request itself from Azure DevOps pipeline builds. With cistatus, one could now have a overall status check exposed in the pull request - if needed - and then add additional checks that each can link into a specific result set without the need to go dig deep in the build artifacts or build logs.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n```\npip install cistatus\n```\n\nIntegration\n===========\n\ncistatus has functionality to automatically detect the CI system that it's running on. This happens by checking of 'unique' environment variable of the said ci system and this requires no configuration from the user.\n\nWhen CI system is detected, a commit sha, repository name and pr values are read off from corresponding environment variables of said ci environment. Eg, if you want to run cistatus from your local shell,  only then you are required to pass in all mandatory command line arguments.\n\nWith this approach, when running the script from within any ci slave,  you only need to pass in the status flag to set the checks' status.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n```\n[-h] [--repo REPO] [--sha SHA] [--pr PR] [--token TOKEN]\n--status {pending,success,error,failure} [--url URL]\n[--description DESCRIPTION] [--context CONTEXT]\n\nSet Build Status\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --repo REPO           user/repo\n  --sha SHA\n  --pr PR\n  --token TOKEN         Github API Token\n  --status {pending,success,error,failure}\n  --url URL             Job url\n  --description DESCRIPTION\n                        Job Description\n  --context CONTEXT     Job context\n```\n\n## --repo\nThis flag sets the github repository where the status of the pr should be set at. If cistatus detects that its running in any of the supported environments,\nthis parameter is mandatory as value is read from appropriate environment file but it can still be overwritten from the command line.\n\n\n## --sha\nThis flag sets the the commit sha of the pr request. If cistatus detects that its running in any of the supported environments,\nthis parameter is mandatory as value is read from appropriate environment file but it can still be overwritten from the command line.\n\n## --pr\nThis flag sets the pull requests number where status is set. If cistatus detects that its running in any of the supported environments,\nthis parameter is mandatory as value is read from appropriate environment file but it can still be overwritten from the command line.\n\n## --token\nThis flag sets the personal authentication token. Value can be also set into `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable which is adviced if you do not want to leak the token into possibly public build logs.\n\n## --context\n\nThis flag sets the string shown as context of the check. Defaults to `default`\n\n## --description\n\nThis flag sets the longder description of the context.

I would like to hear from\nanyone who can help with porting.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n--------------------\n\n    *   Python 3\n    *   Gtk\n    *   Python Gtk+ bindings 3.4.2\n\nInstallation (Linux):\n---------------------\n\n    1.  Unzip the tar.gz somewhere.\n\n    2.  In a console window navigate to the UXBgtk-1.1 directory and run the\n        following command as root (on Ubuntu/Debian use sudo):\n\n            ``[sudo] python3 setup.py install``\n\n    3.  On Ubuntu a desktop launcher is installed, which you should be able to\n        find in the Dash and drag to the launcher bar.\n\nDesign Notes and Plans\n======================\n\nIt took me a while to get to grips with Gtk+, but here it is.\n\nThis version of the game includes a periodic boundary option. Hopefully it is \nfairly obvious from the button icons, but in any case some tinkering as you \nplay should help you work out what does what. Certainly, if you are feeling a \nlittle jaded with the 'normal' game, you will find periodic boundary conditions \nadd a little extra challenge...\n\nI found a bug in the introspected bindings, where the \n``Gtk.Grid.get_child_at()`` method is not mapped. I am assured this has been \nfixed in later versions of the bindings, and that the python3-gi package in \nUbuntu 12.10 will include the fix. Meanwhile, a workaround has been \nimplemented. It is planned to remove the workaround in later versions. \n\nPlease note, if you wish to use the workaround elsewhere, many of the methods \nneeded for a full workaround have not been implemented in my fix.\n\nAuthor:\n=======\n\nBob Bowles <bobjohnbowles@gmail.com>", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/UXBgtk", "keywords": "Mines", "license": "GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "UXBgtk", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/UXBgtk/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/UXBgtk/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/UXBgtk"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/UXBgtk/1.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A Gtk version of the Mines game intended for casual play.", "version": "1.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>An implementation of the well-known \u2018Mines\u2019 game in Python, using the Gtk+\ngraphics library.

Now i made the setup for this package to require PyCrypto and it should install regardless if not and you use a Debian/Ubuntu based system of linux just type::\n\n    sudo pip install pycrypto\n\nHow to Use\n==========\n\nTo use the module is very simple and i designed it for ease of use, I included a pretty detailed sample bot in the project itself in the sample directory of the package.\n\nBelow you'll find the class variable and function listing along with their descriptions.\n\nClass Details\n-------------\n\nFirst is the bots class::\n\n    bots.getbotbyserver(server) # Returns either the bot class of the server searched for, or returns False if not found\n    bots.makebot(server, port, username, realname=\"\", ssl=False, events=None, verbose=False) # Creates a bot with the given arguments, all variables with definitions already are optional.\n\n\nNow, to detail the variables contained within the bot class::\n\n    bot.server # The server name given to the bot. (string)\n    bot.port # Port number given to the bot. (integer)\n    bot.username # Username given to the bot. (string)\n    bot.realname # Real name given to the bot. (string)\n    bot.ssl # Whether or not to use ssl. (boolean)\n    bot.verbose # Whether or not to print all incoming and outdoing data. (boolean)\n    bot.protocol # Contains various IRC protocol functions to make life easier and less annoying :P (class)\n    # The following are the various functions in the bot class.\n    bot.encrypt(key, input) # Encrypts messages to FiSH encryption using a given FiSH key. (This is tested and working successfully on a multi-channel multi-key bot i made.)\n    bot.decrypt(key, input) # Decrypts messages from FiSH encryption using a given FiSH key.(FiSH portion of this confirmed to work.) This also has untested Mircryption support, i have not had the chance to test it as i hate mIRC, XChat for life.\n    bot.connect() # Starts the connection process.\n    bot.disconnect() # Kills the socket and null's the variable it was in and forces the thread running to stop.\n    \nThe protocol class has a few functions in it that would be helpful, they are listed below::\n\n    bot.protocol.joinChannel(channel) # Joins the given channel.\n    bot.protocol.leaveChannel(channel) # Leaves the given channel.\n    bot.protocol.quit([reason]) # Quits IRC, reason can be empty or given something to send.\n    bot.protocol.nsid(password) # Sends a message to nickserv identifying you using password given.\n    bot.protocol.nsreg(password, email) # Sends a message to nickserv to register the username the bot uses using the password and email provided.\n\nEvent Handler\n-------------\n\nTo use the raised events the bot is capable of raising at various times during its running you can either use a class with specficially named functions or a dictionary using specifically named key's with their partner function being the value.\n\nThe sample bot in the sample directory of this package uses the class handler, i find it a bit better than using just a dictionary, but the library supports either so have fun.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyIRCFiSH/", "keywords": null, "license": "LICENSE.txt", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "pyIRCFiSH", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyIRCFiSH/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyIRCFiSH/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyIRCFiSH/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyIRCFiSH/0.1.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Python implementation of the IRC with SSL and FiSH support.", "version": "0.1.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>pyIRC is a self contained class that is used to create irc bots, it supports both TLSv1 secured connection and FiSH chat encryption.

If you deal with location plotting or Magnetotelluric data, I suggest you check out their packages:\n\n[mtpy](https://github.com/MTgeophysics/mtpy)\n\n[cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/)\n\nMT-Explore also leverages numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and tk. \n\n## Installation\nBecause of the way things are, for version 0.0.4, you'll have to do a 2 part install, one with anaconda and one with pip.\nFirst, install cartopy using anaconda:\n```bash\nconda install cartopy\n```\n\nThen use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install MT-Explore.\n\n```bash\npip install mtexplore\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, create an Mt_Ex_Main Object and link it with your local .edi database directory.\n\n```python\nfrom mtexplore import Mt_Ex_Main\n\nmain_app = Mt_Ex_Main()\nmain_app.connect_database('MT Data/')\n\n```\n![Mt-Explore](https://github.com/El-minadero/mt-explore/blob/master/images/ex.png)\n\nYou should see a window pop up with a map view and associated phase/apparent resistivity plot. It is possible to interact with the data using the mouse or specific keys. For a full list of commands press 'h'\n\nMt Explore is meant to help identify stations with strategic location and data quality importance to your study area. Ultimately, stations are either included, or excluded from the dataset. To include stations, press 'i'. Similarly stations are excluded by pressing 'o'. \n\nThe include/exclude metadata is exported as a pandas dataframe via the load-save commands in .csv format for later data manipulation. This exported dataframe does not contain the transfer function information from the .edi files, but only the location on disk for each station. \n\n## Known Issues\nThere are a few cosmetic issues that I probably wont fix as they dont impact the usability of MT-Explore. However, if you know how to fix them feel free to submit a pull request.\n\nBy overriding some of the key bindings of Matplotlib, a few unexpected plot and map behaviors were introduced. If things mess up just kill the plot window and instantiate the Main object again. \n\ntick locators are temporarily broken. this shouldn't impact usability however.\n\n## Contributing\nPull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.\n\nPlease make sure to update tests as appropriate.\n\n## License\n[GNU GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)\n\n## Attribution\n\nIf you use this package, please cite [mtpy](https://github.com/MTgeophysics/mtpy) and [cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/).

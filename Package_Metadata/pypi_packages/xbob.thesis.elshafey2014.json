CohortLDA) algorithm.\nFor these algorithms, optional wrapper classes are provided in the xfacereclib.extension.CSU_ satellite package.\nBy default, this package is disabled.\nTo enable them, please call::\n\n  $ bin/buildout -c buildout-with-csu.cfg\n\nafter downloading and patching the CSU resources, and updating the ``sources-dir`` in the **buildout-with-csu.cfg** file -- as explained in xfacereclib.extension.CSU_.\n\n\nDatabases\n.........\n\nExperiments are conducted on several databases.\nThey should be downloaded and extracted manually to be able to reproduce the plots.\n\n- BANCA [http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/banca]\n- AR face database [http://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/~aleix/ARdatabase.html]\n- Face Recognition Grand Challenge version 2 [http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/frgc.cfm]\n- The Good, The Bad and the Ugly [http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/focs.cfm]\n- Labeled Faces in the Wild [http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw] (images aligned with funneling [http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw-funneled.tgz] and annotations [http://www.idiap.ch/resource/biometric/data/LFW-Annotations.tar.gz])\n- Multi-PIE [http://www.multipie.org]\n- MOBIO  [http://www.idiap.ch/dataset/mobio] (images, audio data and image annotations)\n- CAS-PEAL [http://www.jdl.ac.cn/peal/index.html]\n- NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation 2012 [http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/sre12.cfm] (Additional data distributed by `LDC <https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/>`_ are required for training and development purposes [see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xbob.db.nist_sre12 to preprocess the data])\n\nOnce you have installed the databases, you should set the path to raw data into some configuration files.\nFor instance, for running experiments on the BANCA database, you should set the variable 'banca_directory'\nin the file `banca.py <file:xbob/thesis/elshafey2014/databases/banca.py>`_ to your directory that \ncontains the images of this database.\nThis is explained in more details in the complete documentation.\n\n\nRunning experiments\n-------------------\n\nIf you have set up everything mentioned above, you are ready to run the recognition experiments.\n\nThis process is split into two different steps::\n\n   1. Generation of raw scores from raw data (image/audio files [and possibly annotations]) of the databases\n\n   2. Generation of plots from these raw scores\n\nThere is a single exception with the plots generated on the M-iris synthetic dataset.\nIn this case, the experiments does not require any external data and can be reproduced in one step.\nIn practice, the first step has high computational requirements, which depend on the database considered.\n\n\nRead further\n------------\n\nThere are several file links in the documentation, which won't work in the online documentation.\nTo generate the documentation locally, type::\n\n  $ bin/sphinx-build docs sphinx\n  $ firefox sphinx/index.html\n\nand read further instructions on how to use this package.\n\n\nCite our paper\n--------------\n\nIf you use this package in any of your experiments, please cite the following paper::\n\n

You can run it with python3 on a CSV file and start using it, ex:\n\n```\npython3 Clark_Sheets.py some_file.csv\n```\n\n2. You can also pass in a series of commands as extra arguments and the program will open the file passed in, execute the passed in commands, save the data, and exit\n\n```\npython3 Clark_Sheets.py some_file.csv command1 command2\n```\n[key_mappings.py](https://github.com/rssys/linux-sheet/blob/master/key_mappings.py) has all the key mappings for the commands, you just have to send those in. Currently the program can only insert and delete rows and cols.\n\n## Running the tests\n\nGo into [test_cases](https://github.com/rssys/linux-sheet/tree/master/test_cases) and each subdirectory to run each test case(I will make a bash script to run all of them at once soon)\n\n## Things I'd like to add\n\n* individual resizable columns\n* general resizable columns\n* perhaps multiple pads to increase the dimensions this program can handle (right now I am only using one pad and it's max dimensions seem to be 32768 rows by 702 cols)\n* when searching implement a next option to cycle through all matches\n* customizable key key_mappings\n* formulas\n* Better testing, as well as testing more features such as go_to, quick_scroll, things that don't impact the data but could cause crashes because they move off screen\n* when passing in extra commands, be able to write data\n\n## Contributing\n\nWill figure this one out after our meeting as I(Clark) am not the creator of this repo and am not aware of the permissions granted to contributors\n\n## Authors\n\nClark Chan\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/rssys/linux-sheet", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "ClarkSheets", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ClarkSheets/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ClarkSheets/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/rssys/linux-sheet"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ClarkSheets/1.1.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Shell based spreadsheet application", "version": "1.1.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Clark Sheets</h1>\n<p>Clark Sheets is a shell based spreadsheet application.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Supports 32768 rows and 702 columns</li>\n<li>Copy/Paste</li>\n<li>Quick scroll</li>\n<li>Go to any coordinates on the grid</li>\n<li>Undo/Redo</li>\n<li>Insert and Delete rows/columns</li>\n<li>Search</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Installing</h3>\n<p>install with pip</p>\n<pre><code>pip install ClarkSheets\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Using the Program</h3>\n<p>There are 2 ways to use the program:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can run it with python3 on a CSV file and start using it, ex:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>python3 Clark_Sheets.py some_file.csv\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>You can also pass in a series of commands as extra arguments and the program will open the file passed in, execute the passed in commands, save the data, and exit</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>python3 Clark_Sheets.py some_file.csv command1 command2\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rssys/linux-sheet/blob/master/key_mappings.py\" rel=\"nofollow\">key_mappings.py</a> has all the key mappings for the commands, you just have to send those in.

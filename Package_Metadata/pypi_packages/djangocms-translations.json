We'll be delighted to receive your\nfeedback in the form of issues and pull requests. Before submitting your\npull request, please review our `contribution guidelines\n<http://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/contributing/index.html>`_.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nSee ``REQUIREMENTS`` in the `setup.py <https://github.com/divio/djangocms-translations/blob/master/setup.py>`_\nfile for additional dependencies:\n\n* Python 2.7, 3.4 or higher\n* Django 1.11 or higher\n* django CMS 3.5 or higher\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nFor a manual install:\n\n* run ``pip install djangocms-translations``\n* add ``djangocms_translations`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``\n* run ``python manage.py migrate djangocms_translations``\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\n**When content is sent for translation, the source pages must not be edited\nuntil the translated content has been written back successfully.**\n\nThe translation system needs to find exactly the same plugins in the content\nas were there when the process was initiated. If any are missing, it will\ncause an error and require the process to be restarted.\n\n**This affects all plugins on a page** including text, images and other plugin types.\n\n**Any change to plugins on a source page while content is out for translation\ncan cause write-back failures.**\n\nSingle page translation\n#######################\n\nYou find the single page translation feature under Translation > Translate this page\nprovided that there is one or more language present to be translated to.\nThe language displayed in that step represent the current available and configured\nlanguages of the current site. Do not worry about this too much as you will be\nable to customise the selection in the next step:\n\n**Configuring the translation request**\nThe single translation request, unlike the bulk translation request, allows you\nto translate a single page from one source page to another across the multisite\nsetup. The following options are available:\n\n**Source CMS Page**\nThis is the source page you need to select. It is represented by the site\nfrom the multisite setup and the page that should be selected for translatation.\n\n**Source Language**\nThis step will always show the fully-configured languages available in the system.\nYou need to check in advance the page tree which page and language you would like to pick. This step can lead to errors if the source page is not configured, or has no content.\n\n**Target CMS Page**\nThis is the target page you need to select. The interface is the same as on the\nSource CMS Page. It is important that the targeted CMS Page is configured and\nhas no content. If the target page has already content, the new translated content\nwill be appended to the current one. The translation system will never replace/erase content.\n\n**Target Language**\nThis behaves the same as the Source Language. Also in this case, make sure that\nyou select the correct language from the target source. If it is another site\nyou need to check in advance that the language is available otherwise you will\nreceive an error.\n\n**Provider Backend**\nSelect the translation service. As of now only\n`Supertext <https://www.supertext.ch>`_ is supported.\n\nOnce the translation request has been sent, the Status, as described under\nOverview will apply. If there are issues you may want to check with the\ntranslation provider on their status.\n\nBulk translation\n################\n\nUnlike the single page translation feature, bulk translation only allows to\ntranslate on the current site you have selected. The following options are\navailable:\n\n**Source Language**\nSimilar to the single translation request you need to select a source language.\nNote that all configured language options in the systems will be shown, not just\nthe ones for the current site. So, you need to be aware of what languages the\ncurrent site has, and select the correct source language.\n\n**Target Language**\nSimilar to the single translation request; you need to select a target language.\nOnce again all configured language options in the systems are available, and you\nneed to be aware of what languages the current site has, and select the correct\nsource language. The target language needs also to be configured, otherwise the\nfull bulk translation will fail, even if just one page is not configured correctly.\n\n**Provider Backend**\nSame as for single translation requests.\n\nSettings\n########\n\nWith ``DJANGOCMS_TRANSLATIONS_CONF`` you can define what data should be\nsent from any given plugin to control unnecessary data isn't transferred::\n\n    DJANGOCMS_TRANSLATIONS_CONF = {\n        'TextPlugin': {'fields': ['body']},\n        'LinkPlugin': {'fields': ['name']},\n        'AudioFilePlugin': {'fields': ['text_title', 'text_description']},\n        'AudioFolderPlugin': {'fields': []},\n        'AudioTrackPlugin': {'fields': ['label']},\n        'AudioPlayerPlugin': {'fields': ['label']},\n        'FilePlugin': {'fields': ['link_title']},\n        'PicturePlugin': {'fields': ['caption_text']},\n        'VideoTrackPlugin': {'fields': ['label']},\n        'VideoSourcePlugin': {'fields': ['text_title', 'text_description']},\n        'VideoPlayerPlugin': {'fields': ['label']},\n    }\n\nWith ``DJANGOCMS_TRANSLATIONS_USE_STAGING`` set to ``True`` you can send the\ndata to a staging environment rather than live.\n\nWith ``DJANGOCMS_TRANSLATIONS_BULK_BATCH_SIZE`` you can define the batch size\nto be transmitted to the translation provider. The default is ``100``.\n\n\nRunning Tests\n-------------\n\nYou can run tests by executing::\n\n    virtualenv env\n    source env/bin/activate\n    pip install -r tests/requirements.txt\n    python setup.py test\n\n\n.. |pypi| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/djangocms-translations.svg\n    :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/djangocms-translations\n.. |build| image:: https://travis-ci.org/divio/djangocms-translations.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/divio/djangocms-translations\n.. |coverage| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/divio/djangocms-translations/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/divio/djangocms-translations\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/divio/djangocms-translations", "keywords": "", "license": "BSD", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "djangocms-translations", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/djangocms-translations/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/djangocms-translations/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/divio/djangocms-translations"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/djangocms-translations/1.4.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Send django CMS content for translation to 3rd party providers.", "version": "1.4.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p><a href=\"http://badge.fury.io/py/djangocms-translations\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"pypi\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/a53ab5d24b4889a1a7b3c8d9d276b215b0bb1bd9/68747470733a2f2f62616467652e667572792e696f2f70792f646a616e676f636d732d7472616e736c6174696f6e732e737667\"></a> <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/divio/djangocms-translations\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"build\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/bd4612e2937189e94fec9ec7ba116fdc07bf1ee2/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f646976696f2f646a616e676f636d732d7472616e736c6174696f6e732e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a> <a href=\"https://codecov.io/gh/divio/djangocms-translations\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"coverage\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/97b9304e170e54bbc3d1fa7c314659df87fc6c91/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f762e696f2f67682f646976696f2f646a616e676f636d732d7472616e736c6174696f6e732f6272616e63682f6d61737465722f67726170682f62616467652e737667\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>django CMS Translations</strong> enables content, created in django CMS, to be\ntransferred to an external translation tool, processed and send back.

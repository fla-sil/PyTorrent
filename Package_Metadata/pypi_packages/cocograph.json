Tilesets required by an existing map will \nbe loaded with the map. Click on a tile to select it for use with the \npencil tool. Click on a tileset name tab to use that tileset.\n\n\nCreating a New Map\n\nEnter the size of tiles and the map and submit, you can then save the \nmap and it will be loaded into Cocograph. You can then open an existing\ntileset from the tileset dialog menu or create a new one.\n\n\nCreating a New Tileset\n\nFrom Dir:\nSelect a directory containing images (.png, ,jpg, .bmp, .gif), you \ncan then save the tileset and it will be loaded into Cocograph. You\nwill probably want the images in the directory to be the same size.\n\nFrom Image:\nSelect and image, enter the tile size and if there's any padding\naround the tiles. You can then save the tileset and it will be loaded \ninto Cocograph.\n\n\nLayers\n\nThe 'op' slider adjusts the opacity of the currently selected layer.\n'+' adds a new layer.  Enter a layer ID, tile size, and Z origin\n(to determine the ordering of layers). '-' removes the currently \nselected layer. 'Properties' allows you to add / change properties\nfor the currently selected layer.\n\n\nTools\n\nTOOL    LEFT CLICK ACTION               RIGHT CLICK ACTION\npencil  draw selected tile from tileset select clicked map tile (picker)\npicker  select clicked map tile         select clicked map tile\neraser  set clicked map tile to None    set clicked map tile to None\nmove    click and drag around the map   click and drag around the map\nzoom    zoom in                         zoom out\n\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nKEY+MODIFIER                    ACTION\nctrl+click on tile or cell      edit properties\nspacebar down                   click and drag around the map (move)\nctrl+s                          save map\nctrl+=                          zoom in\nctrl+-                          zoom out\nmouse scroll wheel              zoom\nctrl+d                          debug info toggle\nctrl+q                          quit\nctrl+s                          save\n\nCommandline Usage: run_cocograph.py <level.xml> to open a level\nor simply run or double click run_cocograph.py and then open or create\na new map.\n\n\nLICENSE:\n\nCopyright (c) 2009, Devon Scott-Tunkin\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n      documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n    * Neither the name of the <organization> nor the\n      names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products\n      derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE AUTHOR ''AS IS'' AND ANY\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.

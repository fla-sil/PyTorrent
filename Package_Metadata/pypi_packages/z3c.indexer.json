This\nimplementation is different from zope.catalog and is an alternative to it.\n\n\n=======\nCHANGES\n=======\n\n0.6.1 (2012-11-17)\n------------------\n\n- Feature: implemented TextIndex with family64 BTree support which makes it\n  possible to use long as index ids. Added tests for the new TextIndex64.\n\n\n0.6.0 (2009-02-22)\n------------------\n\n- Feature: Add support for sorting by indexed values, introduced in\n  zope.index 3.5.0. See description of the ``searchResults`` method\n  of ISearchQuery.\n\n- Bugfix: Make query object constructor work with index name\n  passed as unicode as well as with str.\n\n- Mention ``searchResultFactory`` argument in the ``searchResults`` method\n  of the ISearchQuery interface.\n\n- Added the \"subscriber.zcml\" file that contains ZCML-based intid subscriber\n  registrations for easy including in projects that use event-based indexing.\n\n- The IIndexValue interface and all its mentions in code and documentation\n  is removed, because it's not an actual part of concept and wasn't ever\n  used/implemented in this package. It's easy to implement it in custom\n  project, so we believe that it's not a problem.\n\n- Reworded package description to make it nicer. Fix little docstring typos.\n\n- Use new lightweight and ZMI-less versions of packages: zope.keyreference,\n  zope.intid, zope.site, zope.container and zope.catalog (for tests).\n\n\n0.5.1 (2008-12-11)\n------------------\n\n- Bugfix: SearchQuery wasn't able to act correct if initialized with query=None\n  because of an empty result setup. The And() and Not() methods could not act\n  correctly with this an empty initilized result.\n\n- Bugfix: SearchQuery.And() and Not() didn't return an empty result if previous\n  or given query result was empty. The previous result was returned.\n\n- Feature: implemented new indexing strategy which uses transaction and thread\n  local for prevent to index an object more then once per transaction.\n\n- Bugfix: performance tests, not query did not show the right timer in catalog\n  cell.\n\n- Feature: added optional searchResultFactory. This class get used as a search\n  result wrapper. By default the ResultSet class get used.\n\n- Feature: Expose SearchQuery.results property. Ensure that we return always an\n  empty result if None is given and allow to override existing results as a\n  part of the SearchQuery API.\n\n- Feature: Implemented optional intids argument in SearchQuery.searchResults\n  method. This intids is used instead of query the IntIds util. This is usefull\n  if you use builtin IIntIds objects for optimized access.\n\n- Added __repr__ for ResultSet with result lenght.\n\n- Optimized SearchQuery.And() and Not() methods. Skip given query processing\n  if previous result is empty.\n\n- Code is now 100% covered by tests.\n\n\n0.5.0 (2008-05-02)\n------------------\n\n- Initial release", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.indexer", "keywords": "zope3 z3c catalog indexer index indexing", "license": "ZPL 2.1", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "z3c.indexer", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/z3c.indexer/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/z3c.indexer/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.indexer"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/z3c.indexer/0.6.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A new way to index objects for Zope3", "version": "0.6.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>This package provides a way to index objects and query indexes for Zope3.

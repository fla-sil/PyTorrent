Refactor legacy projects one route at a time; graft instead of rewrite.\n2. Try new ideas from meetups/conferences in isolation; increase velocity.\n3. Integrate multiple web frameworks; use the right tool for the job.\n\nwsgi_party is for WSGI framework developers. See individual frameworks and\nextensions for support. The initial intent was to build URLs across independent\napplications, but other exchanges are possible if they are supported by all\nframeworks in use.\n\nThe wsgi_party module provides the WSGIParty middleware which allows all\nmounted applications to hook in handlers for cross-application communication\nwithin a single WSGI process. Mount individual applications in a dispatcher,\nthen wrap the dispatcher with WSGIParty. Applications can then ask each other\nfor information with simple in-process messages. Messages are synchronous and\nnamespaced, and must be explicitly supported by Python web frameworks or their\nextensions.\n\nBSD licensed.

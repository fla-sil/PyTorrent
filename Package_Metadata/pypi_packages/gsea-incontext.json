For an experiment where less than seven samples per condition are compared, GSEA employs a competitive null hypothesis to test significance. A gene set enrichment score is tested against a null distribution of enrichment scores generated from permuted gene sets, where genes are randomly selected from the input experiment. Looking across a variety of biological conditions, however, genes are not randomly distributed with many showing consistent patterns of up- or down-regulation. As a result, common patterns of positively and negatively enriched gene sets are observed across experiments. Placing a single experiment into the context of a relevant set of background experiments allows us to identify both the common and experiment-specific patterns of gene set enrichment. We developed the GSEA-InContext method to allow a user to account for gene expression patterns within a defined background set of experiments to identify statistically significantly enriched gene sets in their own experiment.\n\nSee below for examples on running the GSEA-InContext algorithm.\n\nThis repo is a fork of [GSEApy](https://github.com/BioNinja/GSEApy) (original documentation [here](http://gseapy.rtfd.io/). We have added a new tool ``GSEA_InContext`` which runs the GSEAPreranked algorithm but uses a background set of ranked lists to calculate an empirical null distribution for informing the permutation procedure. For examples using the original GSEApy library, [visit this page](http://gseapy.readthedocs.io/en/master/gseapy_example.html).\n\n\nAbout GSEA-InContext\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrently, there are no methods available for a user to easily compare their GSEA results to GSEA results obtained in other experiments to discern similar and/or distinct patterns affected across experiments. GSEA-InContext accounts for gene-specific variation estimated from an experimental background. Whereas GSEA identifies all signiificantly enriched gene sets in an experiment, this method allows the user to ask a complementary question; namely, which gene sets are uniquely enriched in a single experiment compared to many other, independent experiments.\n\nOur method applies the same approach as GSEA to calculate the nominal p-value. However, in contrast to GSEAPreranked, GSEA-InContext employs an alternative significance testing procedure to generate the null distribution, in which permuted gene sets are generated using the density of gene ranks estimated from a set of user-defined background experiments. We estimate a gene's probability density using a Gaussian kernel over the experiments in the background set.\n\nThe GSEA-InContext algorithm can be run using the ``incontext`` subcommand. Additional subcommands can be run as in the original GSEApy, including: ``gsea``, ``prerank``, ``ssgsea``, ``replot`` ``enrichr``. See the original `GSEApy <https://github.com/BioNinja/GSEApy>`_ repository.\n\nThe full ``GSEA`` is described in:\n[GSEA](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) documentation. All file formats for GSEApy are identical to ``GSEA`` desktop version.\n\n\nData & Availability\n---------------------\n\nThe data, results and analysis described in [our preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/04/259440) are hosted in a Synapse project available [here](https://www.synapse.org/GSEA_InContext)(doi:10.7303/syn11804693).\n\n\nDependencies & Requirements\n--------------\n* Python 3.4+\n* Numpy >= 1.13.0\n* Pandas\n* Matplotlib\n* Beautifulsoup4\n* Requests (for enrichr API)\n\nYou may also need to install lxml and html5lib to parse xml files.\n\nRunning GSEApy and GSEA-InContext\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore you start:\n-----------------\n\nConvert all gene symbol names to uppercase. The ranked lists input to ``prerank`` or ``incontext`` can be supplied as file paths (.rnk) or a two-column Pandas DataFrame (columns ``gene_name`` and ``fold_change``). The background ranked lists input to ``incontext`` is supplied as a text file containing the list of .rnk files to use in permutation, or as a .csv file containing pre-permuted gene lists created with the ``make_background_dist()`` function.\n\n\nRun GSEAPY inside Python console:\n------------------\n\n| Running GSEAPreranked and GSEA-InContext in Python using file paths as input\n\n```\n\n    import gseapy\n\n    # Run GSEA Prerank\n    gseapy.prerank(rnk='gsea_data.rnk', gene_sets='gene_sets.gmt', outdir='out')\n\n    # Run GSEA-InContext\n    gseapy.incontext(rnk='gsea_data.rnk', gene_sets='gene_sets.gmt', backround_rnks = 'permuted_background.csv', outdir='out')\n```\n\nA full example can be seen in ``run_example.py``.

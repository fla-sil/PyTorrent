However, it is impossible to use\nit with certificates provided as a string. We store certificates in database,\nbecause we handle different apps on many Celery worker machines.

Thanks Jason Spafford, zhe li and neetu jain.\n*v0.1*\n    Forked from apns-client and fixed SSL handshake error caused by Apple's SSLv3 deprecation\n\n\nAlternatives\n------------\n\nThere are `many alternatives <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=apns&submit=search>`_ available.\nThis library differs in the following design decisions:\n\n- *Support certificates from strings*. We do not distribute certificate files\n  on worker machines, they fetch it from the database when needed. This\n  approach simplifies deployment, upgrades and maintenance.\n- *Keep connections persistent*. An SSL handshaking round is slow. Once\n  connection is established, it should remain open for at least few minutes,\n  waiting for the next batch.\n- *Support enhanced format*. Apple developers have designed a notoriously bad\n  push protocol. They have upgraded it to enhanced version, which makes it\n  possible to detect which messages in the batch have failed.\n- *Clean pythonic API*. No need for lots of classes, long lists of exceptions etc.\n- *Do not hard-code validation, let APNs fail*. This decision makes library\n  a little bit more future proof.\n\n\nTodo\n----\n\n- *[TODO] own documentation for apns-clerk*\n- *[TODO] proper attributions for previous work*", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": null, "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://bitbucket.org/aleksihoffman/apns-clerk", "keywords": "apns push notification apple messaging iOS", "license": "Apache 2.0", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "apns-clerk", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/apns-clerk/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/apns-clerk/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://bitbucket.org/aleksihoffman/apns-clerk"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/apns-clerk/0.2.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Python client for Apple Push Notification service (APNs)", "version": "0.2.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>Python client for <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/ApplePushService.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple Push Notification service (APNs)</a>.</p>\n<p>This project is forked from apns-client, as there was a tiny but severe problem with SSL handshake rendering the package to be unusable.\nFor the time being please check for apns-client\u2019s <a href=\"http://apns-client.readthedocs.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">documentation</a> .</p>\n<div id=\"requirements\">\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six/\" rel=\"nofollow\">six</a> - Python 2 and 3 compatibility library.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyOpenSSL/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pyOpenSSL</a> - OpenSSL wrapper.

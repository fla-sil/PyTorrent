Tooltool is a program that helps make downloading large\nbinaries easier in a CI environment.  The program creates a json based manifest\nthat is small compared to the binaries.  That manifest is transmitted to the\nmachine that needs the binary somehow (checked in, included in tarball, etc)\nwhere the machine will run tooltool to download.\n\nWhen using the fetch mode, the program will check to see if the file exists\nlocally.  If this file does not exist locally the program will try to fetch\nfrom one of the base URLs provided.  The API that tooltool uses to fetch files\nis exceedingly simple.  the API is that each file request will look for an http\nresource that is a combination of an arbitrary base url, a directory that is\nnamed as the hashing algorithm used and the hashing results of each file stored.\n\nExample, using base url of \"http://localhost:8080/tooltool\", algorithm of \"sha512\"\nand a file that hashes to \"abcedf0123456789\", tooltool would look for the file\nat \"http://localhost:8080/tooltool/sha512/abcdef0123456789\".

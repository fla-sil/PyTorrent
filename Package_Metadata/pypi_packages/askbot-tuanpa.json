If any of these cause issues - please do not hesitate to contact admin@askbot.org.\n\nAskbot patches `auth_user` table. The migration script will automatically add missing columns, however it will not overwrite any existing columns.

If you have these apps on your site, you may have trouble installing askbot.\n\nUser registration and login system is bundled with Askbot. It is quite good though, it allows logging in with password and many authentication service providers, including popular social services and recover account by email.\n\nIf there are any other collisions, askbot will simply fail to install, it will not damage your data.\n\nBackground Information\n======================\nAskbot is based on CNPROG project by Mike Chen and Sailing Cai, project which was originally inspired by StackOverflow and Yahoo Answers.\n\nFootnotes\n=========\n(*) - If you want to install with django 1.2.x a dependency \"Coffin-0.3\" needs to be replaced with \"Coffin-0.3.3\" - this will be automated in the future versions of the setup script.\n\n(**) - With MySQL you have to use MyISAM data backend, because it's the only one that supports Full Text Search.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/", "keywords": "forum,community,wiki,Q&A", "license": "GPLv3", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "askbot-tuanpa", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/askbot-tuanpa/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/askbot-tuanpa/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/askbot-tuanpa/0.7.48/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Question and Answer forum, like StackOverflow, written in python and Django", "version": "0.7.48", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>Askbot will work alone or with other django apps (with some limitations, please see below), Django 1.1.1 - 1.2.3(*), MySQL(**) and PostgresQL(recommended) (&gt;=8.3).</p>\n<p>Questions?

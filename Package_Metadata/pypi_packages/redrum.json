It remembers which wallpapers were selected previously so you never see the same image twice.\n\nInstall the systemd units to run the script every two hours.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n1. Install through pip\n\n   .. code:: bash\n\n      pip3 install redrum\n\n2. Edit ``~/.config/redrum.ini`` with your preferred options.\n  \n3. Install service for automatic wallpaper changing (optional)\n\n   .. code:: bash\n\n      # copy service files\n      cp -u systemd/* ~/.config/systemd/user/\n\n      # enable and start systemd timer\n      systemctl --user enable redrum.timer\n      systemctl --user start redrum.timer\n\n      # the service can be triggered manually as well\n      systemctl --user start redrum\n\n\n   note: If using a python3 virtualenv, change ``ExecStart`` in ``redrum.service`` to ``/path/to/venv/bin/redrum``\n  \nUsage\n-----\n\nIf redrum can't find a config file, it will create one in ``~/.config/redrum.ini`` automatically.  You should update this file with your screen resolution and preferred subreddits, then run redrum again.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   >>> redrum\n   No config found at /home/evan/.config/redrum.ini.  Creating...\n   Update config with your preferred options and run redrum again.\n\n   >>> redrum\n   No previous score cache found at /home/evan/.cache/redrum_cache.json.\n   Indexing page #0 from subreddit winterporn\n   Indexing page #1 from subreddit winterporn\n   Indexing page #2 from subreddit winterporn\n   ...\n   Selected http://i.imgur.com/3UWbcYG.jpg (EarthPorn) with score 5.21729920261845e-05 out of 5971 images\n   The probability of selecting this image was 0.009851421028579594\n   Applying wallpaper\n\nScoring algorithm\n-----------------\n\nImages are scored in three steps as follows:\n\n1. Three input scores are calculated for each image in the cache\n\n   .. math::\n\n      pixel_score = [total image pixels] / [total screen pixels]\n   \n      ratio_score = [image x-y ratio] / [screen x-y ratio]\n                                    or\n                    [screen x-y ratio] / [image x-y ratio]\n                            (whichever is less than 1)\n                         \n      views_score = [# views of this image] / [highest # views of all images]\n   \n2. Each input score is run through a sigmoid function, in this case, the `logistic function`_.  This helps to provide stronger differentiation between a good and a bad image than could be afforded with a linear method.  The logistic function is defined by its ``midpoint`` and the slope at the midpoint, ``k``. \n\n   .. image:: https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2770ecdecd1a6d2375d17f73013905cea5fb2668\n   .. figure:: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Logistic-curve.svg\n      :width: 400px\n   \n      Logistic function with ``midpoint=0``, ``k=1``\n\n\n      In `redrum` the logistic function has been normalized such that f(0) = 1.\n   .. math::\n\n      ratio_logistic_score = (1 + pow(math.e, -ratio_k * (1 - ratio_off)))/(1 + pow(math.e, -ratio_k * (ratio_score - ratio_cutoff)))\n      views_logistic_score = (1 + pow(math.e, -ratio_k * (1 - ratio_off)))/(1 + pow(math.e, -views_k * (views_score - views_cutoff)))\n      pixel_logistic_score = (1 + pow(math.e, -ratio_k * (1 - ratio_off)))/(1 + pow(math.e, -pixel_k * (pixel_score - pixel_cutoff)))\n   \n   ``pixel_score``, ``ratio_score``, and ``views_score`` each have their own ``midpoint`` and ``k``, which can be set in ``~/.config/redrum.ini``\n\n   .. _logistic function: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function\n   \n3. The three logistic scores are then multiplied to calculate an image's ``final_score``.  This score is used to do a random weighted select of all images in the cache.  An image with a ``final_score`` that is twice the score of another image is twice as likely to be selected during the random selection.\n\nTuning the scoring algorithm\n----------------------------\nYou can adjust the scoring algorithm if you aren't satisfied with the images being selected.  ``redrum_tune`` allows you to quickly adjust the ``midpoint`` and ``k`` of the logarithmic function and view its effects on the ``final_score``.  You need to run ``pip install redrum[tune]`` to install the extra dependencies (matplotlib, numpy).", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/evidlo/redrum", "keywords": "Reddit wallpaper changer", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "redrum", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/redrum/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/redrum/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/evidlo/redrum"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/redrum/1.5.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "uses math to select wallpapers from Reddit", "version": "1.5.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            Redrum - Reddit Wallpaper Downloader and Ranker<br>==============================================<br><br>.. image:: screenshot.png<br><br>Redrum is a Reddit wallpaper downloader which scores wallpapers and selects the best based on resolution, aspect ratio, and number of views.

In addition to having it's own schemata, our two word schemata\r\nfields\r\n  also appear in a separate fieldset on the default page.  I didn't have time to\r\ninvestigate\r\n  the root cause and Google didn't turn up results, so we take this workaround of a \r\n  renamed schema [andrewb]\r\n\r\n- Utilizing Plone 3.x viewlet managers for control of template elements like:\r\ndocument\r\n  actions, above content body items, etc.  If the ecardcollection_view is\r\ncustomized \r\n  and you're upgrading eCards, see the following changeset for what should be merged\r\n  within your custom template:\r\n  http://dev.plone.org/collective/changeset/75433 [andrewb]\r\n\r\n- Pulling as much installation boilerplate and cruft out of Extension/Install.py and\r\n  into Generic Setup profiles as is currently feasible. Still maintain an Install \r\n  module with uninstall method because as of CMFQI version 2.1.6 we don't have a \r\n  convention for looking for an appropriate uninstall profile and InstalledProduct \r\n  instances don't fully clean-up like we want [andrewb]\r\n\r\n- In previous releases of eCards we were essentially hand rolling the necessary\r\nblock\r\n  of text required to send an HTML email.  Because this is a profoundly bad idea\r\nand \r\n  quite fragile, the structuring of the emailing is now done in a helper method\r\nwithin\r\n  browser.py utilizing Python's email message module.  The aim is to let \r\n  people freely customize \"email_template.pt\" within the ecards_template\r\n  skin folder.  This should be pretty future proof.  Because branding of the\r\nfull eCard\r\n  experience is pretty important, if you also needed to customize send_ecard.cpy, \r\n  you may need to merge your modifications with the updated code base.  See the\r\nfollowing \r\n  changeset for help: http://dev.plone.org/collective/changeset/75168 \r\n  [andrewb, thanks to mborch & collective.singing for inspiration]\r\n\r\n- Updates to ecardpopup_view.pt and ecardpopup_thanks.pt. Bringing in line with\r\nthe plone.htmlhead\r\n  viewlet.  Again, because customization of skin layers is pretty critical and\r\nit's quite likely\r\n  that the ecardpopup_view.pt and ecardpopup_thanks.pt were customized if you're \r\n  upgrading to eCards 1.1, you'll want to merge the following changes into your \r\n  customizations: http://dev.plone.org/collective/changeset/75162\r\n  Please keep in mind that old versions of these templates no longer work with \r\n  Plone 3.x because of the lack of a header.pt within the skin layer [andrewb]\r\n\r\n- Code updates and refactoring for Plone 3.x compliance.  Plone 2.5.x no longer\r\nactively\r\n   maintained, though patches that maintain compatibility in both releases\r\nhappily accepted.\r\n   Thanks to mborch for all initial work [andrewb, mborch]\r\n\r\n1.0 final (2008.11.6)\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\n- fixed image transparency for type icon used for the eCard Collection folderish\r\ntype.\r\n  Requires updating the 'content_icon' value within an eCardCollection's\r\n  portal_type listing from 'ecardcollection_icon.jpg' to\r\n'ecardcollection_icon.gif'.

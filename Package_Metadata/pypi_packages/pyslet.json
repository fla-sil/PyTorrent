It implements a number of LET-specific standards,\nincluding IMS QTI, Content Packaging and Basic LTI.  It also includes\nsupport for some general standards, including the data access standard\nOData (see http://www.odata.org).\n\n..  _Pyslet: http://www.pyslet.org\n\nPyslet was originally written to be the engine behind the QTI migration\ntool but it can be used independently as a support module for your own\nPython applications.\n\nFull documentation is hosted at http://pyslet.readthedocs.org\n\nPyslet currently supports Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3+, see docs for details.\n\n  \n\nDistribution\n------------\n\nPyslet is developed on GitHub: https://github.com/swl10/pyslet but it\ncan be downloaded and installed from the popular PyPi package\ndistribution site: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyslet using *pip*.\n\nWhile Pyslet is being actively developed the version on PyPi may lag\na few months behind the master branch on GitHub.  The unittests are\nfairly comprehensive and are automatically run against the master\nbranch using TravisCI_:\n\n.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/swl10/pyslet.png\n   :alt: Build Status\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/swl10/pyslet\n\n.. _TravisCI: https://travis-ci.org/swl10/pyslet\n\nUsers of older Python builds (e.g., Python 2.6 installed on older OS X\nversions) should be aware that pip may well fail to install itself or\nother modules due to a failure to connect to the PyPi repository. \nFixing this is hard and installing from source is recommended instead if\nyou are afflicted by this issue.\n\n\nInstalling from Source\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Pyslet package contains a setup.py script so you can install it\nby downloading the compressed archive, uncompressing it and then\nrunning the following command inside the package::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\nWindows users should note that when downloading a zipped archive of the\ndistribution some unittests may fail due to the ambiguity in character\nencoding file names in zip archives.  This is not an issue with Pyslet\nitself but an issue with some of the test data in the unittests folder.\nIf you use Git (or GitHub desktop) to checkout the master instead then\nthe unittests should work, please report any errors as the continuous\nbuild system does not catch Windows-specific bugs.\n\n\nCurrent Status & Road Map\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPyslet is going through a transition process at the moment as the QTI\nmigration tool that drives its development is gradually moving towards\nbeing distributed as an LTI tool rather than a desktop application.\n\nThe OData support is fairly robust, it is used to run the Cambridge Weather\nOData service which can be found at http://odata.pyslet.org/weather\n\nWhat's next?\n\n*   OData version 4: this will be a rewrite of the OData modules though\n    they will ultimately behave in a similar way to the existing\n    sub-package.\n    \n*   MySQL shim for the OData SQL storage model (90% complete and\n    functional)\n\n*   Improved support for LTI to take it beyond 'basic' (60% complete)\n\n\nI also write about Pyslet on my blog:\nhttp://swl10.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/Pyslet\n\n\nFeedback\n~~~~~~~~\n\nThe best way to get something changed is to create an issue or Pull\nrequest on GitHub, however, my contact details are available there on my\nprofile page if you just want to drop me an email with a suggestion or\nquestion.\n\n\nLicense\n~~~~~~~\n\nPyslet is distributed under the 'New' BSD license:\nhttp://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause, this decision was inherited\nfrom the early days of the code.

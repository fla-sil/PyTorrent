Signatures on\n  regular uids are sent to the corresponding email address only.\n\n* ``gcaff`` has no pinentry mechanism; users must have a working\n  ``gpg-agent`` to use ``gcaff``.\n\n* ``gcaff`` requires the user to supply a file containing keys to be\n  signed; no keys are fetched from keyservers.\n\n.. _caff: http://pgp-tools.alioth.debian.org/\n\n\nCryptographic concerns\n----------------------\n\n``gcaff`` signs keys using the SHA256 digest.  Future work could\nallow users to choose a different digest for signing.  Patches are\nwelcome!\n\n**Secret keys are never exported** from the GnuPG home directory,\nhowever, the corresponding public keys are exported to a temporary\nGnuPG keyring during the signing process.\n\nNo keys in the user's GnuPG home directory are modified during the\nsigning process.  Once signing is complete, all the signatures are\nwritten to a file whose location is reported.  The user may\n(manually) import keys from this file into her regular keyring.  A\nfuture version could offer to perform this step for the user.\nContributions are welcome.\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\n* GnuPG and gpg-agent\n* Python 2.7\n* PyGTK >=2, <3\n* a local mailer (SMTP), e.g. sendmail\n\nDebian / Ubuntu\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nInstall Python 2.7 and PyGTK in the normal way for your operating\nsystem.  Note that on many systems PyGTK cannot be installed with\n``pip``.\n\nTo install dependencies on a Debian or Ubuntu system (or other\nsystems using APT)::\n\n  sudo apt-get install gnupg gnupg-agent python-pip postfix python-gtk2\n\nIf ``gnupg-agent`` was not previously installed you will probably\nneed to log out and log in again to ensure that ``gpg-agent`` is\nrunning and the appropriate environment variables are set.\n\nDuring the postfix configuration dialog ensure you select **Internet\nSite** as the \"General type of mail configuration\".  If postfix is\nnot accepting mail you can run the configuration again::\n\n  sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix\n\nFedora\n^^^^^^\n\nFedora 20 and later releases do not have an MTA installed by\ndefault.  To install and configure::\n\n  sudo yum install -y postfix\n  sudo systemctl start postfix\n  sudo systemctl enable postfix\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install for all users, on a Unix system::\n\n  sudo pip install gcaff\n\nTo perform an installation to user site-packages::\n\n  pip install gcaff --user\n\nEnsure that the user site ``bin/`` directory is on the ``PATH`` if\ninstalling to user site-packages.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n::\n\n    gcaff --keyring keys-to-sign.asc\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n``gcaff`` is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nBug reports, general feedback, patches and translations are welcome.\n\nA list of desirable enhancements can be found in the file\n``TODO.rst``.\n\nTo submit a patch, please use ``git send-email`` or generate a\npull/merge request.

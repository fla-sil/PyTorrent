It is designed\nto operate on Gnucash save files (though not very flexibly, yet; it\nassumes a base-ten currency, for example) and to determine where your\nmoney is going each month.\n\nThe idea is that it reads through your Gnucash ledger, and for each\nmonth creates a tally of which accounts have provided income, which\naccounts have absorbed expenses, and therefore whether you finished the\nmonth with more or less cash than when you started it.  A running total\nis kept from month to month indicating whether your cash reserves are\nincreasing or depleting.  If the amount is slowly growing, then you\nmight think about investing or spending the surplus; if, instead, your\ncash-on-hand is inexorably decreasing, then you might be on the way to\nbankruptcy.\n\nYou can install this package with `easy_install`, and then simply run\nthe resulting command like::\n\n $ cashflow ledger.gnucash\n\nYou can also ask for the same report to be generated from Python,\nwhich requires a few more lines of effort.

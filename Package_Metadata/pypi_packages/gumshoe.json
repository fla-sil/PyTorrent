E.G.:\n\n    pip install mysql-python\n\nTo bootstrap the app, switch to where you want the application to 'live' and run:\n\n    gumshoe-init\n\nThis will create an initial configuration file that you can edit.  This will be\nused as the standard django 'settings' module.\n\nTo configure your database settings, open conf/settings.py and add the lines:\n\n    DATABASES['default'] = {\n        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',\n        'NAME': 'gumshoe_database_name',\n        'USER': 'gumshoe_database_user',\n        'PASSWORD': 'gumshoe_database_password',\n        'HOST': 'gumshoe_database_host',\n        'PORT': 'gumshoe_database_port',\n    }\n\nTo start the application, you can run:\n\n    gumshoe runserver 0.0.0.0:80\n\nIt is recommended that you serve the application through a real web stack like\nApache or Nginx + uWSGI, etc. rather than use the django development server as\nwould be the case above.\n\nThe wsgi module should be:\n\n    gumshoe.standalone.wsgi\n\nNotes\n=====\n\n* The home page for this project isn't up yet.\n\n* Issues should be entered via the Github issue tracker at the moment.

For example, if you have two graphs in a directory:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ cd default_graph_dir\n    $ ls\n    graph.svg graph2.svg\n\nThen you can create two metadata files using YAML format, where you can\nconfigure how the graphs will be displayed:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ cat graph.yaml\n    name: graph.svg\n    family: 'Category 1'\n    title: '*Real serious* graph'\n    text: |\n        The description\n\n    $ cat graph2.yaml\n    name: graph2.svg\n    family: 'Category 2'\n    title: 'Another important graph'\n\nYou may then start the graph dashboard. You will get a nice web\ninterface displaying your graphs, and a search box with autocompletion.\nYou can easily navigate and share your graphs.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ GraphDash --root .\n    * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5555/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmadeusITGroup/GraphDash/master/docs/example.gif\n   :alt: \n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nClone and install (in user space):\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    git clone https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/graphdash.git\n    cd graphdash\n    pip install --user .\n\nOr use the Python package:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install --user graphdash\n\nLaunch the webapp\n-----------------\n\nFor user-space installation, make sure your ``$PATH`` includes\n``~/.local/bin``.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ GraphDash -r default_graph_dir\n    * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5555/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n\nThe dashboard can be configured with a YAML config file and the\n``-c/--conf`` option:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ cat docs/graphdash.yaml\n    root: ../default_graph_dir\n    title: \"Example of title ;)\"\n    subtitle: \"Example of subtitle\"\n\n    $ GraphDash -c docs/graphdash.yaml\n    * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5555/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n\nYou can generate a template of configuration file:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ GraphDash -C template.yaml\n\nServe with Gunicorn\n-------------------\n\nIf not already installed on your machine, install ``Gunicorn``:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install --user gunicorn setproctitle  # on Fedora you may need to install libffi-devel before\n\nSince you can import the webapp through ``graphdash:app``, you can serve\nit with ``Gunicorn``:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8888 --pid server.pid graphdash:app\n\nThe configuration file of the webapp can be set with the ``CONF``\nenvironment variable. With ``Gunicorn``, you can pass environment\nvariables to the workers with ``--env``:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8888 --pid server.pid --env CONF=docs/graphdash.yaml graphdash:app\n\nBut you should *not* use these commands yourself, that is what\n``GraphDashManage`` is for!\n\nGraphDashManage\n---------------\n\n``GraphDashManage`` is used to ``start``, ``stop``, ``restart`` the\ninstances of ``Gunicorn`` serving ``graphdash:app``. It needs a\nconfiguration file in the current directory:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ cat settings.sh\n    ALL_MODES=(\n       ['prod']=\"docs/graphdash.yaml\"\n       ['test']=\"docs/graphdash.yaml\"\n    )\n    ALL_PORTS=(\n       ['prod']=1234\n       ['test']=5678\n    )\n    WORKERS=3\n\nThen you can manage multiple instances of ``GraphDash`` using\n``Gunicorn`` with:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ GraphDashManage start prod\n    [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:1234\n    [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 30403\n    [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 30404\n    [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 30405\n\n    $ GraphDashManage start test\n    [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:5678\n    ...\n\nYou can generate a template of settings:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ GraphDashManage template > template.sh # to be moved to settings.sh\n\nWebapp configuration file\n-------------------------\n\nPossible entries (everything is optional):\n\n-  ``root``: the root directory of the graphs\n-  ``families``: path to the families metadata file (optional)\n-  ``title``: the title of the webapp\n-  ``subtitle``: the subtitle of the webapp\n-  ``placeholder``: the default text in the search field\n-  ``header``: an optional message at the top (markdown syntax)\n-  ``footer``: an optional message at the bottom (markdown syntax)\n-  ``showfamilynumbers``: a boolean to toggle family numbering (default\n   is true)\n-  ``showgraphnumbers``: a boolean to toggle graph numbering (default is\n   true)\n-  ``theme``: change css theme (default is dark)\n-  ``keep``: the proportion of common words kept for autocompletion\n-  ``logfile``: change default log file of the webapp\n-  ``raw``: when loading, look for all graphs and ignore metadata\n-  ``verbose``: a boolean indicating verbosity when loading application\n-  ``debug``: debug mode (enable Grunt livereload, enable Flask debug\n   mode)\n-  ``headless``: headless mode (only search is available, no page is\n   rendered)\n-  ``port``: when launched with Flask development server only, port\n\nGraph metadata\n--------------\n\nSeveral attributes are supported:\n\n-  ``name``: the path to the graph\n-  ``title``: title of the graph, recommended for display purposes\n   (markdown syntax)\n-  ``family``: the subsection in which the graph is\n-  ``index``: an optional list of keywords describing the graph (useful\n   for search feature)\n-  ``text``: an optional description of the graph (markdown syntax)\n-  ``pretext``: an optional message appearing before the graph (markdown\n   syntax)\n-  ``file``: optional path to the raw data\n-  ``export``: optional path to the exportable graph (for example, a PNG\n   file)\n-  ``rank``: integer, optional value used to change graphs order\n   (default uses titles)\n-  ``showtitle``: a boolean to toggle title display for the graph\n   (default is false)\n-  ``labels``: a list of labels (like ``'new'``) which will be rendered\n   in the UI as colored circles\n-  ``other``: other metadata not used by ``GraphDash``, but may be\n   needed by other things reading the metadata\n\nNote that if the ``name`` attribute is missing, the graph will not be\nshown and the text will be displayed anyway, like a blog entry.\n\nFamily metadata\n---------------\n\nYou may put a ``.FAMILIES.yaml`` file at the root of the graph\ndirectory. This file may contain metadata for families. It should be a\nYAML list:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    - family: chairs\n      rank : 0\n    - family: tables\n      rank : 1\n      text: This is a description\n      alias: This text will appear instead of \"tables\"\n      labels: new\n\nEach element of the list should be a dict containing:\n\n-  ``family``: the family considered\n-  ``rank``: integer, optional value used to change families order\n   (default uses family name)\n-  ``text``: an optional description of the family (markdown syntax)\n-  ``alias``: an optional name who may be longer than the one in the url\n   (useful to build nice urls)\n-  ``labels``: a list of labels (like ``new``) which will be rendered in\n   the UI as colored circles\n\nAvailable labels are ``new``, ``update``, ``bugfix``, ``warning``,\n``error``, ``ongoing``, ``obsolete``. You may give other labels which\nwill be rendered with defaults colors. For customization, you may\nspecify your own labels with a dict syntax:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    labels:\n    - name: newlabel\n      color: white\n      text_color: black\n      text: \"NEW LABEL\"\n      tooltip: null\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nIf you wish to contribute, you need ``Grunt`` to generate new css/js\nfiles from sass/coffee source files.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    npm install --no-bin-links # may need to repeat\n    grunt\n\nDebugging can be made with source map files for browser supporting them\nin their debugging tools. If not, the ``Gruntfile.js`` enables an option\nto generate non-minified assets.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    grunt --dev\n\nWith the ``debug`` mode enabled, Grunt will use the livereload mechanism\nto reload the browser if any file has changed (and Flask debug mode will\nreload the server as well).\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    GraphDash --debug & # or python -m graphdash\n    grunt watch\n\nIf you used ``Gunicorn`` with a PID file, Grunt will automatically\nreload it if any Python files change.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8888 --pid server.pid graphdash:app &\n    grunt watch\n\nYou can use ``tox`` build packages and run tests.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    tox\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/graphdash", "keywords": "", "license": "Copyright (c) 2016 Amadeus s.a.s.\n\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

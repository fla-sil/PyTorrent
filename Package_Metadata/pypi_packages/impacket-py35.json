Impacket is focused on providing low-level\nprogrammatic access to the packets and for some protocols (e.g.\nSMB1-3 and MSRPC) the protocol implementation itself.\nPackets can be constructed from scratch, as well as parsed from \nraw data, and the object oriented API makes it simple to work with \ndeep hierarchies of protocols. The library provides a set of tools\nas examples of what can be done within the context of this library.\n\nA description of some of the tools can be found at:\nhttps://www.secureauth.com/labs/open-source-tools/impacket\n\nWhat protocols are featured?\n----------------------------\n\n * Ethernet, Linux \"Cooked\" capture.\n * IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP, ARP.\n * IPv4 and IPv6 Support.\n * NMB and SMB1, SMB2 and SMB3 (high-level implementations).\n * MSRPC version 5, over different transports: TCP, SMB/TCP, SMB/NetBIOS and HTTP.\n * Plain, NTLM and Kerberos authentications, using password/hashes/tickets/keys.\n * Portions/full implementation of the following MSRPC interfaces: EPM, DTYPES, LSAD, LSAT, NRPC, RRP, SAMR, SRVS, WKST, SCMR, BKRP, DHCPM, EVEN6, MGMT, SASEC, TSCH, DCOM, WMI.\n * Portions of TDS (MSSQL) and LDAP protocol implementations.\n\n\nGetting Impacket\n================\n\n* [Current and past releases](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/releases)\n* [Trunk](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)\n\nSetup\n=====\n\nQuick start\n-----------\n\nGrab the latest stable release, unpack it and run `pip install .` from the directory where you placed it. Isn't that easy?\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n * A Python interpreter. Python 2.6/2.7 and Python 3.6 are known to work. \n   1. If you want to run the examples and you have Python < 2.7, you\n      will need to install the `argparse` package for them to work.\n   2. For Kerberos support you will need `pyasn1` package\n   3. For cryptographic operations you will need `pycryptodomex` package\n   4. For some examples you will need `pyOpenSSL` (rdp_check.py) and ldap3 (ntlmrelayx.py)\n   5. For ntlmrelayx.py you will also need `ldapdomaindump`, `flask` and `ldap3`\n   6. If you're under Windows, you will need `pyReadline`\n * A recent release of Impacket.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nIn order to install the source execute the following command from the\ndirectory where the Impacket's distribution has been unpacked: `pip install .`\nThis will install the classes into the default\nPython modules path; note that you might need special permissions to\nwrite there. For more information on what commands and options are\navailable from setup.py, run `python setup.py --help-commands`.\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nIf you want to run the library test cases you need to do mainly three things:\n\n1. Install and configure a Windows 2012 R2 Domain Controller.\n   * Be sure the RemoteRegistry service is enabled and running.\n2. Configure the [dcetest.cfg](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_20/tests/SMB_RPC/dcetests.cfg) file with the necessary information\n3. Install tox (`pip install tox`)\n\nOnce that's done, you can run `tox` and wait for the results. If all goes well, all test cases should pass.\nYou will also have a coverage HTML report located at `impacket/tests/htlmcov/index.html`\n\nLicensing\n=========\n\nThis software is provided under under a slightly modified version of\nthe Apache Software License.

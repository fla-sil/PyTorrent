The APIs and libraries I tested required the accurate spelling of song names and artist name to be passed in for fetching the song lyrics. And even after passing all of these information, there were still some song lyrics which weren't available in their APIs and libraries. \n\nThis is the reason why I had to write an algorithm for fetching and scraping song lyrics from various websites even for any misspelled song name passed-in by the user.\n\n## Installation\n\n```python\npip install lyrics-extractor\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n* You will need an API Key and Engine ID of Google Custom Search JSON API.\n  * Create your new Custom Search Engine here to get your Engine ID: https://cse.google.com/cse/create/new\n  * Add any of the following or all websites as per your choice in your Custom Search Engine:\n    * https://genius.com/\n    * http://www.lyricsted.com/\n    * http://www.lyricsbell.com/\n    * https://www.glamsham.com/\n    * http://www.lyricsoff.com/\n    * http://www.lyricsmint.com/\n  * You are free to customise your Custom Search Engine by prioritising any of your preferred keywords, excluding any web pages or turning on the 'Safe Search' feature.\n\n    **NOTE: Please don't turn on the 'Search the entire Web' feature as it is currently not possible to scrape from any random sites appearing in the search results.**\n  * Visit here to get your API key: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview\n* Python installed on your machine.\n* BeautifulSoup and Requests library.\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. Import this module in your Python program.\n\n    ```python\n    from lyrics_extractor import Song_Lyrics\n    ```\n\n2. Assign a Variable to the Class by passing in the Google Custom Search JSON API key and Engine ID received after creating a custom search engine.\n\n    ```python\n    extract_lyrics = Song_Lyrics(GCS_API_KEY, GCS_ENGINE_ID)\n    ```\n\n    Replace 'GCS_API_KEY' and 'GCS_ENGINE_ID' with the API key and Engine ID received.\n\n3. Get the title and the lyrics for the song by passing in the song name in the class function.\n\n    ```python\n    song_title, song_lyrics = extract_lyrics.get_lyrics(\"Shape of You\")\n    ```\n\n4. If you got the title and the lyrics for the song correctly then change the song name 'Shape of you' and try again with any misspelled song name like 'Shaep fo you'.\n\n5. Voila! You have received your requested song lyrics even after passing in a misspelled song name.\n\n## How to Contribute\n\n1. Fork this repository.\n2.

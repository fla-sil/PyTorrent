Unlike\nPIL, it's actively maintained and easy to install. It's pretty great. There's\nonly one problem, which is that users must first uninstall PIL before\ninstalling Pillow, as they share a namespace.\n\nThis makes it very hard for Python modules or products that need to run on a\nvariety of configurations to easily depend on either PIL or Pillow without\ninevitably breaking something (perhaps in subtle ways). That makes it hard to\nsafely  transition.\n\nThis package aims to \"solve\" that by providing a single dependency that can\nintelligently depend on either PIL or Pillow, based on what's already on the\nsystem. Packages that still need to work if PIL is installed, but aim to\ntransition to Pillow, can simply depend on the ``pillowfight`` package.\n\n\nHow it works\n------------\n\nThis package is provided as a source distribution with a simple setup script.\nWhen ``pillowfight`` is installed for the first time, its setup script will\nrun and start inspecting the system.\n\nThe setup script will look to see if PIL is already installed. If so, it will\nprint a warning saying that PIL is deprecated and to install Pillow. It will\nthen turn around and depend on PIL.\n\nIf PIL is not installed, it will instead depend on Pillow.\n\n\nUsing pillowfight\n-----------------\n\nSimply replace your PIL dependency with ``pillowfight`` in ``setup``'s\n``install_requires`` list:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    setup(name='MyPackage',\n          version='1.0',\n          install_requires=[\n              'pillowfight'\n          ]\n    )\n\n\nWhy we wrote this\n-----------------\n\nWe use Django and Pillow for a product that sysadmins can install in their\nnetworks. There are a lot of configurations out there, and a lot of older\nsystems already using PIL.\n\nWe've been trying to figure out the right strategy for getting new and\nexisting users onto Pillow without breaking any installs. We don't have much\ncontrol over their systems, so we knew we had to be clever.\n\nA lot of projects out there seem to have modified their ``setup.py`` files to\ncheck what's on the system, but in practice, that doesn't work too well. When\nbuilding Python eggs, the ``requires.txt`` files would be populated with\neither ``PIL`` or ``Pillow``, and that just wasn't going to work.\n\nSo we wrote this as a way to have a stable dependency that could do the right\nthing. We hope others will find it useful.\n\n\nWho's using it\n--------------\n\nWe're using it for our code review product,\n`Review Board <http://www.reviewboard.org/>`_.\n\nIf you're using it, `let us know <mailto:christian@beanbaginc.com>`_.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/beanbaginc/pillowfight", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "pillowfight", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pillowfight/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pillowfight/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/beanbaginc/pillowfight"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pillowfight/0.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Eases the transition from PIL to Pillow for projects.", "version": "0.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>Pillow is a replacement for PIL that works as a drop-in replacement.

As an\nexercise and because we love so much to reinvent the wheel, I've tried\nto port this sweet IRC server to Python3 and to improve it in a way or\nanother.\n\nTo see the changes between upstream and this version, please read the\n`CHANGES.md <CHANGES.md>`__ document. This document also contains a\nmini-roadmap of the things I'd like to improve in the future.\n\n**WARNING: This version is Python 3 only ; tested with Python 3.6.**\n\nOmgircd3 is an Internet Relay Chat Daemon (IRCd) written in Python. It is\ndesigned to be as simple as possible, while still providing a complete\nIRC experience.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nAs of the version ``1.0.0``, you can install ``omgircd3`` using pip::\n\n    pip install omgircd3\n\nIt installs a console script you may want to use to instanciate your IRC\nserver::\n\n    omgircd3\n\nOptionally,you may want to create a ``config.ini`` file which will\ncontain your configuration variables. Copy the ``config.sample.ini``\nfile to create your own custom configuration, and run the following:\n\n::\n\n    omgircd3 --config=path/to/your/config.ini\n\nDevelopment mode\n----------------\n\nOnce you've cloned the repository, you can use the main scripts directly,\nso you don't have to pip install the source code.\n\n::\n\n    python omgircd3/ircd.py\n\nAny option available for the \"binary\" script will also be available for the\ndirect scripts.\n\n\nAn alternative method to run Omgircd3 is using the ``ircdreload.py``\nscript. This launch script provides a means to reload the IRCd code on\nthe fly while it is running. This script is only recommended for use in\ndevelopment.\n\n::\n\n    python omgircd3/ircdreload.py\n\nIn order to reload the IRCd code, type Control+c (``C-c``). You will\nthen be prompted with ``[r/q]``. Typing ``r`` at this prompt will cause\nall IRCd code to be reloaded and the IRCd to continue to run. Typing\n``q`` at this prompt will cause the IRCd to shut down and exit.\n\nAdditionally, if an unhandled exception occurs in the IRCd code, it will\nbe caught by the script and its traceback will be printed out. The same\nprompt will then appear in order to give an opportunity to fix the code\nand then reload the fixed code, without the server going down.\n\nAs for the ``ircd.py`` script, you can also use your configuration file:\n\n::\n\n    python omgircd3/ircdreload.py --config=path/to/your/config.ini\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nIn its current state, Omgircd3 is not very configurable. The main focus\nhas been to focus on getting the IRCd to run perfectly, and then make it\nmore configurable afterwards. The few configuration options available\nare located in ``config.sample.ini``. Use this file as a template to\nconfigure it your own way.\n\nLogging level\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nBy default, the logging level is set to ``INFO``. You can change this using the\n``LOGGING_LEVEL`` environment variable, like this:\n\n::\n\n    LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG python omgircd3/ircd.py\n\n\nProgress\n--------\n\nFor documentation on development progress, see ``progress.md``.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2011, Curtis McEnroe curtis@cmcenroe.me + Copyright \u00a9 2015-2017, Bruno Bord bruno@jehaisleprintemps.net\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any\npurpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\ncopyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES\nWITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

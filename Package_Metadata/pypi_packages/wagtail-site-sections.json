Or club, or business or whatever. So you download a bunch of\ncomponent templates for the front end.\n\n> *Man, they look great!!! Built by professional designers, everything looks totes amazeballs!*\n\nYou'll turn this into a proper app eventually, so wordpress is out. You want something serving your site and \nSo you build a fantastic looking site. But the client really ought to be able to edit their own website content... \nthey need either:\n- A CMS.\n- Knowledge of how to chop and change their site around at the code level, then rebuild and deploy it to wherever.\n\nSigh. And:\n- I don't want to be charging my clients a half day every time they need a site tweak, it feels wrong.\n- I don't want to be hassled by clients for site tweaks, its annoying and there are bigger fish to fry.\n\nSo lets just set them up with any ol' page structure they want!\n\nEnter wagtail streamfield - the [docs]() for streamfield show you how to quickly and flexibly create streamfield blocks\nto manage sections like this.\n\nIf you need flexibility, create your own blocks! But in my experience, most sites need exactly the same BS time after time.\nSo here it is. A bunch of common blocks for building website chunks.\n\nEither copy/paste them, install this app and use everything out of the box, or subclass blocks from this app to customise.\n\n\n## An Example\n\nI built [traffickingpast.uk](TODO) using wagtail_site_blocks.  \n\nI took templates from [creative-tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit-pro-react), built site pages\nand an app, using wagtail in headless mode to administer the app contents (stories, legislation records and locations\nfor the map).\n\nBut the site pages were practically uneditable by my clients - they'd need to know how to edit the JSX as well as\nunderstand the git flow in order to deploy changes. It's a big ask, and not what those ridiculously clever and dedicated\nhistorians were put on earth to do.\n\nI was already using [wagtail-react-streamfield](TODO) to render the contents of the stories, so figured why not do the same\nwith page content? I just added a streamfield with wagtail_site_blocks to my BasePage model and bingo... no technical\nskill required to make substantial edits to the site.\n\n\n## Emotional gratification\n\nI don't publish OSS for money. I do it:\n - to have impact on the world\n - for the emotional gratification of helping people out\n - to repay all the OSS developers who've made me better and quicker at what I do.\n\n**Bottom line: Star this repo on Github if you use or like it, that's my payment! :)** \n\n\n## Architectural decision - streamfields not snippets\n\nI could just as easily have made each section a SectionSnippet (of some different type), rather than using streamfield. But:\n - This is somewhat less flexible in terms of arranging page content\n - It's less easily extensible to add new sections\n - Data is stored off the Page Model in a different table, and I think it's best to keep Page data (which eventually all\n gets rendered to what is essentially a static page) all in one place rahter than creating unnecessary joins)\n\n\n## Templates\n\n**\"But, where are the templates?!\"** is a natural question. Answer: There aren't any templates so far... but you can add\nyours straightforwardly.\n\nI run all my wagtail installations in headless mode with a react front end, so can only justify putting in place the\ntemplates for managing the sections on wagtail (for now). If there's enough traffic to be concerned about performance of\na SPA instead of server-side rendered pages, I'll add gatsby into the mix to pre-build the site pages.\nThat'll scale epically.\n\nIf you'd like to make a PR so this can be used more easily in a non-headless mode, I'm very open to collaboration :)\n\n\n## Displaying sections on the front end\n\n### Create components\n\nIts up to you how you wire them up, but you basically need a nice looking component for each section type which accepts\nas props the schema of the section (see below for section schema).\n\n### React: Turn streamfield data into component props\n\nOn the frontend, I use react (see aforementioned nanorant about using wagtail in a headless mode). \n\nI use my other library, [wagtail-react-streamfield]() to extract streamfield data as component props, and render the \nstreamfield as lists/hierarchies of components, selecting component by streamfield type.\n\n\n## Roadmap\n\nI'd like to include many more sections. I'm adding as I use them on a site. If you need a section, either:\n- Fork, add, and make a PR. I'll review when I have time and if it meets quality then I'll add.\n- write out the schema for the section you want and chuck that into an issue. I'll consider adding at some point but no promises.\n- If you want \"some point\" to be very soon, and want \"no promises\" to be \"promises\" then that's cool but I'll need to be paid ;)\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nWagtail_site_sections is tested on Django 2.1 or later and Wagtail 2.3 or later.\n\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nPython: 3.6\n\nDjango: 2.1\n\nWagtail: 2.3\n\n\n## Getting started\n\nInstalling from pip:\n\n```\npip install wagtail_site_sections\n```\n\n### If you already have your own page models and don't want to add another table/app...\nAdd the following to your *Page model:\n```\n```\n\n### Or if you want to use the SectionsPage model...\n\nAdd to `INSTALLED_APPS`:\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    ...,\n    'wagtail_site_sections',\n    ...\n]\n```\nRun the migrations:\n```\npython manage.py migrate wagtail_site_sections\n```\nThen add a SectionPage to your CMS and give it a whirl.", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/thclark/wagtail_site_sections", "keywords": "wagtail,django,events", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "wagtail-site-sections", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/wagtail-site-sections/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/wagtail-site-sections/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/thclark/wagtail_site_sections"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/wagtail-site-sections/0.2.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Site Sections in Wagtail streamfield", "version": "0.2.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Wagtail Site Sections <a href=\"https://travis-ci.com/thclark/wagtail_site_sections\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Build Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/7c596bcb41e0ed412ef309d26d941bd42bb8fa39/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e636f6d2f7468636c61726b2f7761677461696c5f736974655f73656374696f6e732e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a></h1>\n<p>Common wagtail streamfield blocks for quickly building website sections.</p>\n<p>Hero panels, \"our team\" views, product list, FAQs, etc) added to pages as wagtail stream fields.</p>\n<h2>Why</h2>\n<p>You're creating a website and app for an awesome startup.

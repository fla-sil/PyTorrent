It is useful in determining the methylation\r\npatterns for promoter regions and transcribable regions for different genes. \r\nThe package has a foundation on the package cruzdb, pysam, and the local BLAST\r\nalignment tool via NCBI. These packages are used to gather the information about\r\nthe genes you want to analyze. Then this package sorts out the bam files of the \r\ngenome to look for methylation. All functions needed are accessible by typing\r\n\"from pymethyl.functions import *\". Some functions are able to be customized \r\nfor peak calling and mapping quality. An example may look like this.\r\n\r\nAn example may look like this::\r\n\r\n    #!/usr/bin/env python\r\n\r\n>>> from pymethyl.functions import *\r\n>>> info = regionInfo()\r\nWhat is the name of the gene you are interested in?: NUF2\r\nWhat is the reference genome you are searching?

This is a more friendly user interface to gather information that the cruzdb\r\npackage already gets. This function looks at the transcribable region or the promoter region of the named gene. The idea is to put \r\nin your gene name, the database you would want to search that gene in, and the region that you are interested in looking at.\r\nFor example we are going to pick the gene NUF2 and database hg18. You can find different databases on the UCSC genomic browser website. \r\nThe databases are under assembly.\r\n<https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?command=start>\"\"\"\r\n\r\n>>> regionInfo()\r\nWhat is the name of the gene you are interested in?: NUF2\r\nWhat is the reference genome you are searching?

It tells you the gene name, chromosome, starting position, and ending position.\r\nof the transcribable region. This information is necessary to make a database as well as extract information from the bam file. Lets \r\nsave this information to a text file called NUF2_Promoter.txt on our desktop.

The format of the input file must be gene name \\t chromosome \\t start\r\nposition \\t end position \\n. This function also takes an input file of a sorted bam file with it's bai file in the same directory. The\r\nfunction also takes the sample name which will be the name of the directory created and the read lengths. For methylation data this can\r\nbe reads of 50bp - 250bp. With that user input, the program will create a directory with a file named for the gene that it represents.\r\nThe files inside of the directory contain all of the reads and format them as start position \\t end position \\t mapping quality \\t sequence.\r\nThis file is the input file for findMethylation function.\r\n\r\n>>> extractBamFile()\r\nChoose the data file which holds the information of the gene that you are looking for.

It is a quick and dirty algorithm that finds\r\nthe places of hypermethylation. It can be customized depending on what you decide is significant. It works by taking all of the sequences\r\nin the information file that you give it and finds areas where there is X (a number you choose) number of overlapping sequences.

Choose the text file to make into a database\n<br>Name of your Database: NUF2\n<br>NCBI Database type, leave empty if unsure: nucl\n<br>Which database will you get the sequences from Example: hg18 : hg18\n<br>Your database is processing, not to worry, this can take some time.\n<br>Done\n<br>ok\n<br>test_3 (__main__.TestSequenceFunctions) ... Choose the data file which holds the information of the gene \\\n<br>that you are looking for. Format gene name, chromosome, start position, end position.\n<br>Choose the BAM file that you are extracting reads from.\n<br>What is the name of the sample the reads are coming from: Sample1\n<br>What is the length of each read's sequence: 50\n<br>Done\n<br>test_4 (__main__.TestSequenceFunctions) ... Chose the data file which holds results from bam file. This should be a text file.\n<br>Type the gene name you are looking at. Example: 'ACACA' : NUF2\n<br>What is the mapping quality needed for a read to be significant. Enter 0 for every read: 0\n<br>Type the amount of coverage you would like have a sequence considered methylated. Example: 5 (which means regions have 5 overlapping sequences are saved) : 5\n<br>Done\n<br>Your results are in your desktop folder named Methylated Results\n<br>ok\n<br>test_5 (__main__.TestSequenceFunctions) ... Enter the type of BLAST that you want to perform. Types of BLAST can be found on the NCBI website. Example: blastn : blastn\n<br>Name of the database you are searching. Would be the database you made with the MakeDatabase() function. Example: Sequences : NUF2\n<br>Went through 1 data files\n<br>Counted 1 events\n<br>ok\n<br>test_6 (__main__.TestSequenceFunctions) ... Type the methylated gene you are looking at: NUF2\n<br>ok\n<br>test_7 (__main__.TestSequenceFunctions) ... ok\n<br>\n<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br>Ran 7 tests in 52.829s\n<br>\n<br>OK\n          </div>"}, "last_serial": 1184120, "releases": {"0.1.0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "2800ebb8181c2159f5746583d0ff1a14", "sha256": "49dc643bc2701fd36d348c54b2f6b633877e0dd6111bd22e2ada191587da9a4f"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "PyMethyl-0.1.0.zip", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "2800ebb8181c2159f5746583d0ff1a14", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 38196, "upload_time": "2014-08-07T23:18:48", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2014-08-07T23:18:48.526704Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/a3/7e/5b7aeef8213f60ab35b3d64f0777f3a8b722b66d0bda325b09769f409f96/PyMethyl-0.1.0.zip", "yanked": false}], "0.1.1": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "bc2dd793ca8dacb17664693938b8f5e2", "sha256": "598fb40246b1cd5227ee2bfea3570883fb0e709f3ac2b4ea48af02911e3beeae"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "PyMethyl-0.1.1.zip", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "bc2dd793ca8dacb17664693938b8f5e2", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 38191, "upload_time": "2014-08-07T23:21:33", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2014-08-07T23:21:33.336162Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/9f/27/8847eb5fd5435d7616b9b308b0d620208d32d293d089e9a161beaebb4168/PyMethyl-0.1.1.zip", "yanked": false}], "0.1.2": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "20e227f07f4c9d4d839c82f1255668ce", "sha256": "446778982c9055bcdde3080665734313264b31a620eb075f8a063398c4ad086e"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "PyMethyl-0.1.2.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "20e227f07f4c9d4d839c82f1255668ce", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 30981, "upload_time": "2014-08-08T14:58:37", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2014-08-08T14:58:37.421688Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b2/de/b5902296d164e7efebf54b98a27a97025aeb714012b9b7b0cfb40d25f7fa/PyMethyl-0.1.2.tar.gz", "yanked": false}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "1e4f152720c83ad2c9580d9e184f05d7", "sha256": "6f27e27dd08073f89852983a6d696059cb1f2f56e0ad62a692ceef407b301651"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "PyMethyl-0.1.2.zip", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "1e4f152720c83ad2c9580d9e184f05d7", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 38191, "upload_time": "2014-08-07T23:23:49", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2014-08-07T23:23:49.216049Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/94/dd/464e74fe0aba44f809e4819b60537882a76788e7582f44770436287be625/PyMethyl-0.1.2.zip", "yanked": false}], "0.1.3": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "4ee7a1798582852afc272c6b192eefbf", "sha256": "ce228a4f062455e8086162957b23615a5686a03e18552222669a927b570889b8"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "PyMethyl-0.1.3.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "4ee7a1798582852afc272c6b192eefbf", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 30960, "upload_time": "2014-08-08T15:01:52", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2014-08-08T15:01:52.662176Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/3d/12/68ebac1a175166fc3ca70bccf054cfae9b0799b9459cc75d59775483af6d/PyMethyl-0.1.3.tar.gz", "yanked": false}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "4ee7a1798582852afc272c6b192eefbf", "sha256": "ce228a4f062455e8086162957b23615a5686a03e18552222669a927b570889b8"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "PyMethyl-0.1.3.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "4ee7a1798582852afc272c6b192eefbf", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 30960, "upload_time": "2014-08-08T15:01:52", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2014-08-08T15:01:52.662176Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/3d/12/68ebac1a175166fc3ca70bccf054cfae9b0799b9459cc75d59775483af6d/PyMethyl-0.1.3.tar.gz", "yanked": false}], "timestamp": "Fri May  8 03:02:11 2020"}

Denying the write\noperations outside of this directory is most basic application of\na sandbox here.\n\n2. Instead of actually doing some operations like changing permission or\nownership of files, we can just log them, and mark in the generated package.\nThat way we dont need to be a root user in order to build a package with\nsuch properties.\n\n3. We can log many build operations, and analyze them to see actual\nbuild dependencies of the package for example.\n\n4. We can build package in a temporary directory, but let it think that\nin runs in root directory with everything out there is read only mapped\ninside. That can greatly simplify build scripts.\n\nThere are two ways to sandbox a build script within user context without\nresorting to special kernel modules:\n\n1. We can override functions of glibc with LD_PRELOAD. Since this requires\nexecuting the script inside a new shell, passing Python variables between\nbuilder and scripts is hacky and cumbersome.\n\n2. We can intercept system calls with kernel ptrace interface.\n\nWe decided to go with the latter way. There is already a good ptrace\nsandbox framework for Python, called Subterfugue. Apart from a small\nC binding for ptrace call, it is completely written in Python.\nUnfortunately dealing with each system call with Python is quite\nslow for a build farm. There are over a thousand packages, and\nsome of them like OpenOffice.org or kdebase takes a huge time to\ncompile even on high end computers.\n\nThus we wrote catbox, a small sandboxing module for PiSi (the package\nmanager for Pardus Linux). It is completely written in C, and it wont\nprovide custom system call hooks or advanced modifications to the\nguest environment like Subterfugue.\n\nAlthough, catbox started as a sandboxing module for PiSi, it is now a\nmore generic sandbox module that can be used generically.\n\nEvent Hooks:\n\n* child_initialized(pid): Event hook is called on parent process but\n  after child is initialized to be traced and before parent notifies\n  child to continue. Pid of the child process is given as the only\n  argument. (available in version 1.4+)\n\n* child_died_unexpectedly(pid): Event hook is called when we got a\n  signal/event from a child but the child was already dead. Pid of the\n  child process is given as the only argument. (available in version\n  1.4+)\n\n\nDependencies:\n\n* pcre (OPTIONAL): If enabled path can be defined with regular\n  expressions. Just append --enable-pcre to the setup.py command.\n\n* Testify: (https://github.com/Yelp/Testify) Testify is used for\n  unittests only.\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/Pardus-Linux/catbox", "keywords": null, "license": "UNKNOWN", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "catbox", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/catbox/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/catbox/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/Pardus-Linux/catbox"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/catbox/1.7.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Fast sandbox implementation for Python", "version": "1.7.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>Sandbox is a mechanism which provides a tighly-controlled set of resources\nfor guest programs to run in.

When you are staring at a single\nlist of 400 reviews, it's completely overwhelming.\n\nSisyphus never had it so good.\n\nThe Solution\n============\n\nI've found that slicing up the giant review task into a set of smaller\nbuckets that you can see actually get smaller as you go through them\nbecomes a far more motivating way of looking at reviews.\n\nAs of Gerrit 2.6 there is support for building custom dashboards, both\non the server side, and on the client side (as a URL). These are\nreally powerful.\n\nThe server side definition for these dashboards is pretty easy to\nunderstand, however you need really extreme levels of permissions to\ncreate these dashboards. The client side definition is a single URL\nwhich is hard to manipulate inline.\n\nThis tool takes the server side definition, creates the client side\nencoding of it, and spits that URL out on the command line.

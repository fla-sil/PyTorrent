The\ngenerated rules can be easily applied using the *iptables-restore* utility.\n\nAt time of this writing, Django Conntrackt is compatible with the\nfollowing Django and Python versions:\n\n- *Python 2.7.x*\n- *Django 1.5.x*\n\n\nWhy was this application created?\n---------------------------------\n\nThe application was created in order to alleviate painful and error prone\ntracking of IP addresses and network communications inside of spreadsheet\nfiles. Another reason was the need to create simple iptables rules based on this\ninformation with as little hassle as possible.\n\nThe *iptables* generation requirements for Django Conntrackt were farily simple,\nand do not include any complex functionality. It all boils down to rejecting all\ncommunication except for explicitly defined links.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nDjango Conntrackt sports a number of useful features for system administrators\nand integrators:\n\n* Managing entities through multiple projects (separating the entities\n  per-project basis).\n* Grouping entities inside of a project in one or more locations (which can be\n  either logical or physical).\n* Specifying entities that represent servers, routers, workstations, networks,\n  subnets or any other networked device or abstraction within a network.\n* Specifying multiple network interfaces for each entity.\n* Specifying the communication link between two entities, which includes\n  information such as protocol and port.\n* Generation of *iptables* rules for devices based on GNU/Linux that can be\n  consumed by the *iptables-restore* utility.\n* Generation of *iptables* rules on per-location/project basis (multiple\n  *iptables* rule files inside of a single *ZIP* file).\n\nFor more information, please have a look at full documentation at one of the\nfollowing websites:\n\n* https://django-conntrackt.readthedocs.io/\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nDjango Conntrackt *application* is licensed under the terms of GPLv3, or (at\nyour option) any later version.

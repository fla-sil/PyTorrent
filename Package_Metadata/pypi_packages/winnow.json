It has several distinct parts:\n\n+ A set of json schemata for documents describing products and associated information.\n+ A schema for defining sets of configuration options in products.\n+ A defined set of basic logical operations for manipulating documents with options.\n+ A python library that implements these operations\n\nIn order to write and publish winnow documents you use the first two of these as they define how winnow documents are constructed. To apply logical operations to, and manipulate, winnow documents you will need to understand winnow's operations and it's library that implements them.\n\n\n## resources and documents\n\nSome winnow documents describe named resources others do not. \n\nResource documents have certain features: they are discoverable at a permanent url defined in the document itself; they are versioned and use Semantic Version numbers; these versions are themselves discoverable and resources may inherit from another resource of the same type.\n\nEight resource types are currently defined in winnow.

This can be done using tools available from [json-schema.org](http://json-schema.org/implementations.html), or using winnow's python library like this:\n\n```python\n    with open(filepath, \"r\") as f:\n        doc = json.loads(f.read())\n        winnow.validate(doc)\n```\n\n## options\n\nSome winnow documents have a top level ```options``` attribute.  This object describes a related family of products by defining a set of possible configurations for a product, for example available colours or sizes. \n\n ```json\n {\n    \"options\":{\n        \"colour\": [\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"],\n        \"size\": [\"big\", \"small],\n        \"wheels\": [4, 6]\n     }\n     ...\n }\n ```\n\nThis describes the product family for a toy that comes in three colours, two sizes and can have either four or six wheels.

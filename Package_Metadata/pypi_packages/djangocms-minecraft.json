However, these changes also resulted in requiring your plugins to be reconfigured in \r\nedit mode after you have migrated the changes into your project from the update. Until you do this, they will be blank.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n------------\r\n\r\nInstall with pip:\r\n\r\n``pip install djangocms-minecraft``\r\n    \r\nOr, optionally, install the development version:\r\n    \r\n``pip install git+https://git@bitbucket.org/oddotterco/djangocms-minecraft.git#egg=djangocms-minecraft``\r\n\r\nThen, in your project's settings.py file, add 'djangocms_minecraft' to the INSTALLED_APPS like so:\r\n\r\n``INSTALLED_APPS += ('djangocms_minecraft',)``\r\n    \r\nFinally, perform syncdb and migrate on your project, as well as collectstatic to get all the supplied css and images\r\nfor this plugin.\r\n\r\nA note on CACHEing\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you configure caching on your server when using this plugin (and in general, really).  It really\r\nis not too complicated to set up basic caching.  The following is a *very basic* config example, just add it to your\r\nsettings.py project file to use your existing database backend as a cache server as well.::\r\n\r\n    # Enable plugin and content caching\r\n    # Don't forget to: ./manage.py createcachetable cache_data\r\n    CACHES = {\r\n        'default': {\r\n            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.db.DatabaseCache',\r\n            'LOCATION': 'cache_data',\r\n        },\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMinecraft Server Config\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nDon't forget to make sure that your web server has access to the ports that your Minecraft server is going to be\r\nanswering these queries on.  Typically this will be the same as the Minecraft game port (which is default 25565) for the\r\nstatus, query and plugins-list plugins.  For the RCON plugins, make sure that port (default is usually 25575) is open to\r\nthe web server from the game server as well.  Also, for all but the basic status plugin, you will need to configure the\r\ninecraft server to enable those services.  Query and RCON are both off by default ().  Look for details in the\r\ninecraft `Server.properties`_ wiki entry.\r\n\r\n.. _Server.properties: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties\r\n\r\nUSAGE\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSimply add the plugins to pages as desired. They will show up in both a text plugin's plugins-list as well as the\r\npage plugins-list, under the header \"Minecraft\".\r\n\r\nAlso included, for your use, is the commandline client provided by Dinnerbone. To use it, simply issue the command\r\n``mcquery`` and help-text will guide you.  Typical usage might be ``mcquery my_minecraft.server.net``.  Keep in mind that\r\nthe Minecraft server port needs to be accessible by the client issuing the command, *and* for the full query response,\r\nyou will also need to enable query mode on your Minecraft server.\r\n\r\nSUPPORT\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or ideas, or encounter bugs, add an entry to our\r\n`issue tracker`_.\r\n\r\n.. _issue tracker: https://bitbucket.org/oddotterco/djangocms-minecraft/issues\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n-------\r\n\r\nPublic domain - do what you will with this code.

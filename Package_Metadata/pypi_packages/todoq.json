The todo list should help users focus on work.\n2. The task management overhead should be minimized.\n\nPersonally I am a todo list enthusiast. Starting from paper and pencil when I\nwas in high school, I have been trying to use todo list to help me schedule my\nlife. I explored and used different methods and tools to help me track the\nstatus of daily tasks. Some of the tools are pretty cool, and I actually used\nthem for quite while. But from my experience, I found that I never kept using a\nsingle tool for more than two weeks. At first, I might be attracted to a tool\nand make up my mind for a resolution to make my life well-planed. But soon I\nfound that the tool does not actually help me much on focus and getting things\ndone, but the overhead to manage the todo list itself is pretty high.\n\nNow as a research assistant, a side-project developer and a student at the same\ntime. I use command-line tools quite a lot every day.  Sometimes I use web-based\ntodo list to help me track problems to solve, features to implement, or bugs to\nfix. But switching between command line and browser can be a pain sometimes, and\nlooks less professional. Such a switching could also be distracting sometimes.\n\nThen my friends and I decide to write a todo list tool for developers like us,\nbasically command-line everything guys =). We hope it could be really\nlight-wight, \"prevent\" over-managing task list, and help focus on work. So we\ncome up with the idea of single-task display todo list. Instead of displaying\nall the tasks, we simply show the top one, the one with the highest priority.\nOperations, like \"finish\", \"drop\", \"postpone\", are only limited to the top one\nto minimize the todo list management overhead. Tasks can still be listed with\nthe command \"peek\", which is highly not recommended. We hope users could just\nfocus on the top task at the moment, and thinking about other tasks only when\nabsolutely necessary.\n\nYou may find such a design may be inconvenient sometimes. You may want to\narrange the order of tasks, set a deadline for it, or simply drop some of them.\nThese operations are almost unsupported in TodoQ. Instead, for the order, we use\npriority (basically any unsigned int number between 0 and whatever python int\ntype supports). The tasks are ordered based on priority completely. We don't use\ndeadline for tasks. We believe that human mind should be able to transform\nurgency to priority easily, and for work, a good way to meet a deadline is to do\nit as early as possible.  You may want to drop some of tasks since you have\nfinished them, or they are not necessary any more, but why not do it later,\ncause managing todo list itself could also be \"viewed\" as a task with\nnot-the-highest priority.\n\nWe hope you could enjoy using TodoQ, and make it help you improve your valuable\nproductivity.\n\n## Install\n\nFirst-time install:\n\n    sudo pip install todoq\n\nUpdate:\n\n    sudo pip install todoq -U\n\nUninstall:\n\n    sudo pip uninstall todoq\n\n## Usage\n\n### Add a new task\n\n    todoq add task_name [priority]\n\nAdd a task into the current queue with the specified priority.\n\nExample #1\n\n    todoq add \"finish the front page UI design\" 999\n\ntask name - finish the front page UI design\npriority - 999\n\nExample #2\n\n    todoq add \"check email\"\n\ntask name - check email\npriority - 17 (default priority value)\n\n### Show the top task\n\n    todoq top\n\nDisplay the top task. Yes, you are right, just the top one task.\n\n### Finish the top task\n\n    todoq finish\n\nMark the top task as \"finished\".\n\n### Postpone the top task\n\n    todoq postpone [priority]\n\nIf `priority` is specified, the top task is postponed with the new priority.\nOtherwise, the top task is postponed after the second task.\n\n### Drop the top task\n\n    todoq drop\n\nMark the top task as \"dropped\".\n\n### Show the complete task list\n\n    todoq ls\n\nList all the tasks in the current queue.

Single queue is recommended. Multiple queues are provided\nin case you have multiple projects at hand.\n\n### Select a task queue\n\n    todoq selectq queue_name\n\nSelect the queue as the current queue.\n\n### Create a new task queue\n\n    todoq createq queue_name\n\nCreate a new queue.\n\n### Delete a task queue\n\n    todoq deleteq queue_name\n\nDelete an existing queue.\n\n### Show usage\n\n    todoq --help, todoq -h, todoq help\n\nShow help.

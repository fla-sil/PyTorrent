Please read this agreement. It applies to the software named above (\u201cSoftware\u201d), which includes the media on which you received it, if any. It also applies to any Microsoft:\r\n\u2022\tupdates,\r\n\u2022\tsupplements,\r\n\u2022\tdocumentation, and\r\n\u2022\tsupport services\r\nfor the Software, if provided, all of which are understood to be part of the Software unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.\r\nThis Software is intended to be used with Microsoft Kinect for Windows Software Development Kit (Kinect SDK).  Use of the Kinect SDK is subject to the license terms for that software.\r\nBy downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Software, you accept all terms in this agreement. If you do not accept them, you have no right to download, install, access, or use the Software. \u201cYou\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d means the individual who downloads, installs, accesses, or uses the Software (and, if you represent a legal entity, it also means that entity, and you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into this Agreement for that entity).\r\n\r\nIf you comply with all of the terms in this agreement, you have the rights below.\r\n1.\tINSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.\r\na.\tInstallation and Use. You may install and use up to five copies of the Software on your PC to design, develop, and test applications, programs, libraries, and modules that are enabled to run solely on the Windows platform (and not on any other platform) in connection with a Kinect\u2122 for Xbox 360 Sensor device (all of which are referred to, collectively, as \u201cApplications\u201d), and distribute your Applications, subject to the terms in this agreement.\r\nb.\tDistributable Source Code Samples. The Software may contain certain sample source code that is expressly labeled as \u201csample source\u201d or \u201csample code\u201d, contained in the directory \u201cSRC\\\u201d and all of its subdirectories, as installed with this Software, contained in any directory titled \u201csamples\\[SAMPLE NAME]\u201d,or otherwise listed in the file SAMPLES.TXT, if any such file is provided (all of which are referred to, collectively, as \u201cSample Code\u201d). You may copy and modify the Sample Code. You may also distribute the Sample Code (as well as your modifications of the Sample Code), but solely as part of your Applications, subject to the requirements and limitations of this agreement. You have no right to distribute any other portion of the Software.

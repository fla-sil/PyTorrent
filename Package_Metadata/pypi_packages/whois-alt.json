All you need is the Python standard library.\n\n## Instructions\n\nThe manual (including install instructions) can be found in the doc/ directory. A HTML version is also viewable [here](http://cryto.net/pythonwhois).\n\n## Goals\n\n* 100% coverage of WHOIS formats.\n* Accurate and complete data.\n* Consistently functional parsing; constant tests to ensure the parser isn't accidentally broken.\n\n## Features\n\n* WHOIS data retrieval\n\t* Able to follow WHOIS server redirects\n\t* Won't get stuck on multiple-result responses from verisign-grs\n* WHOIS data parsing\n\t* Base information (registrar, etc.)\n\t* Dates/times (registration, expiry, ...)\n\t* Full registrant information (!)\n\t* Nameservers\n* Optional WHOIS data normalization\n\t* Attempts to intelligently reformat WHOIS data for better (human) readability\n\t* Converts various abbreviation types to full locality names\n\t\t* Airport codes\n\t\t* Country names (2- and 3-letter ISO codes)\n\t\t* US states and territories\n\t\t* Canadian states and territories\n\t\t* Australian states\n* `pwhois`, a simple WHOIS tool using pythonwhois\n\t* Easily readable output format\n\t* Can also output raw WHOIS data\n\t* ... and JSON.\n* Automated testing suite\n\t* Will detect and warn about any changes in parsed data compared to previous runs\n\t* Guarantees that previously working WHOIS parsing doesn't unintentionally break when changing code\n\n## IP range WHOIS\n\n`pythonwhois` does not yet support WHOIS lookups on IP ranges (including single IPs), although this will be added at some point in the future. In the meantime, consider using [`ipwhois`](https://github.com/secynic/ipwhois) - it offers functionality and an API similar to `pythonwhois`, but for IPs. It also supports delegated RWhois.\n\nDo note that `ipwhois` does not offer a normalization feature, and does not (yet) come with a command-line tool. Additionally, `ipwhois` is maintained by Philip Hane and not by me; please make sure to file bugs relating to it in the `ipwhois` repository, not in that of `pythonwhois`.\n\n## Important update notes\n\n*2.4.0 and up*: A lot of changes were made to the normalization, and the performance under Python 2.x was significantly improved. The average parsing time under Python 2.7 has dropped by 94% (!), and on my system averages out at 18ms. Performance under Python 3.x is [unchanged](https://github.com/joepie91/python-whois/issues/27). `pythonwhois` will now expand a lot of abbreviations in normalized mode, such as airport codes, ISO country codes, and US/CA/AU state abbreviations. The consequence of this is that the library is now bigger (as it ships a list of these abbreviations). Also note that there *may* be licensing consequences, in particular regarding the airport code database. More information about that can be found below.\n\n*2.3.0 and up*: Python 3 support was fixed. Creation date parsing for contacts was fixed; correct timestamps will now be returned, rather than unformatted ones - if your application relies on the broken variant, you'll need to change your code. Some additional parameters were added to the `net` and `parse` methods to facilitate NIC handle lookups; the defaults are backwards-compatible, and these changes should not have any consequences for your code. Thai WHOIS parsing was implemented, but is a little spotty - data may occasionally be incorrectly split up. Please submit a bug report if you run across any issues.\n\n*2.2.0 and up*: The internal workings of `get_whois_raw` have been changed, to better facilitate parsing of WHOIS data from registries that may return multiple partial matches for a query, such as `whois.verisign-grs.com`. This change means that, by default, `get_whois_raw` will now strip out the part of such a response that does not pertain directly to the requested domain. If your application requires an unmodified raw WHOIS response and is calling `get_whois_raw` directly, you should use the new `never_cut` parameter to keep pythonwhois from doing this post-processing. As this is a potentially breaking behaviour change, the minor version has been bumped.\n\n## It doesn't work!\n\n* It doesn't work at all?\n* It doesn't parse the data for a particular domain?\n* There's an inaccuracy in parsing the data for a domain, even just a small one?\n\nIf any of those apply, don't hesitate to file an issue! The goal is 100% coverage, and we need your feedback to reach that goal.\n\n## License\n\nThis library may be used under the WTFPL - or, if you take issue with that, consider it to be under the CC0.\n\n## Data sources\n\nThis library uses a number of third-party datasets for normalization:\n\n* `airports.dat`: [OpenFlights Airports Database](http://openflights.org/data.html) ([Open Database License 1.0](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/), [Database Contents License 1.0](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1.0/))\n* `countries.dat`: [Country List](https://github.com/umpirsky/country-list) (MIT license)\n* `countries3.dat`: [ISO countries list](https://gist.github.com/eparreno/205900) (license unspecified)\n* `states_au.dat`: Part of `pythonwhois` (WTFPL/CC0)\n* `states_us.dat`: [State Table](http://statetable.com/) (license unspecified, free reuse encouraged)\n* `states_ca.dat`: [State Table](http://statetable.com/) (license unspecified, free reuse encouraged)\n\nBe aware that the OpenFlights database in particular has potential licensing consequences; if you do not wish to be bound by these potential consequences, you may simply delete the `airports.dat` file from your distribution. `pythonwhois` will assume there is no database available, and will not perform airport code conversion (but still function correctly otherwise). This also applies to other included datasets.\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to fork and submit pull requests (to the `develop` branch)! If you change any parsing or normalization logic, ensure to run the full test suite before opening a pull request.

It is provided as a CLI tool and\nPython 3.3+ module and supports Windows, Linux, and OSX.\n\nDploy's command `stow` creates symbolic links to the contents of source\ndirectories or packages in a specified destination directory. Repeating the\n`stow` command with the same arguments will confirm that the contents of the\npackage have been symbolically linked.\n\nDploy's command `unstow` removes symbolic links that resulted from `stow`\ncommands. Repeating the `unstow` command with the same arguments will confirm\nthat the links to stowed packages have been removed.\n\n## Installation\n* Latest Release: `pip install dploy`\n* Development Version: `pip install git+https://github.com/arecarn/dploy.git`\n\n## Basic CLI Usage\n* `dploy stow <source-directory>... <destination-directory>`\n* `dploy unstow <source-directory>... <destination-directory>`\n* `dploy --help`\n\n## Rational\nDploy started out as simple Python script to create symbolic links to my\ndotfiles for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Over time I keep improving and tweaking my\nscript to suit my needs, but I was running into a problem.  Keeping all the\nfiles I wanted to link in a config file was becoming a real pain in the neck.\n\nI started looking for another solution to solve my problem, and found many\nalternatives but none of them seemed to be a good fit. The solution that seemed\nthe most promising was using GNU Stow. It seemed like the most simple elegant\nsolution to the problem. The only issue was that it didn't support Windows.\n\nThen I thought to myself, why can't I just create my own version of Stow that\nwork on Windows, Linux and OSX. So after that my I started morphing\nsimple python script into what would become Dploy and learned a lot more about\npython in the process.\n\n## How does it compare with GNU Stow?\nBelow are just a few few major points of comparison between GNU stow and Dploy.\n\n- Like GNU Stow Dploy runs in two passes. First by collecting the actions\n  required to complete the command and verifying that the command can\n  completed without any issues. If no issues are detected then the second\n  pass executes these actions are execute to complete the command. Otherwise\n  Dploy will exit and indicate why the command can not be completed. This way a\n  stow or unstow operation is atomic and never partially done.\n\n- Like Stow, Dploy supports tree folding and tree unfolding.\n\n- Unlike Stow, Dploy requires an explicit source(s) and a destination\n  directory.\n\n- Unlike Stow, Dploy does not have any concept of ownership, but will only\n  operate on symbolic links and the creation or removal of directories for these\n  symbolic links.\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/arecarn/dploy/tarball/0.1.2", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/arecarn/dploy", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "dploy", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dploy/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dploy/", "project_urls": {"Download": "https://github.com/arecarn/dploy/tarball/0.1.2", "Homepage": "https://github.com/arecarn/dploy"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dploy/0.1.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Provides functionality similar to GNU Stow as a cross platform CLI tool and Python 3 module", "version": "0.1.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p># Dploy</p>\n<p>Dploy is a tool for creating symbolic links similarly to [GNU\nStow](<a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/</a>).

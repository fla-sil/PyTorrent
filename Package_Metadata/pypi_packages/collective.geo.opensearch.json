OpenSearch helps search engines and search\n        clients communicate by introducing a common set of formats to perform\n        search requests and syndicate search results. The OpenSearch description\n        document format can be used to describe a search engine so that it can\n        be used by search client applications. The OpenSearch response elements\n        can be used to extend existing syndication formats, such as RSS and\n        Atom, with the extra metadata needed to return search results\n        \n        collective.geo.opensearch enables you to syndicate the search results\n        of your plone site by formatting them in the RSS, Atom or KML formats,\n        augmented with OpenSearch response elements.\n        \n        Implemented extensions and conventions\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        \n        - opensearch\n        - relevance\n        - opensearch description for autodiscovery\n        - suggestions so that browsers can autocomplete\n        - response elements and first, previous, next, last links\n        - georss (for Atom and RSS Results)\n        \n        \n        Consume Open Search Feeds\n        -------------------------\n        \n        collective.geo.opensearch adds a view to the link type that lets you\n        search OpenSearch (or other searches that return RSS or Atom, pretty\n        much any other format feed parser supports and KML) compatible search\n        providers within your site. The feeds do not need to implement\n        the opensearch extensions it suffices that they are valid feeds. As\n        there is no way of knowing if the feed returns georss or KML you have to\n        choose 'Open Search Map View' manually for this link.\n        \n        You can combine several open search links as a metasearch. All OpenSearch\n        links inside a folder will be queried and their results displayed when\n        you change the view of a folder to 'Open Search Map View'\n        \n        Usage:\n        ------\n        \n        1) Display a map view of a georss RSS, Atom or KML search results\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        \n        Add a link content type that points to a remote (search) feed or KML.\n        You have to choose 'Open Search Map View' manually for this link.\n        \n        georss feeds will be converted into a html search result and a kml\n        map layer. kml sources will be passed on 'as is' (the description\n        is passed through htmllaundry) and the name and description of the placemarks\n        displayed as search results.\n        \n        The view consits of a simple searchform, the map displaying the georss\n        or kml information and the results of the query\n        \n        2) search multiple sources at once\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        \n        To build a simple metasearch create a folder and add your query links to it.\n        Change the view of the folder to 'Open Search Map View'.\n        The view consist of a search form (currently only for full text search)\n        which input will be applied to all open search links (i.e. any link\n        that has 'Open Search Map View' set as its view). The results of\n        the searches will be displayed as layers in the map and in tabs beneath\n        the form. The queries are executed asynchronously via AJAX, so you do\n        not have to wait until the last query has finished.\n        \n        Abusing collective.geo.opensearch to Display miscelaneous Feeds and KMLs\n        ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        \n        3) Display an abritary 'static' feed or a remote KML Files\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        \n        Allthough the main focus of this product is to produce and display\n        search feeds you may use it to display any valid feed.

Add ``djembe`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.\n\n#. Create its model tables with ``manage.py migrate djembe``.\n\n#. To use it as your default email backend, add this setting::\n\n    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'djembe.backends.EncryptingSMTPBackend'\n\n#. To use a cipher other than the default AES-256, specify it in\n   settings.DJEMBE_CIPHER::\n\n    DJEMBE_CIPHER = 'des_ede3_cbc'  # triple DES\n\n   The intersection of M2Crypto's ciphers and RFC 3851 are:\n\n   * ``des_ede3_cbc`` (required by the RFC)\n   * ``aes_128_cbc`` (recommended, not required, by the RFC)\n   * ``aes_192_cbc`` (recommended, not required, by the RFC)\n   * ``aes_256_cbc`` (recommended, not required, by the RFC)\n   * ``rc2_40_cbc`` (RFC requires support, but it's weak -- don't use it)\n\n   RFC 5751 requires AES-128, and indicates that higher key lengths are of\n   course the future. It marks tripleDES with \"SHOULD-\", meaning it's on its\n   way out.\n\n   The following mail clients have worked fine with AES-256 in my testing.\n\n   * Mail.app 6.2 (Mac)\n   * Thunderbird 17 (Mac, Linux)\n   * Windows Live Mail (Windows 7)\n\n   I'd recommend you try the default and fall back to 3DES if necessary.\n\n#. Use the Django admin to add recipients that should receive encrypted mail.\n\n   The simplest case is an Identity with a certificate. Any mail sent to that\n   Identity will be encrypted.\n\n   To create signing Identities, supply both a certificate and a private key --\n   which must not have a passphrase, obviously. Any mail sent *from* the\n   Identity's address will be signed with the private key.\n\n   You can create multiple Identity records with the same address, but\n   different certificates. This is how you encrypt mail to an alias or mailing\n   list.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nThe project is on Github_. If you find a bug or have a feature request, please\nadd an issue there. Patches or pull requests are of course welcome, too. I\nwon't even make you add tests; just make sure you don't break what's already\nthere -- you can check by running ``python setup.py test`` in your working\ncopy.\n\n.. _Github: https://github.com/cabincode/django-djembe/", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/cabincode/django-djembe", "keywords": null, "license": "UNKNOWN", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "django-djembe", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-djembe/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-djembe/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://github.com/cabincode/django-djembe"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/django-djembe/0.2.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A Django email backend that encrypts outgoing mail with S/MIME.", "version": "0.2.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>A Django email backend that encrypts outgoing mail with S/MIME.</p>\n<div id=\"features\">\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p>It automatically encrypts messages to recipients for whom certificates are\navailable, falling back to cleartext for any recipients that don\u2019t have\ncertificates on file.</p>\n<p>Add certificates for the addresses in settings.ADMINS and you can relax (a\nlittle) about emailing notifications, Django error reports, or other\npotentially sensitive information.</p>\n<p>It supports multiple certificates per recipient address, so you can define\nADMINS as an alias, configure each recipient\u2019s address and certificate and\nthey\u2019ll all be able to read the messages.</p>\n<p>If a private key is associated with a sending address, messages from that\nsender will also be signed.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"license\">\n<h2>License</h2>\n<p>You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for\ncommercial purposes, all without asking permission.</p>\n<p>To the extent possible under law, the author(s) have dedicated all\ncopyright and related and neighboring rights to this software to the\npublic domain worldwide.

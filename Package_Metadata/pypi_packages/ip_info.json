Similar to sites like whatismyip.com, but without all the clutter and\ncrap.\n\nDependencies\n------------\nYou need the python libraries flask, whelk, publicsuffix and GeoIP. These can\nbe installed with your OS' package manager or with pip. You also need a working\n`whois` program on your `$PATH`.\n\nUbuntu users can install these packages with:\n\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dennis/python\n    sudo apt-get install python-whelk python-flask python-publicsuffix python-geoip whois\n\nUsage\n-----\nUsing the built-in flask/werkzeug http daemon, you can quickly run it in demo mode:\n\n    python -m ip_info\n\nI would however recommend using a wsgi daemon such as uwsgi and a proper httpd\nlike nginx as frontend. \n\nConfiguration examples\n----------------------\nExample nginx configuration:\n\n    server {\n        listen 80;\n        listen  [::]:80;\n\n        root /usr/share/nginx/www;\n        index index.html index.htm;\n\n        server_name ip.seveas.net;\n\n        try_files $uri @uwsgi;\n        location @uwsgi {\n            include uwsgi_params;\n            uwsgi_pass unix:/run/uwsgi/app/ip_info/socket;\n        }\n    }\n\n\nExample uwsgi configuration:\n\n    [uwsgi]\n    plugins       = python\n    module        = ip_info:app\n    env           = IP_SETTINGS=/etc/ip_settings\n    env           = HOME=/nonexistent\n\n    shared-socket = 1\n    chown_socket  = www-data\n    log-reopen    = 1\n\n    processes     = 10\n    harakiri      = 60\n    max-requests  = 20\n    reload-on-as  = 1024\n    auto-procname = 1\n    procname-prefix-spaced = ip_info\n\nThe `IP_SETTINGS` environment variable can be used to point to a configuration\nfile. This configuration file can be used to set any Flask setting you want.\nip\\_info itself only has one setting: A `DB` variable that can point to a\ncuston GeoIP data file, such as the data file that contains city information.\n\nLicense\n-------\nCopyright (c) 2014 Dennis Kaarsemaker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

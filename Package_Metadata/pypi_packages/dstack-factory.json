If a python package is already available as wheel package, it is cached. Otherwise the source is downloaded from pip, git or any other source supported by pip and compiled/packaged as a wheel file.\n\nExamples of python packages that currently still need to be build are:\n   - psycopg2\n   - lxml\n   - pycrypto\n   - pillow\n   - weasyprint (and it's dependencies)\n   - anything hosted on GitHub, e.g. forks of python packages or unreleased versions\n\n``runtime`` is a base docker image that contains all the necessary libraries to run most popular python packages with external dependencies. For example pandas, matplotlib, weasyprint, etc. all require non-python libraries.\nIn addition to the base runtime docker image, ``dstack-factory`` also provides three entry point Dockerfiles to support different workflows for building and deploying docker and python based applications.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe documentation can be found at: https://pythonhosted.org/dstack-factory/\n\n\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": "https://pythonhosted.org/dstack-factory/", "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/obitec/dstack-factory", "keywords": "docker python wheels images runtime automation", "license": "MIT License", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "dstack-factory", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dstack-factory/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dstack-factory/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/obitec/dstack-factory"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/dstack-factory/1.0.7/", "requires_dist": ["invoke", "python-dotenv (>=0.5.1)", "setuptools-scm", "Sphinx (>=1.4.1); extra == 'dev'", "invoke (>=0.13.0); extra == 'dev'", "python-dotenv (>=0.5.1); extra == 'dev'", "setuptools-scm; extra == 'dev'", "wheel (>=0.29.0); extra == 'dev'", "coverage; extra == 'test'"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "CLI that accompanies dstack-factory for building and publishing docker images for python packages.", "version": "1.0.7", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>dstack-factory consists of two components: (1) <tt>factory</tt> and (2) <tt>runtime</tt>.</p>\n<p><tt>factory</tt> is a service that builds (or downloads) python wheels from a pip requirements file or from a wheel package uploaded to the wheelhouse.

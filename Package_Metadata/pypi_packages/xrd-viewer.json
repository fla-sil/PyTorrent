Click the `Edit regions...` button to open the extended region editor. By default it has two regions. The first region is the background region and all regions afterwards are ROIs. By default the second region (= the first ROI) is the active region. The active region is displayed as red rectangle and can be manipulated by moving the edges to the desired positions. The region editor can also be used to refine the region (values are in pixels).

You can move it to the upper left corner with an width and length of 1. (In this corner is typically a shadow in the measurements, so zero counts.)\n* You can move the cursor in the bottom plot my draging the mouse. The upper plot gets updated. This also sets the focus on the frame slider, so you can move the cursor by pressing left and right.\n* Typically the first frames of a measurement are corrupted, you can set an value in the bottom input box to ignore them.\n* After selecting a measurement `File > Save Graph...` becomes enabled. You can save the current analysis plot as image in `*.JPG`,`*.PNG` or `*.PDF` format (the cursor and indicator will be removed) or as plain text `*.TXT` for further analysis. The plain text file will have some metadata about the measurement file, the mask file and the selected regions.", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://gitlab.com/merrx/xrd-viewer", "keywords": "analysis,diffraction", "license": "", "maintainer": "Sebastian Schenk", "maintainer_email": "sebastian.schenk@physik.uni-halle.de", "name": "xrd-viewer", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/xrd-viewer/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/xrd-viewer/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://gitlab.com/merrx/xrd-viewer"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/xrd-viewer/1.0.0/", "requires_dist": ["PyQt5 (>=5.0,<6.0)", "matplotlib (>=3.0,<4.0)", "h5py (>=2.9,<3.0)", "numpy (>=1.15,<2.0)"], "requires_python": ">=3.6,<4.0", "summary": "Simple analysis tool for NeXus data files", "version": "1.0.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>xrd-viewer</h1>\n<p>Simple analysis tool for NeXus data files measured at the SIXS beamline at synchrotron Soleil. <br>\nWritten in Python with Qt5 Gui</p>\n<h1>Installation</h1>\n<p>Please install the <code>python3-pyqt5</code> package of your distribution and then run <br>\n<code>pip install xrd-viewer</code><br></p>\n<p>then start the program by running <code>xrd-viewer</code></p>\n<h1>Usage</h1>\n<p>Once you opened the program, you will be greeted by the default interface with an logo on the top plot and an empty plot on the bottom.</p>\n<p>The (optional) first step is to <strong>load a mask file</strong> via <code>File &gt; Load Mask...</code>\nAfter file selection a preview of the mask file is presented on the upper plot.

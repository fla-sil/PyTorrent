Unlike\nthe other SCPLibrary ('robotframework-scplibrary'), this one works\nhand in hand with the Robot SSHLibrary (hence\n'robotframework-scpcompat').\n\nI wrote this because I was frustrated that the non-compatible\nSCPLibrary overwrote some SSHLibrary keywords and managed connections\nitself. I did consider changing the existing library, but that would\nbreak it for existing users.\n\nTo recap, the main differences are:\n\n- Relies on the standard SSHLibrary to manage connections\n- ``Download File`` and ``Upload File`` keywords use the currently\n  active SSH connection to transfer files to the remote host\n- Does not conflict with any SSHLibrary keywords\n- Can even use an existing connection used for other SSH commands\n\nIt is operating system independent, but has only been tested with\nPython. Strictly speaking, the underlying 'scp' module is also pure\nPython, so let me know if you have any luck with Jython or\nIronPython.\n\nSSHLibrary is open source software licensed under `GNU General Public\nLicense v3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`__.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nWhen installing SCPLibrary on UNIX-like machines with Python, the\neasiest approach is using `pip <http://pip-installer.org>`__::\n\n    pip install robotframework-scpcompat\n\nNote while this library supports both Python 2 and 3, SSHLibrary does\nnot. So until SSHLibrary fixes `issue #144\n<https://github.com/robotframework/SSHLibrary/issues/144>`__ it\ndoesn't make sense to use Python 3. Hopefully though, once it's\nresolved this library should also work with Python 3.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe library is self-documenting via docstrings; additionally you can\nfind an example robot script in this repository.

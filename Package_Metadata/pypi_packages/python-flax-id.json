It is divisible by 6, so can be rendered as base64-encoded string without\npadding\n2. It is divisible by 8, so it can be represented as a byte array\n3. It leaves enough room for the random part\n\nWe save some space on the timestamp component by using a custom epoch start\n(we start on 2015-01-01), which allows us to use 40 bits, instead of 42 to\nrepresent the timestamp for the next 30+ years.\n\n\n    Here is the structure of the example id:\n\n    | 00000      10111001010010101010101001010001111   01110110100000001100101110001011101110011011110111000001 |\n    | (padding)             timestamp                |                        randomness                        |\n    |                  40                            |                            56                            |\n\n    (Padding is necessary when there is less than 40 bits in the timestamp, e.g. the elapsed time since the epoch\n     is still relatively small)\n\n    And here is the rendering with our modified Base64 alphabet:\n\n    000001 011100 101001 010101 010100 101000 111101 110110 100000 001100 101110 001011 101110 011011 110111 000001\n       0      R      d      K      J      c      x      q      V      B      i      A      i      Q      r      0\n\n### Representation\n\nThe canonical representation of the Flax ID is Base64-encoded, URL safe string\n(16 characters).\nWe're using the slightly modified Base64 alphabet, which gives us the\nguaranteed lexicographical ordering of the strings thus produced (Firebase does\nthe same)\n\n    \"-0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n\n### The algorithm\n\nThe algorithm is defined as follows:\n\n1. Take a timestamp, as a number of milliseconds since the beginning of our\nepoch\n2. Combine it, by means of left binary shift with 56 random bits\n3. Represent the number as binary string, applying padding, if necessary, so\nthe total number of bits is 96\n4. Encode the binary string using the Base64 alphabet above, taking each 6\nbits to represent a number\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ pip install python-flax-id\n\n## Development\n\n### Running tests\n\nAs usual run:\n\n    $ make test\n\n### Publishing new release\n\nTo publish new release you need to,\n\n1. Bump version number according to [SemVer](http://semver.org/) in\n   `flax_id/__init__.py` file and put a log into *ChangeLog* section below\n2.

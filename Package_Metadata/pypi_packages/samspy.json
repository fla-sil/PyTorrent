0.0.2\n\n*SamsPy* is a collection of simple aerospace models in Python.\n(Anyway, that's the plan.)\n\nIt has been developed on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04, now 16.04)\nand Mac OS X (Mavericks, now Sierra)\nusing Python 3 and the corresponding YAML and Nose packages.\n\nMore details are given in the file ``docs/overview.rst``.\nAn initial example is given in ``docs/examples/lvbasic.rst``.\nThis example deals with simple modeling of a prototype launch vehicle.\n(Note: these were written for SamsPy v0.0.1.)\n\nA major goal of version 0.0.2 has been to make SamsPy installable\nby ``pip``, the standard Python package installation program.\nAs a result, there has been significant re-arrangement of the\nPython source files between v0.0.1 and v0.0.2.\n\nThe ``cmds`` directory includes a couple of executable commands.\n``lvbasic.py`` executes the simple launch vehicle modeling described above.\n``sto.py`` computes performance characteristics for utilizing a\nsuper-synchronous transfer orbit to eventually reach geostationery orbit.\n\nNotes for version 0.0.2\n-----------------------\n\n``lvbasic`` is now installed by ``pip`` as an executable command.\nWhen so installed, and example YAML files are copied into\nthe current directory, typical execution of the command looks something like ::\n\n    lvbasic vehicle.yaml propellants.yaml\n\nThe example files can be found under ``site-packages/samspy/share`` or\non Github at: ``https://github.com/kwan0xfff/SamsPy``.\n(Early versions have the files under ``share``;\nlater ones under ``samspy/share``.)",

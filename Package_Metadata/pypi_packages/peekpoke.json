{"info": {"author": "Chris Siedell", "author_email": "chris@siedell.com", "bugtrack_url": null, "classifiers": ["Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License", "Programming Language :: Python :: 3"], "description": "# PeekPoke\nStatus: _experimental_\n\nPeekPoke is a tool for reading and writing a Propeller's hub memory from a PC. It consists of two parts: a Python module for sending commands from the PC, and a Propeller program for responding to commands.\n\nThe Python module has methods to read and write hub memory as bytes, strings, integers, and lists of integers.\n\nThe Propeller program can be configured to restrict reads and writes to specific ranges, or to disable writes altogether.\n\nPeekPoke has these additional features:\n- the PAR register may be used to pass a value to the PC,\n- the PC can set the baudrate remotely,\n- the PC can reset the baudrate with a break condition,\n- the Propeller can support baudrates as fast as 26 clocks per bit period,\n- there is a four-byte `identifier` constant that can read by the PC,\n- a four-byte `token` variable is 0 on launch and can be set by the PC,\n- the PC can send PASM code to be executed (disabled by default),\n- the Propeller program is completely cog-contained after launch.\n\n## Installation\n\nPeekPoke requires Python 3. It can be installed with the command `pip install peekpoke`, or the package may be downloaded from <https://pypi.org/project/peekpoke/>.  PeekPoke also requires the <https://pypi.org/project/crow-serial/> and <https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/> packages (pip automatically handles these dependencies).\n\nTo run PeekPoke on the Propeller include `PeekPoke.spin`  in your project, and use the Spin methods to set up and launch a PeekPoke instance. The latest version of `PeekPoke.spin` can be found at <https://github.com/chris-siedell/PeekPoke>.\n\n## Documentation\n\nPython: https://github.com/chris-siedell/PeekPoke/wiki/PeekPoke-Python-Documentation\n\nSpin: https://github.com/chris-siedell/PeekPoke/wiki/PeekPoke-Spin-Documentation", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://siedell.com/projects/PeekPoke", "keywords": "Parallax Propeller P8X32A", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "peekpoke", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/peekpoke/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/peekpoke/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://siedell.com/projects/PeekPoke", "Python Documentation": "https://github.com/chris-siedell/PeekPoke/wiki/PeekPoke-Python-Documentation", "Source": "https://github.com/chris-siedell/PeekPoke", "Spin Documentation": "https://github.com/chris-siedell/PeekPoke/wiki/PeekPoke-Spin-Documentation"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/peekpoke/0.6.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3", "summary": "Remote hub memory tool for the Propeller microcontroller.", "version": "0.6.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>PeekPoke</h1>\n<p>Status: <em>experimental</em></p>\n<p>PeekPoke is a tool for reading and writing a Propeller's hub memory from a PC.

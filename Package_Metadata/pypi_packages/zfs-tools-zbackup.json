You\n  will use `zreplicate` for that (see below for examples).\n\n- After the first replication, you may want to set the `mountpoint`\n  attributes on the received datasets so they do not automount\n  on the backup machine.\n\n### Test\n\nIf all went well, you should be able to do this without issue:\n\n(on the machine to back up)\n\n    [root@peter]\n    zsnap senderpool\n\n(on the machine to receive)\n\n    [root@paul]\n    zfs create receiverpool/senderpool # <--- run this ONLY ONCE\n    zreplicate -o zfs@paul:senderpool receiverpool/senderpool\n    # this should send the entire senderpool with all snapshots\n    # over from peter to paul, placing it in receiverpool/senderpool\n\n(on the machine to back up)\n\n    [root@peter]\n    zsnap senderpool\n\n(on the machine to receive)\n\n    [root@paul]\n    zreplicate -o zfs@paul:senderpool receiverpool/senderpool\n    # this should send an incremental stream of senderpool\n    # into receiverpool/senderpool\n\nAnd that's it, really.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/tesujimath/zfs-tools-zbackup", "keywords": "ZFS filesystems backup synchronization snapshot", "license": "GPL", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "zfs-tools-zbackup", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zfs-tools-zbackup/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zfs-tools-zbackup/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://github.com/tesujimath/zfs-tools-zbackup"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zfs-tools-zbackup/0.5.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=2.7, <3", "summary": "ZFS synchronization and snapshotting tools", "version": "0.5.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p># ZFS tools</p>\n<p><em>This repo has diverged from the upstream\n[Rudd-O/zfs-tools](http://github.com/Rudd-O/zfs-tools), as described\n[here](https://github.com/Rudd-O/zfs-tools/issues/25).

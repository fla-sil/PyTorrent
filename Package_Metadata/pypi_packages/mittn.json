It uses Python and Behave.\n\nThe idea is that security people or developers can define a hardening\ntarget using a human-readable language, in this case, Gherkin.\n\nThe rationale is:\n\n- Once the initial set of tests is running in test automation, new\n  security test cases can be added based on existing ones without\n  having to understand exactly how the tools are set up and run.\n\n- Existing functional tests can be reused to drive security tests.\n\n- Test tools are run automatically in Continuous Integration, catching\n  regression and low-hanging fruit, and helping to concentrate\n  exploratory security testing into areas where it has a better\n  bang-for-buck ratio.\n\nMittn was originally inspired by Gauntlt (http://gauntlt.org/). You\nmight also want to have a look at BDD-Security\n(http://www.continuumsecurity.net/bdd-intro.html) that is a pretty\nawesome system for automating security testing, and offers similar\nfunctionality with OWASP Zaproxy.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nExact installation varies by the test tool you want to use. See the\ndocs/ directory for detailed instructions.\n\n  NOTE: Backwards compatibility of false positive databases has been\n  broken.

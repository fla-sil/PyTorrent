This was chosen to avoid reliance on other tools.\n\n- **Create custom tests** - Because tests are written in Python, custom written tests can be ran by simply dropping a file in a folder. These tests are not limited; a test can do anything Python can do.\n\n- **Fully scalable** - A test can include one instance or hundreds. A couple lines of configuration can drastically change the stress put on OpenStack hardware.\n\n- **Test across OpenStack environments** - Have multiple OpenStack environments or regions? Run tests across them to see performance metrics when they interact.\n\n- **Run tests in an order or all at once** - See single metric results such as network throughput or see how a high network throughput can affect network latency.\n\n- **JSON and YAML support** - Use a mix of JSON or YAML for both configuration and results\n\n## Docker Image Tags\n\nCloudPunch is available as the Docker image `target/cloudpunch`\n\n- `latest` - follows the CloudPunch master branch (latest stable version of CloudPunch)\n- `dev` - follows the CloudPunch dev branch (latest unstable version of CloudPunch)\n- `1.5.0` - CloudPunch release 1.5.0\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (C) 2017 Target Brands, Inc.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

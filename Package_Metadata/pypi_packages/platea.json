In addition to being a stats nerd I am also a history wonk. When writing this package I was reminded of a story in Thucydides' \"History of the Peloponnesian War\" where the Athenians needed to estimate the height of the walls surrounding Platea in order to know how high to make their siege ladders. The Athenians counted the number of bricks at a number of unplastered sections of wall and used the mode of these counts and the estimated height of a brick to approximate the height of the walls. This is one of the earliest recorded applications of \"statistics\" (5th Century BC).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.\n\n### Installing\n\nFor a local installation, first git clone this repository. Then follow these instructions:\n\n```\npip install .\n```\n\nTo install from pypi:\n\n```\npip install -U platea\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nTesting is an important part of creating maintainable, production grade code. Below are instructions for running unit and style tests as well as installing the necessary testing packages. Tests have intentionally been separated from the installable pypi package for a variety of reasons.\n\nMake sure you have the required testing packages:\n\n```\npip install -r requirements_test.txt\n```\n\nYou will also need to build the package extensions in place:\n\n```\npython setup.py build_ext --inplace\n```\n\n### Running the unit tests\n\nWe use the pytest framework for unit testing.\n\n```\npytest -vvl -s --cov platea --disable-pytest-warnings\n```\n\n### Running the style tests\n\nHaving neat and legible code is important. Having documentation is also important. We use pylint as our style guide framework. Many of our naming conventions follow directly from the literary sources they come from. This makes it easier to read the mathematical equations and see how they translate into the code. This sometimes forces us to break pep8 conventions for naming.\n\n```\npylint platea --disable=invalid-name\n```\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nA big thank you to Keegan Hines who first recommended the book \"Numerical Recipes\" to me. Another big thank you to Mack Sweeney who has shaped much of my appreciation for code styling and standards. Finally, thanks to Greg Sinclair for being a sounding board and source of advice as I worked on this package.\n\n## Literary References\n\nBook References:\n1.

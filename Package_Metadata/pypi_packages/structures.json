Make a pull request with an example of structure that confuses you.\nThis way we will improve the docs and examples so another person won't be confused.\nAnd they won't need to dig through issues to see if their question has already been answered.\n\nYou think you have found a bug? Make a pull request describing a buggy structure.\nIf you are courage enough, feel free to also submit a bug fix :)\n\nYou have a feature request? Make a pull request briefly describing your feature.\nThis can be a class with a (failing) example in its docstring.\nEven if it's not valid python code - your example will help to understand the intention.\nHaving an initial implementation of your feature will greatly reduce the time needed to make your feature appear in the next release.\n\nA detailed guide on how to contribute can be found in `CONTRIBUTING.rst <https://github.com/malinoff/structures/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.9.2\n-----\n\n* Changed Contextual so now it accepts a single function that must produce \\*args\n* Fixed a couple of performance issues\n* Added BitFields construct\n* Improved docstrings with more example\n* Increased tests coverage\n\n0.9.1\n-----\n\n* Fix description rendering and links on pypi\n\n0.9\n---\n\nInitial public release.\n\nApache License\n==============\n\nVersion 2.0, January 2004, http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n1.

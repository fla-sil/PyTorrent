Actions are now taken inside setter methods.\nupdated: added readyImage flag to check if selected image is preloaded\nupdated: listDir and image requests are now retried when fail\nfixed: some buttons now Select are now available even if there are no images in current path\nnew: loading image for listDir request added\nfixed: loading bar was showing wrong values; image cant be changed while previously is being loaded\nupdated: dont allow path changes when isLoading()\nnew: images service. image cache is now controlled in specific service. (code updated to use it)\nupdated: files_paths is now returned from list dir view.\nupdated: variables renamed to camelCase\nupdated: .basket is now a list of full_path's\nupdated: listdir returns 404 when unknown directory\nupdated: $scope.image is a string again, to obey single-source-of-truth ($scope.images)\nupdated: refreshImage() now loads cache when needed; fixed: nav_path doesnt add empty entry when / is last character; updated: buttonsare hidden when loading or no image in current path\nupdated: metadata is no longer created inside stream_image for performance; logging added\nupdated: metadata is only loaded when image is loaded;\nupdated: when page section is changed, deferred received images are discarded\nupdated: images are now structured in an JS object\nnew: preloading thums with progress bar\nnew: previous and next buttons for easy navigation\nupdated: $scope.image is an object now\nupdated: bool variables to control loading created.\nupdated: keypress event captured to handle left and right keys.\nupdated: split app.js into js files\nupdated: manage panel, nav pills used for directories again\nnew: polling routine\nupdate: app.js: path variable doesnt allow '//' anymore (should fix Windows problems)\n\n\n0.7\n---\n- mongodb is no longer mandatory. sqlite interface is available.\n- new cli, without the need of ini files to start dirshare.\n- new: data access interface class used for multiple dbs support\n- new: sqlite data access implementation complete\n- new: cli is now a module. New cli app with waitress http server, without pastedeploy ini\n- updated: unit tests cover all data access methods, both mongodb and sqlite\n- updated: variables renamed.

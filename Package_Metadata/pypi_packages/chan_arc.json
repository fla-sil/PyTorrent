This disjoined nature of the backup formats makes it difficult to transport thread dumps from one supplier to another, and even more difficult if you're looking to work with a bunch of different thread archives.\n\nThis is an attempt to standardize a file format that can be used to archive and store threads from all sorts of image boards. This should make it easier to create a tool that backs up threads, meaning we don't need to redo the same work of creating a format for our specific tool to use, and that everyone's archives can be imported and exported to a single, format.\n\nThe draft specification is available at `chan-arc-spec.rst <chan-arc-spec.rst>`_.\n\nLicense\n-------\nThe specification itself, as well as any reference code or libraries hosted here, are released into the public domain listed below::\n\n    This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\n\n    Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or\n    distribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled\n    binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any\n    means.\n\n    In jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors\n    of this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the\n    software to the public domain.

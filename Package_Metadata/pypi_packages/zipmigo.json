Over the course of a project, she found herself constantly reusing code snippets - a sign that one should wrap it up into a script. However, she was working in google colab, which was designed for collaborative notebook workflows. It seemed that distributing a package on PyPi was the easiest way to import a script into colab for her audience, and thus zipmigo was born.\n\n### Installation\nZipmigo is available for commandline installation from PyPi via `pip install zipmigo`.\n\n#### Google Colab\nRun `!pip install zipmigo`  \n\nOr, as of February 2020, to pull in Zipmigo *directly from github*;\n```sh\n!curl --remote-name \\\n     -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw' \\\n     --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaszklar/zipmigo/master/zipmigo.py\n```\n\n### Examples\n#### Importing\nIf you installed via pip:  \n`from zipmigo import zipmigo`  \nIf you are working from the source file:  \n`import zipmigo`  \n\n#### Download a zip file\nDownload a file to the current working directory. The status of the connection and the progress of the download will be printed out.\n\n```python  \nzipmigo.download(\"https://geo.nyu.edu/download/file/harvard-ntadcd106-shapefile.zip\", 'congressdistricts.zip')\n```\n\n#### Print out the contents of the current working directory & subdirectories\n```python\nzipmigo.list_dir()\n```\n\n#### Unzip\nUnpack zip file into current directory. If the archive has only directories in the root, those directories will be placed in the current working directory.\n\n```python\nzipmigo.unzip(\"congressdistricts.zip\")\n```\n\n### Release History\n[1.0.1] 2020.05.05  \nSome error handling and type assertions  \nCorrect readme instructions  \n\n[1.0.0] 2020.02.13  \nInitial Release :tada:  \n\n### Future features?\n* Inspect zip archive prior to opening\n* Extract a single file from the archive\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/kaszklar/zipmigo", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "zipmigo", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zipmigo/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zipmigo/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/kaszklar/zipmigo"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zipmigo/1.0.1/", "requires_dist": ["tqdm (>=4.38)", "requests (>=2.22.0)"], "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "Simple package to download & unzip archives within notebooks.", "version": "1.0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Zipmigo</h1>\n<p>Zipmigo is intended to assist fledgling data analysts and scientists with the process of downloading a zip file via http and unzipping it into the working directory when working in a notebook environment, saving them time and energy wading through <code>os</code>, <code>requests</code>, and running shell commands to inspect the directory structure.</p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>This package was born of the author's hatred for recursive folders within zip files, as well as her need to use the same commands over and over again to download &amp; unpack zip archives.

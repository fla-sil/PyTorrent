AttachmentField is a product for Plone/Archetypes content types developers.\n\n* It is *strongly* discouraged to uninstall AttachmentField while configured to use FileSystemStorage. If so, all contents that use AttachmentField would be lost (even if you reinstall it later). If you want to upgrade, just reinstall it without uninstalling it.\n\nIf you need to uninstall AttachmentField, first configure it to use AttributeStorage (in ZODB) (default choice). In this case, you can then uninstall AttachmentField without loosing your content (You will need to reinstall a version of AttachmentField to access them again)\n\nDependencies\n############\n\nPython packages\n===============\n\n* python-libxml2\n\n* python-libxslt\n\nYou need these packages for OpenOffice documents support.\n\nThese Python extensions are available as packages in most Linux\ndistros.

It's, then,\n  Archetypes-dependent.\n\n* ZAAPlugins is no longer necessary. All AF plugins are integrated\n  directly into the AF product.\n\n* AF offers a convenient plugin structure, allowing you to create\n  plugins with only 10 lines of code. Doing so, we've lost a little\n  bit of the flexibility we never needed ;) However it's still\n  possible to override the AttachmentHandler class to offer more\n  flexibility (AttachmentHandler is the new name for\n  AbstractAttachment).\n\n* A plugin is now a singleton providing indexing & preview & iconing\n  services. No more polymorphism as in ZAA (in ZAA, each and every\n  attachement stored an instance of a plugin class, which turned out\n  to be too complicated for the actual need).\n\n* A side effect of the preceding point is that you can upload invalid\n  files to your server and develop (or configure) new plugins AFTER\n  you've uploaded 'em. AF will dynamically detect the new content type\n  and will provide preview and indexing support magically. With that\n  feature, customers can start populating a website very early in the\n  process!\n\n* AF doesn't support images in MSWord preview yet (it will !)\n\n* AF doesnt' store attachments preview nor searchable text in ZODB;\n  they are cached though, and will normally be calculated only once\n  per Zope program run.

For example, some subreddits require you to pass the cookie \"over18=1\".\n\nThe option can be passed several times to inject multiple cookies.\n\n    --next-page-xpath HTML_XPATH\n\nimg-lurker can handle pagination for sites where a gallery contains so many\nimages that the site is split in numbered pages.\n`HTML_XPATH` should be an XPath expression locating the HTML link to the \"next\npage\".\nIf this argument is given, after downloading all images of a \"page\", img-lurker\nwill follow the link pointed to by `HTML_XPATH` and repeat on the next page.\n\nWarning: this can issue a lot of traffic for huge galleries. Be cautious or you\nmight get blocked by the website.\n\n    --history-file FILE\n\nMark all downloaded images URLs in this file and avoid redownloading URLs\npresent in this file.\nUseful when running img-lurker multiple times on the same gallery, typically if\nthe gallery has received fresh images. Also useful if you use\n`--next-page-xpath` option and kill img-lurker to avoid flooding the site, make\na pause (minutes? hours? days?) then restart img-lurker: the history file will\nhelp it resume where it was interrupted.\n\nThis makes the assumption that each image has a URL that is unique (the image\nURL always have the same URL, e.g. no varying tokens, etc.) and\nconversely (the URLs will not point to another image at some point, e.g. the\nimages are NOT numbered in ascending order (else \"1.jpg\" would point to\ndifferent images over time)).\n\n    --min-thumb-size WIDTHxHEIGHT\n    --min-image-size WIDTHxHEIGHT\n\nMinimum size for an image to be considered a thumbnail worth following or an\nimage worth downloading. Useful not to download navigation buttons, logos, etc.\nDefault values are `--min-thumb-size=128x128` and `--min-image-size=400x400`.\n\n    --max-aspect-ratio WIDTH:HEIGHT\n\nMaximum ratio between WIDTH and HEIGHT (or HEIGHT on WIDTH, img-lurker is smart\nenough to figure out) to consider an image is worth downloading.\n\nFor example, pass \"16:9\" and img-lurker will accept images with dimensions\n1920x1080 or 1080x1920 as they are respectively 16:9 and 9:16 but also 1600x1200\nor 1200x1600 because they are 4:3 (and 3:4) which is lower (more looking like\na square) than the max \"16:9\". Ratios of portrait and landscape are considered\nequivalent.\nHowever, passing \"16:9\" would discard a banner with dimensions 1200x300 because\nits ratio is 4:1 which is way more distorted (very thin rectangle) than 16:9.\nIt would also reject a banner with dimensions 300x1200 because it is 1:4,\nequivalent to 4:1.\n\nA photo is rarely square but is almost never thin like 4:1, except panoramas, so\nconfigure this option if you intend to download panoramas for example.\nThe default value is `--max-aspect-ratio=4:1`.\n\n    --debug\n\nDebug log.\n\n## Limits\n\nimg-lurker will not interpret javascript, though it has specific hints to detect\nlazy-loaded images, so it might not work on sites like instagram.\nimg-lurker will not open iframes, so it will fail to download a few images from\nreddit.\nimg-lurker does not crawl a site and does not support nested galleries, it only\ntakes one gallery and expects it to contain the images desired.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://gitlab.com/hydrargyrum/img-lurker", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "Hg", "maintainer_email": "dev@indigo.re", "name": "img-lurker", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/img-lurker/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/img-lurker/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://gitlab.com/hydrargyrum/img-lurker"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/img-lurker/1.0.1/", "requires_dist": ["Pillow", "weboob"], "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "Web gallery downloader", "version": "1.0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>img-lurker</h1>\n<p>img-lurker is a gallery downloader.</p>\n<p>img-lurker takes a URL of a (HTML) web page and downloads linked images on it.\nIf the page contains only thumbnails, linking to a the full size version of\nthe image, img-lurker will rather take the bigger one.\nIf there are links to other HTML pages (themselves containing a the full size\nimage), img-lurker will follow those links to find the bigger size.</p>\n<p>img-lurker has a \"minimum image size\" for considering an image is worthy of being downloaded and\nisn't UI stuff like buttons/separators. img-lurker will not follow links if the link tag doesn't\ncontain an image tag (assumed to be the thumbnail).</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p>Consider a site with following HTML:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"fullimage1.jpg\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"thumbnail1.jpg\" /&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"fullimage2.jpg\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"thumbnail2.jpg\" /&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>img-lurker would download \"fullimage1.jpg\" and \"fullimage2.jpg\".\nIf instead the links point to other HTML pages containing the full size version\nof the images (for example \"fullimage1.html\" containing \"fullimage1.jpg\"),\nimg-lurker would still find fullimage1.jpg by following the page links.</p>\n<h2>Options</h2>\n<pre><code>--cookie KEY=VALUE\n</code></pre>\n<p>Inject a specific cookie, which might be required to visit some restricted\naccess pages.

To install pp in Python 3, [download the zip file with the Python 3 port of Parallel Python](https://www.parallelpython.com/content/view/18/32), extract its contents, go to the contained directory and open a command prompt there, then run `python setup.py install`.\n\nparsac uses [SALib](https://github.com/SALib/SALib) for sensitivity analysis. Typically, this can be installed with `pip install SALib --user`. If you are using [the Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com), you can instead do `conda install SALib` (you may need to add `-c conda-forge`).\n\n## Known issues\n\n* On Windows, parallel runs may finish with several \"ERROR: The process \"xxx\" not found.\" messages. These are harmless and can be ignored - the analysis has completed successfully and all results have been correctly processed.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/BoldingBruggeman/parsac", "keywords": "", "license": "GPL", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "parsac", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/parsac/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/parsac/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/BoldingBruggeman/parsac"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/parsac/0.5.5/", "requires_dist": ["netCDF4"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "AutoCalibration tool written in Python", "version": "0.5.5", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p># parsac</p>\n<p>parsac (formerly acpy) is a Python-based tool for sensitvity analysis and auto-calibration in parallel.\nIt is designed for analysis of models that take significant time to run.\nFor that reason, it focuses on storing and exploiting every single model result,\nand performing model runs in parallel on either a single machine or\non computer clusters.

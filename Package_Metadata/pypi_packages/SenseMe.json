I would expect it will probably also work with their lights.\n\nIt might also be useful for controlling DIY projects as the protocol is very simple and would be easy to clone. And, if you were to use their API the Android and iOS apps may work to control DIY devices. A suggested idea would be to add an Arduino or Raspberry Pi and a relay or two to your own fan and use this or the Haiku Home app to control them. I've read that doing this sort of thing [with a resistor is a dangerous idea, so don't do that.](https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?t=1263401)\n\nSniffing the packets and documenting the protocol were the work of [Bruce](http://bruce.pennypacker.org/tag/senseme-plugin/). Much of the code was based on his work on making [an Indigo plugin](https://github.com/bpennypacker/SenseME-Indigo-Plugin)\n\nSee [Issues](issues) for known issues or if you want to contribute but don't know where to start. Some easy fixes are labeled.\n\nI am not affiliated with Haiku Home or Big Ass Fans. Their support rep said this project seemed cool in it's infancy, and they even answered a technical question regarding the protocol for me, so hopefully they still approve.\n\n# Future\nSome ideas for future related projects and features:\n\n 1. Plex plugin (dim the fans when the movie starts and light up when it is paused or ends? Yes, please!)\n\n 2. Alexa / Google Home plugins (see REST API below)\n\n 3. Store information in a database (sqlite, or even json, would be fine) rather than discovering each time.\n\n 4. Track usage and temperatures\n\n 5. Other automation system plugins\n\n 6. REST API backend with a CLI client (a basic direct to fan command line client was added in 0.1.3)\n\n 7. React or other web based client for the above API\n\n 8. Docker image for the above\n\n 9.

Basically\na way to make a web server, quickly and simply to serve dynamic stuff\nback to the server.\n\nWhat does it do?\n----------------\n\nServes compiled page templates back to the user. That's all really,\nbasically it takes the file on the file system and serves it back. If\nthat file happens to be a page template it compiles it with simpletal\nand then spits it back to the user.\n\nIt's not a CGI server (it doesn't serve Python scripts back).\n\nIt's not Zope, it doesn't do any of that stuff Zope does. It's simple.\n\nIt does GET and HEAD, that's it.\n\nIt does not make good cups of tea.\n\nUsing\n-----\n\nSee ``example.py``\n\nMake a directory and put a start.py, that reads::\n\n  from spats import SimplePageTemplateServer\n  SimplePageTemplateServer.start()\n\nThis won't do much however, you need to tell it where to read HTML\nfrom. So you can pass a config dictionary variable through of all the\npossible values.\n\nSo make a directory called say ``html`` or ``pt``. Stick a PageTemplate,\ncalled say ``index.pt`` in there. Now pass that directory through and\nyou are on your way::\n\n  from spats import SimplePageTemplateServer\n  config = {\"html_dir\":\"html\"}\n  SimplePageTemplateServer.start(config)\n\nSee ``SimplePageTemplateServer.py`` for a commented list of variables.\n\nScripts\n+++++++\n\nPass through a ``scripts_dir`` value in the config, and everything in\nthat dir that: ends in .py and contains a ``__main__`` method will be\ncompiled into the scripts context.\n\nSo you can then access in TAL ``scripts/foo`` where foo is your\nscript. This will call the ``__call__`` function.\n\nNote: in a script the context will be assigned to the script, this is\nthe context variable in TAL so you can access all TAL variables in the\nscript. See some examples in the reports site.\n\nYou do not serve scripts directly, you serve PageTemplates that call\nscripts.\n\nSimpleTal\n+++++++++\n\nThis is rather quirky if you are used to Zope TAL, but you should get\nthere quickly. Main quirks:\n\n- elements have to be closed ``<p tal:content=\"foo\" />`` must be ``<p\n  tal:content=\"foo\"></p>``\n\n- the context is different because we build that ourselves and it can\n  be tricky\n\n- attributes errors fail silently which is kinda nice but confusing\n\nBut it doesn't do...?\n---------------------\n\nSo add it dude, its only a 200 line module. But keep it simple please,\nor goal is to be able to throw together things simply and quickly not\nrebuild Zope.\n\nChange history\n**************\n\n0.1 (2008-12-10)\n================\n\n - Initial release as a Python egg [sidnei].\n\nContributors\n************\n\n- Andy McKay\n\n- Mark Hammond\n\n- Neil Kandalgoankar    \n\nDownload\n********", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://enfoldsystems.com/", "keywords": "server template tal", "license": "LGPL", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "spats", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/spats/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/spats/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://enfoldsystems.com/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/spats/0.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Spats or Simple PAge Template Server is an attempt to make a simple little Page Template Server that can be used by everyone", "version": "0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"quick-overview\">\n<h2>Quick Overview</h2>\n<p>Spats or Simple PAge Template Server is an attempt to make a\nsimple little Page Template Server that can be used by\neveryone.

The integrity and authenticity of the stored documents is\r\nensured by means of digital signatures which are enforced by redsmaster for \r\nevery head commit. Because of this, it is also possible to trace every change that \r\nwas made back to it's author with non-repudiation of origin.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is also a built-in SSH server with user management and access control.\r\nSo you can share the documents with those you want to by giving them the address \r\nof the server running redsmaster.\r\n\r\nThey can just use a standard mercurial client to connect to the server at the \r\nspecified port (standard: 2222). For example:\r\n    \r\n\thg clone ssh://averagejoe@yourserver:2222/your-repo\r\n    \r\nRedsmaster also supports public key login with SSH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#################################################\r\n# Requirements \r\n#################################################\r\n\r\nTo run redsmaster you need to have installed:\r\n\r\n- s3ql\r\n- python 2.7\r\n- python-pip\r\n- python-dev\r\n\r\nThen simply install redsmaster using pip:\r\n        \r\n    pip install redsmaster\r\n\r\nOr if you can't install it throug the Package Index, \r\ndownload the packed file and install it with:\r\n\r\n\tpip install path/to/redsmaster-x.y.z.zip\r\n     \r\nThis packed file is available on the downloads page as well as the \r\nGnuPG signature file for it (redsmaster-x.y.z.zip.asc).\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to use a virtualenv for this. \r\n\r\nThe user running redsmaster must be in the fuse group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#################################################\r\n# Usage\r\n#################################################\r\n\r\nHere is a short usage example for Amazon S3.\r\n\r\nSetup the filesystem in an existing S3 bucket:\r\n    \r\n    redsmaster setup s3://your-bucket/\r\n    \r\nThis will require your login information for S3. \r\nAfter this is finished you can start redsmaster by typing:\r\n\r\n    redsmaster start s3://your-bucket/\r\n    \r\nNow you can access the repositories just like you would with a normal \r\nmercurial server. Note, that right now there are 2 standard users: \r\nguest and admin. They have no password so make sure to set them by typing:\r\n    \r\n    redsmaster adduser admin --password\r\n    \r\nThis will prompt for the new password for admin.\r\n\r\nNow, you can start playing with redsmaster and when you're finished just type:\r\n    \r\n    redsmaster stop\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n#################################################\r\n# Changelog\r\n#################################################\r\nVersion 1.0.4:\r\n\t- Fixed incompatibilities with Cement 2.4\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0.3:\r\n\t- Only a few small changes to prepare the next update\r\n\t\r\nVersion 1.0.2:\r\n\t- Initial release", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://bitbucket.org/tpoeppke/reds", "keywords": null, "license": "Apache", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "redsmaster", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/redsmaster/", "platform": "POSIX,UNIX,Linux", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/redsmaster/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://bitbucket.org/tpoeppke/reds"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/redsmaster/1.0.4/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Revision controlled and encrypted document storage for cloud services.", "version": "1.0.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>\ufeff#################################################\n# Introduction\n#################################################</p>\n<p>ReDS stands for Revision controlled document storage.\nWith reds you can store your documents encrypted in the cloud\nand still have full control over them,\nbecause the encryption key is not stored at the cloud service provider.\nTherefore even the cloud service provider can\u2019t access your data.\nThe encryption key is not stored anywhere else, so be careful not to lose it.</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not all.

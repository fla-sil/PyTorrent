This module is intended to be the most minimal\n  of all three and provide an efficient, stream-based API. It doesn't\n  support automatic redirects or chunked transfer encoding.\n* ``urequests`` implements a subset of API of the popular 3rd-party package\n  ``requests``. ``requests`` brags itself as \"HTTP for Humans\", which\n  means that its API is not ideal, and implementation is inefficient.\n  ``urequests`` implements only a subset of it, and tries to mend some\n  poor defaults of the prototype module. Still, it's less efficient\n  than ``urllib.urequest``. Redirects are handled, but not chunked\n  transfer encoding.\n* ``uurequests`` is capture of the version 0.8 of ``urequests``, before\n  opening the door for adding more features to the latter. It's provided\n  for very small systems which still would like requests-like API.\n* ``uaiohttpclient`` is an HTTP client for ``uasyncio`` module. It's\n  the only of all 3 which supports chunked transfer encoding.\n\nThus, the selection guide:\n\n* Whenever possible, use ``urllib.urequest``.\n* If you write a once-off, throw-away app where you don't care about\n  efficiency, you can use ``urequests``.\n* If you wrote that for very small system and above didn't work, can\n  give ``uurequests`` a try.\n* If you devel an async app, use ``uaiohttpclient``.\n* If you need support for more HTTP protocol features, use\n  ``uaiohttpclient`` and write an async app.\n\nFuture of the modules:\n\n* ``urllib.urequest`` is intended to stay minimal and unlikely will get more\n  features (it's suitable for ~80% of possible usage scenarios).\n* ``urequests`` has bloat in its DNA, so likely will slowly grow more features\n  to match the upstream module, which will make it even less suitable for\n  low-memory targets.\n* ``uurequests`` was snapshotted to address concern of such low-memory systems\n  support. It's static, and only critical bugfixes are intended to be applied.\n* ``uaiohttpclient`` may get updated as needed.\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy-lib", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "pycopy-urequests", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pycopy-urequests/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pycopy-urequests/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy-lib"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pycopy-urequests/0.9.4/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "urequests module for Pycopy", "version": "0.9.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>pycopy-lib currently offers 4 HTTP client modules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><tt>urllib.urequest</tt></li>\n<li><tt>urequests</tt></li>\n<li><tt>uurequests</tt></li>\n<li><tt>uaiohttpclient</tt></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This README is intended to describe differences among them and help\nto choose the right module for a particular use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><tt>urllib.urequest</tt> implements a subset of API CPython standard library\nmodule urllib.request.

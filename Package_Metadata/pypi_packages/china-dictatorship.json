This was the original goal.\n* serve as a censorship bomb to block GitHub in China: <<keyword-attack>> to destroy the <<gfw>> and <<dictator-needs-gfw,therefore the CCP>>. Or more realistically get added to the <<github-gov-takedowns>> hall of fame.\n* be a fun and sometimes silly source of Chinese mostly anti-CCP culture like a better https://en.uncyclopedia.co/wiki/China[Unencyclopedia] / http://web.archive.org/web/20191209021646/http://encyclopediadramatica.rs/China[Encyclopedia Dramatica] without the stupid stereotype jokes. Just quickly browse the pictures with Ctrl + F \"Figure\" and have fun.\n* serve as a place where people can post interesting related stuff in the issues: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues see also: <<shitpost>>\n* highlight positive about China's culture outside of its shitty government, such as <<the-best-chinese-supermarket-food-products,food>> and <<music>>. This has two goals:\n** teach foreigners (maybe even Chinese people on certain points) about amazing Chinese things that they can consume\n** show wumaos that <<ciro-santilli>> is not as clueless about China as they think\n\n[[faq]]\n== FAQ \u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u7b54\u96c6\n\n[[why-keyword-attack]]\n=== Why attack websites with censored keywords?\n\n<<keyword-attack, The attack>>.\n\nTo <<effective,destroy the firewall>>.\n\nThis would then end <<censorship>>.\n\nAnd then <<dictator-needs-gfw,I believe>> that this would also <<why-end-dictatorship,end the dictatorship>>.\n\nThe keyword attacks increase the cost of censorship.\n\nIf commies censor things, they will get worse IT technology, and thus become less <<richer,less rich>> and militarily powerful.\n\nSince all they care about, like any other politicians, is power, the only way to make them stop censorship is to make the cost of censorship higher than not censoring.\n\nWithout the threat that China will be less technologically, and therefore militarily advanced, there is no incentive for the CCP to destroy the firewall.\n\nThe goal is to put them in a position where they have to choose between either:\n\n* having military power\n* remaining a <<dictatorship,dictatorship>>\n\nbut not both, since having both means that they will <<war,start WW3 and destroy humanity>>.\n\nRelated attack: <<photobombing-like-attacks>>.\n\n[[harm-programmers]]\n==== Does Ciro Santilli want to harm the Chinese programmers?\n\nNo.\n\nThis is not a revenge of any kind.\n\nHe knows he is harming you on the short term, and he doesn't like that.\n\nBut he believes that this harm is a necessary means to reach his real goal, which is to destroy the firewall, and the dictatorship.\n\nDon't you think it is worth a try? Destroying the firewall, would <<why-end-dictatorship,enormously benefit>> not only Chinese programmers, but every single other Chinese person too.\n\nOnce the firewall is destroyed, which <<dictator-needs-gfw,may destroy the dictatorship>>, he want China to develop the best science and technology in the world, and <<would-you-like-to-live-in-china>>.\n\nAnd by the way, with his https://github.com/cirosantilli[extensive contributions to open source software], Ciro is already helping China, and all underdeveloped countries, become stronger.\n\nSee also: <<disturbs>>.\n\n[[meant-to-be-used]]\n=== Politics should not be posted in technical websites such as <<github>> or <<stack-overflow>>.\n\nIs the Chinese government using the Internet the way it was meant to be used, by investing billions in <<censorship>>?\n\nWhat about <<nine-nine-six-icu>>? Did you also complain about it, or did you just star it like 250k of your fellow programmers?\n\nAny act of protest will use things in ways that it was not meant to be used.\n\nFor example, the street is not meant to showcase protest banners, it is meant to be a passageway for cars.\n\nAs engineers, we have a moral responsibility towards society. We should not blindly follow orders of those in power if it violates our principles, e.g. build weapons or censorship mechanisms. And we should freely express our principles and violation concerns.\n\nMaking a statement where no one will ever see it, like a personal website, is <<effective,sure to have no effect>>.\n\nMuch of the best art and technology is about using something in a way that it wasn't meant to be used.\n\nFinally, the political powers of each website decide what is allowed or not on their website, and what is not allowed gets blocked. So far, Stack Overflow and GitHub's Terms of Service have said go ahead:\n\n* <<stack-overflow>>\n* <<github>>\n\nInfinite duplicate pool:\n\n* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/labels/meant-to-be-used\n* https://github.com/caffeine-overload/bandinchina/issues/89\n\n==== Is Ciro Santilli making programming contributions with the main intent of promoting your political agenda?\n\nNo, that is just a side effect.\n\nIf that were the case, I would definitely target more widely technologies, in particular Web and JavaScript, instead of obscure things like C and assembly in which I have spent tons of my time.\n\nAlso, as I've said elsewhere, my actions are very unlikely to have any actions. Much more likely to have any action, would be for me to become rich and powerful first, and the best way to do that is to invest in whatever I think is most useful.\n\nActually, it can even be argued that I'm somewhat irrational, since I would much more likely become rich and powerful by bowing down to the CCP and trying to get their money instead.\n\nOn the other hand, becoming rich and powerful is also highly unlikely, so maybe I'm just taking a low risk low reward path?\n\nI have very little free time, and will never do something for political reasons, only things that interest me technically.\n\nFinally, do you really think I'd be able to make such awesome projects if I had primarily political considerations in mind? XD\n\n===== Is Ciro Santilli making trivial edits on questions just to spam your name further?\n\nNo.\n\nI just think that website is great, and want to push it to perfection, in particular with better Google keyword hits, and uniform gramatically correct titles.\n\nIf you think that any of my edits were harmful, please ping me and open a meta thread to discuss specific edits, and I will comply with consensus.\n\n\n[[why-end-dictatorship]]\n=== Why would China be better without its Dictatorship?\n\nBecause it would make China, and the world:\n\n* <<richer,richer>>\n* less likely to get into <<war,WW3>>\n* <<intolerance,safer for its own citizens>>\n\n[[richer]]\n==== Why would democracy and freedom of speech make China richer? \u8a00\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u8ba9\u4e2d\u56fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u5bcc\u6709\n\nThere is infinite debate about this out there, some examples:\n\n* http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2011/05/can-poor-countries-afford-democracy-becker.html (https://web.archive.org/web/20180923192824/https://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2011/05/can-poor-countries-afford-democracy-becker.html[archive])\n* https://www.quora.com/Is-democracy-or-authoritarianism-better-for-developing-countries\n\nFor:\n\n* dictatorships are more likely to start <<war>> or other <<policies,crazy policies>> like the <<great-leap-forward,Great Leap Forward>>, which completely destroy the economy in one go\n* society becomes richer when people know that they can do their startups, get rich, and stay in the country without fear of being persecuted unfairly and losing everything instead of migrating to Canada.\n+\nAny criticism of the government, even if constructive, is taken as menace to power, and more likely to be shut down, which makes the government and just becomes less efficient since there is less feedback.\n* governments are monopolies, and the more powerful they are, the worst it is for competition an efficiency in general. E.g.: the startup with better government ties wins, instead of the most efficient one.\n\nAgainst:\n\n* presidents only care about the 4-8 year horizon, while dictators can make longer term decisions to maintain power forever, their power being limited only by \"the people are happy enough to not start a revolution\"\n* dictatorships can make changes faster without the same amount of discussion that happens in democracies, where power is more spread out.\n+\nKilling a million people will make us richer? No problem, let's do it.\n+\nThat is great when they make good decisions, but it sucks when they make <<war,bad ones>> more likely.\n\nI really like https://web.archive.org/web/20180923192824/https://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2011/05/can-poor-countries-afford-democracy-becker.html[Posner's] way of putting it:\n\n____\nWhile average rate of growth do not appear to differ much between democracies and authoritarian regimes, the variability in performance does differ more among authoritarian governments. China has had remarkable growth since the 1980s, but the prolonged devastation and hardship produced by China's \"<<great-leap-forward>>\" (when millions of farmers starved to death) and its Cultural Revolution would unlikely have occurred in a democratic country like say India. Nor is it likely that say Cuba and many African nations would have suffered so long with such terrible economic policies if they had reasonably democratic institutions.\n____\n\nMaybe China was poor because of Mao's crazy communist regime. Similar regimes also made <<russia>> poor. And yes, before that exploitation by the West may have been a factor.\n\nDefinitely, the current regime is better than Mao's, but just imagine how rich China could be if it had more freedom and justice.\n\nImperial China lost the race for the Industrial Revolution. Will another dictatorship be able to stay on top of the next technological revolution?\n\n==== Censorship makes countries poorer\n\n<<dictatorship,Dictatorships>> need <<censorship>> to survive, and they must control all information to make themselves always look good: <<dictator-needs-gfw>>.\n\nAs a result, knowledge of problems flows more slowly, and therefore they also take longer to solve.\n\nMaybe this hurts the argument, but Hillary agrees: :-)\n\n____\nBut countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century\n____\n\n.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccGzOJHE1rw&t=2110 \"Secretary Clinton Speaks on Internet Freedom\", U.S. Department of State, 2010-01-22\nvideo::ccGzOJHE1rw[youtube,height=400,width=600,start=2110]\n\nAlso mentioned at: link:https://youtube.com/watch?v=d3dE_LDz_9E?t=1681[Google versus China - VPRO documentary - 2011]\n\nThis is also the basis of a <<keyword-attack>>.\n\nThis is also well illustrated in the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries)[HBO 2019 miniseries \"Chernobyl\"], which suggests that part of the reason why Chernobyl happened is because of the Soviet Union's obsession to save face.\n\n.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6kYod3_gwk Chernobyl supercut scene where the reactor explodes, and a chief engineer \"Comrade Dyatlov\" accepts the 3.6 Roentgen measurement as \"Not great, not terrible\" and forwards it to his superiors who take actions based on that, even though the radiation measurement apparatus only goes up to 3.6 Roentgen. Needless to say, the actual radiation was much, much higher: when a proper measurement is made, the value is 15000 Roentgen! The URSS only admitted Chernobyl three days after when Swedish nuclear plant radiation detector alarms started going off. Notably, in order to keep it secret, they for example did not cancel the https://time.com/4313139/post-chernobyl-parade/[International Workers' Day parade in Kharkov, Ukraine which happened five days after the disaster].\nvideo::M6kYod3_gwk[youtube,height=400,width=600]\n\n.Photo of a CDV-717 radioactivity meter that maxes out at 3.6 Roentgen like the one that would have been used in Chernobyl. https://www.reddit.com/r/ChernobylTV/comments/bnio6n/36_roentgen_on_a_cdv717/[Source].\nimage::https://web.archive.org/web/20191102143219if_/https://i.redd.it/f806kp316ox21.jpg[height=400]\n\nThis suggestion is even more explicit in the fictional https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Z[World War Z] 2006 novel by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Brooks[Max Brooks] about a <<corona,virus>> outbreak in China.

That is why famine does not occur in democratic countries. Unfortunately, there are a great many countries in the world which do not yet have democratic systems.\n____\n\nalthough like any other political argument, https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/01/arts/does-democracy-avert-famine.html[some disagree].\n\nVirus outbreaks and other natural disasters also illustrate this well: <<corona>>.\n\n[[corona]]\n===== Censorship of the 2019 Corona Virus 2019\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u8ff9\u8c61\u5ba1\u67e5\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019 | https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75c5\n\nThe Chinese Government censored the initial outbreak in January and did not inform Wuhan on January 8, which likely made the situation much worse than what it could have been.\n\nGood timelines so without a fucking paywall:\n\n* https://www.axios.com/timeline-the-early-days-of-chinas-coronavirus-outbreak-and-cover-up-ee65211a-afb6-4641-97b8-353718a5faab.html \"Timeline: The early days of China's coronavirus outbreak and cover-up\"\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2019\u201320_coronavirus_pandemic_in_November_2019_\u2013_January_2020\n\nTimeline:\n\n* 2019-12-27 several genomics companies had sequenced the coronavirus and noticed the similarity to Sars.

And use that as an excuse to get rid of rivals while at it.\n\nHowever, there is one much better solution to that: democracy and freedom of speech.\n\nThe reason is obvious: with censorship, corrupt politicians can <<internal-censorship,internal censorship>> anything bad that they did, and so it becomes much harder to destroy corruption.\n\nIn George Bernard Shaw's \"Maxims for Revolutionists\" words:\n\n____\nDemocracy substitutes election <<uneducated-masses,by the incompetent many>> for corruption,appointment by the corrupt few.\n____\n\n[[effective]]\n=== Will the keyword attacks really help to destroy the firewall?\n\n==== Embargoes make the dictatorship stronger\n\nThe <<keyword-attack,keyword attack>> is basically an embargo.\n\nThere is already a lot of literature about this, specially in the cases of Cuba and North Korea. It is basically a libertarian vs conservative / Cato vs Heritage thing in the US:\n\n* https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/no-embargo-harms-cubans-gives-castro-excuse-policy-failures-regime\n* https://www.heritage.org/trade/report/why-the-cuban-trade-embargo-should-be-maintained\n* http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_big_idea/2006/08/thanks_for_the_sanctions.html\n\nThe key dilemma is is:\n\n* if we keep contact with the Dictatorship, maybe its people will see that democracy is better and start a liberating revolution\n* if we keep giving technology to the Dictatorship and it does not become a democracy, we are making a Dictatorship more technologically advanced, and therefore <<war,dangerous>>\n\nSome interesting aspects of the keyword attack embargo:\n\n* it is immediately self enforcing: we don't need politicians to decide and enforce the complex \"if you do this, we punish you like that\" question.\n+\nBy political and technological information is together, and this immediately puts the dictatorship in a bad spot, without us having to decide anything.\n* by affecting programmers in particular through Stack Overflow and GitHub, we make them more likely to develop better <<censorship-circumvention,Firewall climbing>> tools themselves\n\nOne point in favor of the embargo is that China has opened up since the 80's 90's, but did freedom improve at all? Under <<xi-jinping>>, it may be argued that it did not, and maybe that we should just stop feeding them technology and accept that they won't become free.\n\nTrump's link:https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/trump-banning-huawei-beginning-of-biggest-trade-war-ever-united-states[2019 China trade war], and in particular the Huawei ban, is an event that have brought this question to the spotlight once again.\n\n===== Keyword attacks could be used by certain CCP political groups to justify blocking off the entire external Internet, and make the dictatorship even more pervasive\n\nIt is a risk, but it would make China drastically <<richer,less powerful>>, so at least they wouldn't be able to start or sustain <<war,WW3>>. So I don't think it will go that way.\n\n[[effect]]\n==== Keyword attacks on programming websites will never have any effect\n\nThat is true with high probability, just like any other individual which tries to influence 1B people.\n\nEvery action is statistical: I just push the balance a little bit towards freedom.\n\nThis FAQ and any talk is useless. You and I are wasting our times here.\n\nThe possibility of blocking Stack Overflow and GitHub is 1000x more useful than any talk, but it is still useless.\n\nHowever, potentially blocking those websites takes <<better-to-do,0 of my time>>, I just leave the content there, so it is worth my time.\n\nTo have an idea, in 2015 there are about:\n\n* 20M developers in the world\n* 2M in China : https://www.quora.com/Approximately-how-many-programmers-are-there-in-the-world http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/european-technology/there-are-185-million-software-developers-in-the-world-but-which-country-has-the-most/\n* 5M Stack Overflow users http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/227868/select-count-from-users\n* TODO I wonder what percentage of GDP those programmers control. I'll bet any programmer on Stack Overflow is at least 5x more powerful than the average Chinese.\n\nAnd if we never start somewhere, nothing will ever happen.\n\n[[so-block-cost]]\n==== Stack Overflow and GitHub could be blocked at no cost by the Chinese government\n\nHitting the block button has of course no cost.\n\nThe cost of blocking Stack Overflow lies of course in the loss of information, and slower technological development, see also: <<why-keyword-attack>>\n\nRemember that it is not possible for the Chinese government to block only certain pages of HTTPS websites due to encryption: either the entire IP / domain name is blocked, or nothing.\n\nThe 2019 <<nine-nine-six-icu>> event however brought to my attention that Chinese (usually WebKit-based) browsers are already censoring HTTPS websites selectively of course, see e.g.: https://github.com/996browser/996.BROWSER/tree/77f28a36a862e3cc4d238dc47c19872156096bc4\n\nBut I doubt developers use those browsers right? The only way would be for China to forbid foreign browsers entirely.\n\n=== This is your personal problem, we have nothing to do with it, stop punishing us for it\n\nWe have to fight for justice for our fellows, or else when injustice happens to us, no one will fight for use either.\n\nEvery form of protest incurs some damage. E.g., if we manifest on the street, it generates a traffic jam.\n\nI don't like it, but I think it is worth it.\n\nIf you just work to make money and have a good life, without any plans to improve the government, you are just making the economy of the dictatorship stronger, then when they start a <<war,war>> or kill yet another minority, blood will also be on your hands. See also: <<what-should-western-countries-do-about-china>>.\n\n[[intolerance]]\n==== Most Chinese people don't care about the minorities\n\nHow can you be that certain that your children won't have dissident ideas and be punished unfairly for them?\n\nIntolerance is a risky way to live. Everyone is part of one minority in one way. If all minorities were oppressed, everyone would be oppressed.\n\nDictatorships crush minorities much more than democracies.\n\nDo think the majority of the Chinese people would vote to put 50 year old <<falun-gong>> meditating aunties in jail, if the CCP hadn't made a huge propaganda campaign and used an iron fist?\n\nAre the Chinese really that selfish to vote for this oppression, even as the <<censorship,free media>> would show videos of meditating old ladies in jail on national television? I don't believe this.\n\nMinorities are put in jail because the CCP fears them. Dictatorships can only survive if there is zero difference in opinion in the population.\n\nSee also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerance_(film)[Intolerance (1916) film]\n\n[[stability]]\n=== If anyone disagrees with the government they must be punished to keep the stability of the country\n\nDestroying diversity is the best way to reach a point where everyone can agree to start <<war,a new big war and destroy everything>>.\n\nThe CCP thrives on the excessive <<fear-of-west,fear it instigate into its own people>>.\n\nHow can society improve, if we are never allowed to try new things out?\n\nChange in democracies does not require <<violence,violence>>. Violence happens because the government punishes any dissidence, even if pacific, to retain its own power.\n\nIn democracies, radical policy changes happen without dropping a single drop of blood.

How fucked does your political system have to be for the answer to be a \"yes\"?\nimage::{cirosantilli-media-base}/Ciro_Santilli_with_his_mother_in_law_during_his_wedding_in_2017.jpg[height=600]\n\n====== Jail post en\n\nMy girlfriend's mother, a 63 year old lady, was kept 15 days inside a Chinese \"correctional facility\" because she does Falun Gong.\n\nShe had to stay all the time in a small room with a bed and a toilet, under video surveillance, being fed three meager meals a day.\n\nI see Falun Gong http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong as just another <<flg-religion,moderate religion>> which causes no harm to its believers. The only reason that it is unofficially outlawed in China is because the communists fear it as a political competitor.\n\nThere was no trial and no explanation. She was going to take a train to visit her sister. But she didn't know that there was an important political event happening in the capital: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_National_People's_Congress So the police at the station, who already knew she did Falun Gong, took her away.\n\nWhen she came back home, the house had been searched and was all messed up. Her religious books and computer were missing.\n\nI'm glad she was not physically harmed. I find it fascinating how even well educated Chinese support a government which simply does not represent some of its people. How will you feel <<intolerance,when something like that happens to your own family, and there is nothing you can do about it>>?\n\n====== Jail post zh\n\nTranslation by <<why-does-ciro-santilli-love-china-so-much,my wife>>:\n\n\u6211\u5973\u670b\u53cb\u7684\u6bcd\u4eb2\uff0c\u4e00\u4f4d63\u5c81\u7684\u5973\u58eb\u88ab\u76d1\u7981\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\"\u52b3\u6559\u6240\"\uff0c\u53ea\u56e0\u4e3a\u5979\u70bc\u6cd5\u8f6e\u529f\u3002\n\n\u5979\u88ab\u8feb\u5f85\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u5c4b\u5b50\u91cc\u9762\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u5f20\u5e8a\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6392\u6cc4\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u5904\u5728\u76d1\u89c6\u5668\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bcf\u5929\u4e24\u4e2a\u7a9d\u5934\u4e00\u7897\u53ea\u6709\u51e0\u4e2a\u767d\u83dc\u53f6\u7684\u6c64\u3002\n\n\u6211\u770b\u8fc7\u6cd5\u8f6e\u529fhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong \u53ea\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u548c\u5e73\u7684\u4fe1\u4ef0\uff0c\u5bf9\u76f8\u4fe1\u5b83\u7684\u4eba\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u574f\u5904\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u88ab\u975e\u5b98\u65b9\u7684\u5b9a\u4e3a\u8fdd\u6cd5\uff08\u5176\u5b9e\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u9879\u660e\u786e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7981\u6b62\uff09\uff0c\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u5c31\u662f\u5de5\u4ea7\u515a\u5bb3\u6015\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u653f\u6cbb\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u3002\n\n\u6ca1\u6709\u5ba1\u8baf\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u5979\u6b63\u51c6\u5907\u5750\u706b\u8f66\u53bb\u770b\u5979\u7684\u59d0\u59d0\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5979\u5e76\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u90a3\u4e2a\u65f6\u5019\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u4f1a\u8bae\u6b63\u5728\u9996\u90fd\u8fdb\u884c\uff1ahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_National_People's_Congress\n\u6240\u4ee5\u90a3\u4e9b\u77e5\u9053\u5979\u70bc\u6cd5\u8f6e\u529f\u7684\u94c1\u8def\u8b66\u5bdf\u628a\u5979\u5e26\u8d70\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u5f53\u5979\u56de\u5230\u5bb6\u4e2d\u65f6\uff0c\u623f\u5b50\u88ab\u641c\u67e5\u8fc7\u4e86\uff0c\u56db\u5904\u4e00\u5207\u6df7\u4e71\u3002\u5979\u7684\u4fe1\u4ef0\u4e66\u7c4d\u548c\u7535\u8111\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u6211\u5f88\u5e86\u5e78\u7684\u662f\u5979\u8eab\u4f53\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u53d7\u5230\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u5f88\u610f\u601d\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u4e9b\u53d7\u8fc7\u826f\u597d\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u600e\u4e48\u80fd\u591f\u8feb\u5bb3\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u5b83\u7684\u4eba\u6c11\u7684\u653f\u5e9c\u5462\uff1f\u5982\u679c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\uff0c\u800c\u4f60\u4ec0\u4e48\u90fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u505a\uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u600e\u4e48\u60f3\uff1f\n\n====== Jail post pt\n\nTranslation by myself:\n\nA m\u00e3e da minha namorada ficou 15 dias num \"centro de corre\u00e7\u00e3o\" chines porque ela faz Falun Gong.\n\nEla ficou o tempo todo num quarto pequeno com uma cama e banheiro, sobe videovigil\u00e2ncia, recebendo 3 refei\u00e7\u00f5es pequenas por dia.\n\nPara mim, o Falun Gong http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong \u00e9 apenas mais uma religi\u00e3o moderada que n\u00e3o causa nenhum problema para seus crentes.

She was there. They asked if she still did Falun Gong. She said yes. They took photos of her Falun Gong books / posters. They were polite.\n\nOctober 2017: 7 - 8 cops came to her house _at 11PM_. They knocked the door strongly and made noise, and questioned neighbours of her whereabouts. Luckily she was not there.\n\n=== China is fine as it is, stop making it worse\n\nWelcome to the wonderful world of democracy, a world where people can have different political opinions than you :-)\n\nIf you are so fine, why are you reading this at all?

Only then we feel calm and secure.\n\nNo need to prove your point of view in defending the fate of the home land.\n\nNo responsibility.\n\nJust raise your hand in the honor of him, who will take care of everything for you,\n\nJust shout out \"Hail Hitler!\" and everything will become understandable.\n\nNo more worries.\n____\n\n.https://youtube.com/watch?v=YsXhgzX56cA&t=2086 Seventeen Moments of Spring (1973), Episode 7, general confession scene.\nvideo::YsXhgzX56cA[youtube,height=400,width=600,start=2086]\n\nIt is amusing that there is a <<russia,Soviet>> movie criticizes dictatorships.\n\nWhen the dictatorship turns again you our your family, will you fight, or will you just let them do whatever they want because they can never be wrong?

This way, the majority can always discuss and vote to change what can be censored or not.\n\nIn China, trying to discuss of changes laws puts you in jail, so bad laws cannot be changed.\n\nSee also: <<richer>>.\n\n[[snowden]]\n===== Snowden \u65af\u8bfa\u767b\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden | https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u7231\u5fb7\u534e\u00b7\u65af\u8bfa\u767b\n\nThe level of unknown surveillance that Snowden uncovered is a bad thing about the US.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that the level of surveillance in any dictatorship will be infinitely higher, since the Government has much more power.\n\nSnowden's prosecution was inevitable. Countries need secret services. Secret services need laws that prevent leaking classified information that was produced by government officials.\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> has never and will never criticize China or any other country for spying or prosecuting spies.\n\nThe problem with dictatorships, is that they make _every_ information that makes them look bad a \"state secret\". Including any information that hundreds of thousands of people have witnessed, or economic performance metrics! See also: <<internal-censorship>>.\n\nIf Snowden were Chinese, the Chinese government would ban talking about him or anything he uncovered. A <<keyword-attack,keyword attack>> with \"Snowden\" in the West has no effect.\n\nOn the West however, the debate Snowden sparked cannot be censored, and has helped to control excessive and secret state power.\n\nUltimately, Ciro thinks camera surveillance is somewhat inevitable, because people will always want to fight crime and terrorism and surveillance technology keeps getting cheaper and cheaper.\n\nHe is however strictly against the ban of cryptography.\n\nHe also believes that a good solution to balance out government power is the second amendment. It is better to have more school shootings and less full blown dictatorship led genocides / mass human rights violations.\n\nIn 2019 China amusingly censored passages Snowden's \"Permanent Record\" autobiography book, which Snowden then published on Twitter:\n\n* https://twitter.com/snowden/status/1194092273170038784 (https://web.archive.org/web/20191112083232/https://twitter.com/snowden/status/1194092273170038784[archive])\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/dv5q8o/china_censors_edward_snowdens_new_book_he/ (https://web.archive.org/web/20191112083147/https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/dv5q8o/china_censors_edward_snowdens_new_book_he/[archive]).\n\nAs a https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/dv5q8o/china_censors_edward_snowdens_new_book_he/f7axckl/[Redditor put it]:\n\n____\nI don\u2019t think they understand that what Snowden stands for is completely the opposite of what the Chinese gov is lol\n____\n\nSnowden then later released the entire Chinese version of the book for free online with the censored parts underlined: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/10/snowden_china_censorship (https://web.archive.org/web/20200213001653/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/10/snowden_china_censorship[archive]), link to the book: link:++https://a.temporaryrecord.com/Permanent_Record_-_CN_edition_with_underlined_redactions.pdf++[] (https://web.archive.org/web/20200212144108/https://a.temporaryrecord.com/Permanent_Record_-_CN_edition_with_underlined_redactions.pdf[archive]). One wonders why he didn't just do that in the first place for all versions, maybe he needed to pay the writer that helped him?\n\n.Snowden highlighted defects on abuses of power in a Western democracy, and the discussion he sparked helped to control such abuses. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Edward_Snowden-2.jpg[Source].\nimage::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Edward_Snowden-2.jpg[height=400]\n\n===== Fake news\n\nWhen a government controls all information to make it look good, and no one can challenge it, you cannot trust _any_ of the news produced by that country, as anything could be fake.\n\nIt is much better to have some fake news, but also few sources which are likely telling the truth.\n\n===== Bad things have been done in the name of freedom\n\nE.g.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks[September 11th].\n\nBad things have been done in the name of anything.\n\nIt's just that <<war,much>>, <<xinjiang,worse>> <<tiananmen,things>> are done without freedom than with it.\n\nDemocracies cannot necessarily protect weak countries from powerful ones either. No political system can do that, because humans are trash essentially.\n\nWhat democracy do is to protect its own people against its own government. Because when the government turns against part of the population in a dictatorship, that part of the population gets crushed entirely, without any chance to fight, because they don't have an army or ally countries like other countries do.\n\nHere are some images that <<wumao>>'s like to post:\n\n* Left Right Slaughterhouse comic: http://9gag.com/gag/ayn7KmW?ref=fbp\n\n[[russia]]\n==== Russia \u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\n\nRussia is clearly the number 2 <<dictatorship>> in the world by population / GDP and the link:https://www.ploughshares.org/world-nuclear-stockpile-report[#1 nuclear arsenal], so here we go.\n\nI've always been curious to how Russia can be both oppressive and a democracy, unlike China which doesn't even try to pretend. This is what I gather:\n\n* the government controls all major media. If any media says bad things against them, the government finds pretexts to create lawsuits or increase taxes against such companies. Therefore all people end up thinking that the government is good.\n* just like China, they emphasise the threat of the foreign countries, especially the US, as a justification for having an oppressive power.\n* the government puts pressure on any significant opposition candidate. One technique is to find some reason to put them in jail for 2 months, which by Russian law forbids them from participating in further elections.

This could either be a genius plot to waste the money of enemies of the state, or due to a crappy divided IT system between the border control and the VISA people.\n\nFinally, even after the border, there is still the possibility that Ciro could be stopped in the country half-way through the visit and sent back, or be interrogated for a few days, or less likely murdered with poison.\n\nTherefore, if you think that living in China is fundamental to understand it, please just explain what you think one can learn from the experience instead. Do you really need to live there to see its censorship machine working?

This would likely equate A2 / B1 in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages[European system].\n\nPhonetics wise, Ciro can't distinguish or produce a few sounds, notably `-ing` vs `-in` and my off-tone rate is high, but it tends to not matter at all compared to the lack of vocabulary.\n\nCiro reads with link:http://www.perapera.org/[Perapera], write with a mixture of link:https://www.pleco.com/[Pleco], Google translate and Googling to see if Chinese actually say the sentences that way.\n\nHe <<characters,hasn't tried to learn characters>> because <<chinese-characters-are-insane,too much effort>>, but he did learn the most common ones without trying.\n\nCiro really wishes he could learn more, but he has other more important endeavours at the moment :-(\n\nHe initially learnt from book that come with audio recordings in the first 6-months to 1 year in 2010, but that got impossibly boring afterwards, so he later moved to just basically talking as much as possible non-important things to <<why-does-ciro-santilli-love-china-so-much,his wife in Chinese>>, and whenever he reaches one that I don't know that seems useful, he Plecos it up or just \u600e\u4e48\u8bf4 and then Pleco.\n\nSpoken Chinese is in Ciro's opinion a relatively easy language to learn from scratch, because word formation is so often logical:, e.g.:\n\n* volcano = fire + mountain: \u706b\u5c71(huo shan)\n* train = fire + car: \u706b\u8f66 (huo che), a reference to old https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_locomotive[steam locomotives]\n\nand there is no useless crap like verb conjugation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender[Grammatical gender], plural variants, capitalization, etc.\n\nCiro loves this language.\n\nPlease just get rid of the Chinese characters and move to pinyin like the Korean and Vietnamese did, this will make your culture much easier to export.\n\nYes Chinese characters are beautiful, yes, https://chinese.stackexchange.com/questions/2003/can-chinese-readers-scan-large-amounts-of-text-faster-more-accurately-than-their[maybe you can read faster], and yes, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_and_vertical_writing_in_East_Asian_scripts[vertical text (\u7eb5\u6392)] is awesome (but is it more efficient? https://www.zhihu.com/question/22104723[Zhihu], https://www.quora.com/Can-literate-Chinese-people-easily-read-vertical-writing[Quora]).\n\nBut they just take too much time for any sane adult to learn, it's harder than C++!\n\n===== Chinese characters are insane\n\nMaybe the commies for once <<richer,did something good>> by introducing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters[simplified Chinese characters (\u7b80\u5316\u5b57)]?\n\nThey should have gone further and reduced it to pinyin like the Viets did though.\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> smirked when he came across \"\u8484\" in Pleco, and the translation was: \"meaning unknown (herb mentioned in old books)\".

If your <<ciro-santilli-mother-in-law-jail,mother in law were put into jail unfairly for 15 days>>, for following the same religion that <<flg-bias,your wife follows>>, and if you had a social media presence, wouldn't you be tempted to do the same?\n\nWhat about you, are you funded by the CCP?\n\nSee also: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/48a95bf57a16b85619a6ae68702d18c9a5078797/FAQ.md#flg-has-been-funded-by-the-us-government-at-least-once-therefore-it-is-evil\n\n==== Would Ciro Santilli be doing his China freedom campaign if he was in China?\n\nNot with his real name attached to it\uff0c see also:\n\n* <<what-should-pro-democracy-chinese-living-in-china-do-about-the-dictatorship>>\n* <<not-chinese>>\n\n===== Does your employer support this?\n\nMy employer has nothing to do with this.\n\nHe doesn't approve or disapprove of the Chinese government or of my private actions.\n\nThe only thing that my employer _does_ believe in is that employees can have their own political opinions, and that this should not affect hiring decisions.\n\nObviously, this action limits my ability to lead high profile deals with China.\n\nAlso I'm quite curious if this would limit my ability to go to China for business, but I haven't applied for a visa since I've started this. It likely wouldn't be a good idea for me to go to China :-)\n\nBut my employer believes that inclusion and non-discrimination is more valuable.\n\nI will always do my best to not let my personal opinions affect my professional decisions, as that would be unfair to my employer.\n\n[[better-to-do]]\n==== Doesn't Ciro Santilli have anything better to do than pissing off China?\n\nIn 1989, besides <<tiananmen>> and <<ciro-santilli>>'s birth, a beautiful thing called the World Wide Web was invented!\n\nThe Internet gives everyone the magic power of writing something, and having million people read it for free!\n\nThis is how much time Ciro spends on this project to give you an idea:\n\n* every week or two, someone sends me a message, he reply with \"read the FAQ\", and usually update\n* Ciro https://www.reddit.com/r/China amongst many other programming subs, and all major bad news show up there. See also: <<anti-commie-info>>\n* when something bad enough comes up, Ciro go to https://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/sensitive-words-series/ and update <<keyword-attack,his keyword attack>>. He's only been updating it on Stack Overflow and GitHub these days.\n\nThen Ciro just contributes to programming websites exactly as he would if he weren't making this campaign, and voila.\n\nEdit: to be fair, the end of 2019 and start of 2020 was such as hot year with <<2019-hong-kong-anti-extradition-bill-protests>> and <<corona>> that Ciro might have spent a tiny little bit more.\n\nBut Ciro did it only when his brain was too tired of technical stuff and unable to do more, or as a brain warm up routine in the morning.\n\nTelling the CCP to fuck off is surprisingly relaxing, you should try it some time too. It uses a different part of your brain other than the programming one.

This does have the downsides that:\n\n* it would be harder to monitor what crazy shit the commies are doing\n* those censorship mechanisms could be reused to block good websites by Western governments that are becoming Evil\n\nBut anything that pisses off the CCP is worth it, like there's much we can learn from their bullshit.

China has been trading cheap resources for technology, and we must stop that now.\n\nUnfair Chinese commercial practices must be reciprocated. Chinese companies should be forced to open joint ventures to operate outside of China, which is a trick China uses to control profits and more easily steal IP from Western companies:\n\n* https://www.msn.com/zh-hk/news/other/us-entrepreneurs-make-a-choice-rewards-of-doing-business-in-china-often-outweigh-risks-of-losing-trade-secrets/ar-BBSPC69 (http://web.archive.org/web/20190905071456/https://www.msn.com/zh-hk/news/other/us-entrepreneurs-make-a-choice-rewards-of-doing-business-in-china-often-outweigh-risks-of-losing-trade-secrets/ar-BBSPC69:[archive])\n* https://www.chinalawblog.com/2019/02/china-joint-ventures-the-long-version.html (http://web.archive.org/web/20190905071738/https://www.chinalawblog.com/2019/02/china-joint-ventures-the-long-version.html:[archive])\n\nDo not underestimate the CCP and its control over every Chinese companies and people.

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_at_War[World at war, 1973], ep. 16:\n\n____\nA dictatorship is like a snake. If you put your foot on its tail as you do it, it will just bite you and no body will be helped. You have to strike the head.\n____\n\nOnce that is taken care of, a few good options are:\n\n* if you are a psychopath, while hiding your thoughts, manipulate your enemies, infiltrate the corporate, political and military power circles, and go up the ladder\n* if you are an technological innovator, leave China and come work for the West. Don't strengthen commie power.\n\nIf you don't manage to leave China, don't do any technological work. Go work on the fields or washing dishes. Working well for Chinese companies makes the Chinese DIctatorship stronger and <<war,more deadly>>. See also: <<embargoes-make-the-dictatorship-stronger>>.\n\nAnd regardless: remember your kids that the commies are bastards every day.\n\n[[reply-policy]]\n=== Ciro Santilli's reply policy \u4e09\u897f\u7334\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u653f\u7b56\n\nPeople get kind of passionate sometimes about politics. And some of them might also be just malicious <<wumao,wumaos>>, although it is generally not possible to distinguish between them.\n\nIf you are not a wumao, consider this:\n\n* Ciro Santilli is one, and antagonists are millions. It is therefore not possible to reply to all antagonists.\n* Ciro has in the past tried to be nice to stupid people, and they gave nasty replies\n* all discussion is useless, <<effect,only the keyword attack has any chance of having any effect, and even that is slim>>\n\nIn order to not waste too much time on those, Ciro Santilli use the following strategy.\n\nIf the original thread post is not very interesting, try to parse it quickly and reply once, always <<better-to-do,linking to the FAQ>>, and then unfollow the thread. This shows that you're still alive, and takes little effort.\n\nThen do your best to never read the inevitable reply again. An interesting reply never follows from a non-interesting original post.

The Chinese commies are not big fans of transparency it seems.\n\nAs of 2020-03, besides the Zhao takedown, all other takedowns happened in 2019, and most seem to be <<falun-gong,Falun Gong>>/<<falun-gong-media,Epoch Times>> sponsored ways to <<censorship-circumvention,climb the wall>>.\n\nThe message GitHub shows on the blocked countries is:\n\n____\nRepository unavailable in your location\n\nThis repository is currently disabled in your location.

But that content made by other users was still removed. Therefore, this is not just a simple user ban, but active censorship.\n\nCiro's blocked account:\n\n* before deletion: http://web.archive.org/web/20190821075907/https://www.zhihu.com/people/cirosantilli/activities\n* after deletion (redirects to login page): http://web.archive.org/web/20191103071033/https://www.zhihu.com/signin?next=http://www.zhihu.com/people/cirosantilli/activities\n\nRandom unblocked control account: https://www.zhihu.com/people/lu-zhen-yu-96-65/activities (http://web.archive.org/web/20191103070652/https://www.zhihu.com/people/lu-zhen-yu-96-65/activities[archive]).\n\nFurthermore, all questions related to Ciro, including the posts criticizing him such as https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25600138[] (http://archive.is/DkooN[archive]), were taken down. This made Ciro laugh: in China, you can't even criticize that which is censored, or your post also gets taken down.\n\nCiro then created an anonymous Zhihu account after this event.\n\n====== Ciro Santilli's Zhihu ban 2018-06-25\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> was banned from Zhihu on 2018-06-25 for \"politically sensitive\" content.\n\nAs a result, since that time I will be answering Zhihu questions as issues in this repo with the https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/labels/zhihu[label `zhihu`].\n\nI have however never posted anything politically sensitive on Zhihu, unless my name and profile picture have reached that distinction, and therefore the ban is clearly an unfair per-person ban.\n\nBut of course, all is fair in love and war, and politics.\n\nPosting any sensitive content on Chinese websites is a waste of time, since it only means that they will be removed and you will waste time creating a new account, I will never do that.\n\nThe only significant content I ever posted on Zhihu is the answer to: https://www.zhihu.com/question/46957710/answer/122827944 which is purely technical, and trivial replies on threads that other people have started about me. Have those people been blocked like me?\n\nMy posts are still up and it does not appear to be possible for people to see that I have been banned, but whenever I try to take any action on the website a popup appears saying:\n\n____\n\u7531\u4e8e\u4e25\u91cd\u8fdd\u53cd \u77e5\u4e4e\u793e\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u89c4\u5b9a \uff0c\u8be5\u5e10\u53f7\u5df2\u88ab\u6c38\u4e45\u7981\u8a00\n____\n\nThis includes liking, commenting, answering, asking or trying to update my profile to say that I have been blocked.\n\nThis message also shows on my public page for everyone to see: https://www.zhihu.com/people/cirosantilli/activities but they use some JavaScript scheme complicated enough that archive.is cannot capture it.\n\nI still get notifications however, but I am unable to reply to them, specially given that all Chinese accounts, unlike mine, have no personal identifiable information due to the understandable fear Chinese citizens have of their own government, even though such accounts might be illegal in theory: <<anonymous-accounts-ban>>.\n\nThe only action that I can take now is to report abusive comments people make to me.\n\nObviously, the only effect of such ban is that I will create an anonymous account under Tor with a second cell phone if I wish to contribute in the future, and China will have less information about my political interests than before.\n\nThe private messages the website sends while banning you are:\n\n____\n\u77e5\u4e4e\u7ba1\u7406\u5458 \uff1a\u60a8\u597d\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u4e3e\u62a5\uff0c\u60a8\u7684\u5e10\u53f7\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u300c\u653f\u6cbb\u654f\u611f\u300d\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e10\u53f7\u5df2\u6839\u636e\u77e5\u4e4e\u793e\u533a\u89c4\u8303\u88ab\u6c38\u4e45\u7981\u8a00\u3002\u5904\u7406\u8be6\u60c5\u53ef\u67e5\u770b\u793e\u533a\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u89c4\u8303\u8bf7\u67e5\u770b\u77e5\u4e4e\u793e\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u89c4\u5b9a\u3002 6\u670825\u65e5 16:37 \u56de\u590d | \u5220\u9664\n\n\u77e5\u4e4e\u7ba1\u7406\u5458 \uff1a\u60a8\u597d\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u4e3e\u62a5\uff0c\u60a8\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u77e5\u4e4e\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u606f\u7ba1\u7406\u89c4\u8303\u5df2\u88ab\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002\u7528\u6237\u540d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8bbe\u7f6e\u9875\u9762\u4e2d\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u4f1a\u81ea\u52a8\u8fdb\u5165\u5ba1\u6838\u7b49\u5f85\u901a\u8fc7\uff1b\u5176\u4ed6\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e3b\u9875\u4e2d\u7f16\u8f91\u3002\u611f\u8c22\u60a8\u5bf9\u77e5\u4e4e\u793e\u533a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u652f\u6301\u3002 6\u670825\u65e5 16:37 \u56de\u590d | \u5220\u9664\n____\n\nThose messages contain links to: https://www.zhihu.com/terms2 | http://archive.is/wdXSz and https://www.zhihu.com/question/19551824 | http://archive.is/BrgV2\n\nThe ban came soon after I posted a link to my GitHub repo as a comment at: https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/ice-employee-list-github-linkedin/ maybe they are related.\n\n====== Who reported Ciro Santilli on Zhihu\n\nAt the same time the ban happened I received a public comment from user \"Eureka\" https://www.zhihu.com/people/crb912/activities | http://archive.is/1F3t6 on this thread: https://www.zhihu.com/question/46957710 | http://archive.is/PVOLd saying:\n\n____\n\u4f60\u6ee5\u7528\u4e86github\uff0c \u4e5f\u6ee5\u7528\u4e86Stackover\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eaf\u7cb9\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u3001\u7f16\u7a0b\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5206\u4eab\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u8bf7\u4e0d\u8981\u5e26\u5165\u653f\u6cbb\u6027\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u3002\u8bf7\u4e0d\u8981\u8fd9\u4e48\u505a\uff0c \u7ef4\u62a4\u793e\u533a\u7684\u975e\u653f\u6cbb\u6027\u3001\u4e2d\u7acb\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6027\u7eaf\u7cb9\uff0c\u662f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70ed\u7231cs\u7684\u4eba\u5e94\u5c3d\u7684\u4e49\u52a1\u3002\n____\n\nI am unable to get an URL that shows the comment on archive.is, so I have no proof of this claim.

Justification: non-English.\n* 2017 created one in English: Cook <<tiananmen,Tiananmen Square>> Noodle Shop.\n+\nAdded my Noodle shop to maps: https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Tiananmen+Square+Noodle+Shop/@60.6132538,15.6687509,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x94603408e3c63fb3!8m2!3d60.6132538!4d15.6687509\n+\nLeach websites that picked it up: http://kvalster.se/Falu/Uthyres/Lagenheter/Gammelvagen_49_1417351\n\nQuora is also shitty because wumaos can downvote your answer privately regardless of reputation and make it become collapsed as \"Answer may need improvement\", which means it goes to the bottom and readers have to click an \"expand collapsed answers\" button to see it, so that very few people will ever see it. Then have to appeal and wait for moderators to evaluate it. This happened for example at: https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-I-walked-around-Beijing-with-a-t-shirt-that-said-freedom-of-speech-is-pretty-great/answer/Ciro-Santilli (see also <<t-shirt>>). Ciro appealed in 2020-03-10 and the answer was reinstated on day later, but by then the question was already not being suggested as much to readers, and the other wumao answers (which criticize the USA rather than answering the question about China).\n\nOther shitty aspects of Quora include:\n\n* automatically add random topics that you don't care about to your suggestions, with no easy way to prevent that.\n* questions cannot have more than one sentence. There used to be a question body, but it was replaced with a \"link for context\". Ridiculous.\n\nAs a result, on the few occasions that Ciro posts on Quora, all content will also be mirrored here.

Tip to next <<li-hongzhi,prophet>>: make something that appeals to aspiring military officers.\n\nAnd of course: <<flg-bias>>\n\nLet's try to gather some well sourced footage showing huge numbers of believers on the streets:\n\n* http://www.aparchive.com/search?query=falun%20gong&from=1&orderBy=OldestFirst#7e34a6 AP Archive: could not find a good one there\n\n.Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners in Guangzhou, China, 1998. https://www.theepochtimes.com/finding-the-balance-between-ancient-and-modern_2248694.html[Source].\nimage::https://web.archive.org/web/20200315112422if_/https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2017/05/10/GuangzhouPractice_big-700x420.jpg[height=600]\n\n.Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners in Liaoning Industrial Exhibition, China, likely 1998. https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2016/5/21/157091.html[Source].\nimage::http://web.archive.org/web/20191108081906im_/http://falunau.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1a1744bca5595d8dc0c0aa3ca1280f04.jpg[height=600]\n\n.Hundreds of Falun Gong believers in Chengdu, China, 1998. https://faluninfo.net/falun-gong-the-practice/[Source].\nimage::https://web.archive.org/web/20200315112422if_/https://faluninfo.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/chengdu.jpg[height=500]\n\n==== Does Ciro Santilli believe in or practice Falun Gong?\n\nNo, Ciro is agnostic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism | https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u8bba and therefore believes that all the metaphysics that <<li-hongzhi>> says is not true.\n\nHere are some things that I don't like about Falun Gong for example: <<things-i-personally-dislike-about-flg>>.\n\nI think that FLG exercises and meditation are good for you, just like many other meditative practices such as Yoga, Buddhist meditation, Tai chi, deep Catholic prayer, etc.\n\nHowever I find the metaphysics and obligations boring like for any other prophetic <<flg-religion,religion>>.\n\nThe absolute truth is already known by the xref:li-hongzhi[prophet], although he does not want to give clear evidence for reasons.\n\nOr a Jesus put it in https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+4&version=NIV[Luke 4]:\n\n____\nThen the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.\n\n\"If you are the Son of God,\" he said, \"throw yourself down. For it is written:\n\n\u201c'He will command his angels concerning you,\n\nand they will lift you up in their hands,\n\nso that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'\"\n\nJesus answered him, \"It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'\"\n____\n\nAh good old prophets, their tricks haven't changed a bit in 2 thousand years! This is why <<ciro-santilli>> follows instead the religion of <<democracy-is-a-religion,science and freedom of speech>>: those religions instead say: test your God. Test your God a billion times. And if your God proves wrong once, disblieve it.\n\nAnd you just repeat these truth over and over and over:\n\n* FLG is good\n* FLG is good\n* FLG is good\n* xref:flg-religion[Aliens]\n* FLG is good\n* xref:flg-organized[You can support FLG by doing X and Y, why wouldn't you since you are saving other people?]\n* FLG is good\n* FLG is good\n* xref:flg-religion[Alternate dimensions]\n* FLG is good\n* xref:flg-medication[Maybe FLG will make you healthier, but no promises, but it will make you a better person, and that's why you should do it, but if you really really believe, you get healthier]\n* FLG is good\n* FLG is good\n* Non-followers are like this, FLG people are like that. Although non-followers who do good things are actually doing FLG without knowing it. Note: FLG even has a specific terminology for non-believers, which is translated in English as https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_new_4.html[\"ordinary-people\"]. Like other aspects of FLG however, this appears in other religions, e.g. my mother mentioned the funny term used by her Protestant's group term but Ciro forgot it, and you can see it in Harry Potter as well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle[The Muggles].\n* FLG is good\n* FLG is good\n* FLG is good\n* xref:flg-religion[Final judgement]\n* FLG is good\n* <<is-chinese-politician-x-evil,the CCP is evil>>, not figuratively, but literally as in they are representatives of, or evil supernatural beings themselves. E.g. <<jiang-zemin>> is actually an evil frog in some alternate dimension, literally, not just memecally. The Chinese Government is literally responsible for creating <<corona,Covid-19>>. They give the CCP too much credit. The CCP are just a bunch of lazy and greedy people like you and me.\n\nCiro would really like to know if <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>> really believes in FLG, or is just a complete manipulating charlatan, but unfortunately we will never know that.\n\nJust imagine if before he died he published a video saying: \"it was a joke, gotcha!\". Now that would be **epic**!\n\nSince Ciro is good natured, it's hard for me to believe that he doesn't believe in anything, how can anyone be that evil? Maybe he believes in part of it, but made up some stuff to sell it better, maybe with good intentions that selling the fake part would also lead more people to see the good part?\n\nLike any other prophetic religion, FLG gives tiny evidence that you can directly feel through meditation. The energies, which Ciro believe are real feelings. And then using that entry point asks you to believe a whole lot more, that you can't feel.\n\nThis becomes especially strong when a critical mass of believers is reached, and then they start interpreting all sorts of events as miracles, and you start to believe other believers without questioning them, and a circle is formed.\n\nThis post by a former believer gives what Ciro feels is a realistic account that matches my observations: https://medium.com/@Ben_D_Hurley/-10677166298b \"Me and Li\" by Ben Hurley published on October 23, 2017.\n\nAnd yet, all those who love freedom, must oppose FLG ban, or be themselves enslaved by tyrants themselves: <<democracy-is-a-religion>>.\n\nIn any case, at least FLG got one thing right: the commies are <<is-the-chinese-government-is-evil,evil>>, and we have to get rid of them.\n\nSee also: <<flg-fake>>.\n\n===== How much does Ciro Santilli know about Falun Gong?\n\nHe hasn't read their <<flg-canon,canon>> himself, no patience, but he has had constant contact with believers and so has an idea of its content.\n\nCiro has summarized his toughts about <<falun-gong>> at: <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong>>.\n\n[[flg-canon]]\n==== What are the canonical Falun Gong texts?\n\nIt appears that Falun Gong cannon is present at: http://falundafa.org/\n\nIt contains <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>>'s approved texts / speech transcriptions, which are sacred.\n\nThe only sacred version is Chinese which is a sacred language, and of which there is only one perfect revision. Islam also appears to place great importance on the sacredness of Arabic in which Mohamed first spoke, perhaps even more: https://nationalinterest.org/feature/plight-uyghurs-why-muslims-wont-speak-their-brethren-112466 Protestants and later the Catholic church, have moved away from such really bad strategy however, the accessibility of Christianity is seen on the entrance of many many churches which have a sign \"ALL are welcome\". Well played.\n\nI think <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>> claims the specifically chose to reincarnate in China this time.\n\nThe English translation is made by followers, and gets new revisions to reduce translation imperfection.\n\nHowever, the Chinese language seems to be fundamentally sacred, and there might never be an sacred English version approved by LHZ.\n\nLHZ is of course a de-facto God with superpowers, and can of course speak all languages, but for reasons he didn't just write an English translation himself.\n\nThis is a reasonable command to download the English cannon for grepping:\n\n....\nwget -r -l inf --no-remove-listing --no-clobber --no-parent -w 2 https://en.falundafa.org/falun-dafa-books.html\n....\n\nTODO: need to find a way to wrap lines, otherwise grep might fail on sentences.\n\nNothing else is canonical. LHZ seems to have said that there are enlightened followers, but has not specified who, so we can't derive canon from anyone else.\n\nNotably, <<flg-organized,FLG media>> such as http://www.minghui.org/ is believer led and thus not canonical, even though believers have very high confidence on it, and LHZ <<flg-organized,directly supports it>>.\n\n==== Do you support FLG, or just use it because it is a censored?\n\nI don't support FLG specifically, only freedom of religion.\n\nI use it in my usernames simply because it is the most banned and censored one in China today.\n\nI believe that <<thoughtcrime,individuals should only be put in jail for what they do, not for what they believe>>.\n\nI consider FLG <<flg-religion,a religion like any other>>, and I am against its ban, as I am for all other religions.\n\nAlso I believe that freedom of speech and democracy imply that FLG and other religions will exist. If you want freedom, you have to <<intolerance,accept other people's choices>>.\n\nOtherwise, <<democracy-is-a-religion,democracy and communism can also be considered as religions>>, and banned.\n\nSee also: <<flg-verifiable>>.\n\n[[flg-daily]]\n==== How is it like to live with Falun Gong believers?\n\nThis will obviously vary from believer to believer, but here my experience.\n\nLike any other religion that is taken seriously, they spend several hours per week doing their standard religious activities: <<flg-religion>>.\n\nI have never seen them, or anyone we know from FLG say or do something that I consider morally incorrect because of FLG.\n\nThis does not prevent <<wife,my wife>> from working normally.\n\nMy mother-in-law, who is retired, dedicates all her time to Falun Gong when she is not taking care of the house.\n\nMy mother is also religious (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism[Protestant]), and I get a very similar feeling about both groups.\n\nLike other religions, Falun Gong gives them meaning in life, and I admire that they pursue their belief energetically.\n\nI much prefer that my mother-in-law does Falun Gong, which is a noble meaningful goal, rather than watch stupid crap on television.\n\nAlso, although I am <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong,agnostic>>, I also live in a similar way.\n\nMy religion is that of science and technology, and I pursue it fervently by trying to learn and teach it and spend several hours a week doing that, even when it does not give me money immediately.\n\nIf I pursue my meaning, why should I prevent anyone from pursuing theirs?\n\nPreviously, my wife and mother-in-law would sometimes try to persuade me to learn FLG, which was annoying.\n\nBut every time I told them very clearly that I know where to download the books if I want to, and that I may never want to read them, and that my wife must either accept this fact of leave me.\n\nAnd they have accepted that: they think I'm a good person, and they can accept that you can also be a good person even without doing FLG.\n\nI do feel Falun Gong makes my mother-in-law more reluctant to use or actively search for <<flg-medication,medication or treatment>>. But I think it is also linked to the fact that she didn't have a very good education or a good health system around. However, if we give her something, she will take it. My wife does not have any resistance to medication.\n\nOne thing that does worry me is that my mother in law sleeps too little every night, doing one of the Falun Gong meditations late in the evening, and then waking up very early to a long series of reading and exercise sessions.\n\nBibliography:\n\n* http://www.zhihu.com/question/27659795 (https://www.zhihu.com/question/27659795[archive])\u5bb6\u91cc\u6709\u4eba\u7ec3\u6cd5\u8f6e\u529f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u600e\u6837\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\uff1f\n\n==== In the Tweet about his mother in law, Ciro Santilli says \"correctional facility\", but reeducation through labour has been abolished\n\nHe was not very precise https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/579270450984984576[here], the precise term is \"jail\". He was _not_ talking about: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-education_through_labor Unfortunately it is not possible to edit a Tweet.\n\n[[flg-changed]]\n==== Falun Gong is completely different in the West than it was in China\n\nI believe that it has changed.\n\nBut isn't that the case of every cultural religious movement that migrates to a completely new culture?\n\nMain points which may have changed:\n\n* It has become more organized.\n+\nBut why shouldn't they organize to defend themselves now that they have the chance without being put into prison?\n+\nThe CCP is highly organized and has way more resources.\n* Less emphasis is given to the religious / mystical aspect, and more to the corporal exercises, and health aspect.\n+\nThis may be because people in the \"West\" are:\n+\n** are \"scientific-educated\" atheists who wouldn't go for a \"religion\"\n** already have other religions, which would view FLG as a taboo\n\nAlso maybe only the richest and most educated believers managed to escape China, and thus the movement carried that bias outside China.\n\nIf you know more ways in which it may have changed, let me know.\n\nBut once again, we can know nothing for sure about the past in China because of censorship.\n\nEven if you saw something yourself, how can you be sure that it is representative?\n\nAnd if it has changed, now that it has changed, maybe China should unban it?\n\n==== FLG has been funded by the US government at least once, therefore it is evil\n\n1.5M USD in 2010 for a FLG controlled internet freedom group http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8678760.stm\n\nBut well, if you are going to do something anyways, and someone offers you money, why wouldn't you take it?\n\nTaking the money does of course give a \"bad impression\" that someone is trying to buy influence, but does it in itself imply that you are doing something bad?\n\nBut do you really think that the US government paid that to buy influence in FLG? What would they force upon that FLG group that they didn't already want to do? Isn't it more likely that the US government wanted them to continue doing exactly what they were doing?\n\nEvery government funds groups it supports, it is an all out war I suppose. Compare that to the propaganda funds of the CCP.\n\nWhat about the funding of political campaigns, which vastly outnumbers 1.5M USD every year?\n\n[[follow-the-law]]\n==== FLG is illegal in China, we must follow the law\n\nThis might be a bad law that should be changed.\n\nIt was perfectly legal for <<nazi,Nazis>> to kill Jews. Does it make that right?\n\n[[flg-fake]]\n==== FLG is fake \u6cd5\u8f6e\u529f\u662f\u5047\u7684\n\nThe same can be argued about any other religion or political belief of type: it is better if we organize society in this or that way.\n\nHow can you disprove their belief, when as in any other religion, every affirmation made hinges on \"miracles only happen around when true believers are around\" or \"only true believers can perceive evidence in their hearts / minds directly\". He died of cancer? Not a true believer.\n\nConversely, do you understand the full sequence of experiments that imply quantum field theory? Have you seen videos of those experiments? Have you attended live demonstrations? Do you understand the construction of the experimentation apparatus? Yet, why do you believe it?\n\nMore importantly: what do you propose that should be done about it? Should we kill followers? Or is jail enough?\n\nAlso do let me know when you have achieved irrefutable proof that democracy/freedom of speech are the optimal ways to organize the government: <<democracy-is-a-religion>>.\n\nSee also: <<flg-religion>>\n\n[[flg-verifiable]]\n===== FLG never makes any predictions that can be reasonably verified by non-believers\n\nExactly, just like any other <<flg-religion>>, this is why I'm <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong,agnostic>>.\n\nThe closest claims to observable I've heard are:\n\n* when pictures are taken in sacred events, notably Shen Yun, sometimes you can see magic Falun energy wheels in the pictures\n* in the homes of some followers, small magic good plants-like fungi-like things have grown\n+\n.Image of the magic good small plants that grew on a believer's home. They took a photo and it published on <<falun-gong-media,Minghui>> as a 2018 Chinese New Year good wish page to <<li-hongzhi>>. If any biologist reads this, for the love of God send me a Wikipedia page with the possible species. TODO transcribe the Chinese. http://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2018/2/17/168396p.html[Source].\nimage::http://web.archive.org/web/20200312085051im_/http://en.minghui.org/u/article_images/e9c2b07e224d28984998a094deb53f85.jpg[height=400]\n* the sacred books of some believers had a closed lotus flower when they were bought, and after several years, the flower opened\n\nbut I suspect they are not even <<flg-canon,canon>>, just believer oral culture.\n\nOf course, like every other religion, reality happens to be is constructed in a way that prevents non-believers to verify anything with their eyes in a reproducible way.\n\n[[flg-cult]]\n===== FLG is a very new religion and therefore fake\n\nThe Romans called <<christianity>> the \"Cult of Jesus\".\n\nIf I tell a lie today, will it become true in a thousand years? Or a truth today become a lie?\n\nTry sending an email to <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>> asking him to <<flg-verifiable,prove his powers to you>> :-)\n\n[[against-censorship-and-flg]]\n==== Many people both are against censorship and FLG\n\nCiro know that, and that supporting FLG is \"bad\" for his public image with most Chinese, including those that are against censorship.\n\nBut <<dictator-needs-gfw,without censorship, there will be democracy>>, and with democracy FLG followers will have voting rights, and FLG will become legal.\n\nCiro thinks that the situation is very similar to <<flg-religion,Scientology>> in the USA today: most people dislike it, but believe that you can believe whatever you want.\n\nDemocracy and Communism <<democracy-is-a-religion,can also be considered as religions and persecuted>>.\n\nIsn't it convenient when a dictatorship gets rid of those weirdos for you? But not so much when suddenly you or your family is the weirdo...\n\nIf you are not ready to accept the beliefs of others, dictatorship is the only choice for you.\n\nIt is also interesting to note how Falun Gong is a good source of <<censorship-circumvention>> material.\n\nSee also: <<flg-bias>>\n\n[[democracy-is-a-religion]]\n===== Why do you say that democracy is a religion just like FLG?\n\nBecause it also specifies irrational and fundamental aspects of how one should live, notably voting and freedom of speech.\n\nLike the Cult of CCP has one fundamental belief: <<stability,the Party is always right>>.\n\nBan FLG, and you have banned democracy.\n\nAccept democracy, and you will have FLG.\n\n[[flg-stability]]\n===== Falun Gong had to be banned because it was a threat to the stability of the country\n\nThen they link to the Taping Rebellion:\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Heavenly_Kingdom\n\nOf course FLG it was a threat to the stability of the country.\n\nIt is, as <<ciro-santilli>> has said, a highly organized political power: <<flg-political>>.\n\nHowever, <<democracy-is-a-religion,democracy>> is a threat to the stability country in the exact same way:\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution\n\nAnything that goes against a dictatorship is a threat to the stability of the country.\n\nNow read: <<stability>>\n\n==== Many people say they do FLG only to get VISAs to the USA\n\nHeard this a few times, and I believe it has happened.\n\nBut I don't see how this is relevant at all to this discussion:\n\n* if they are not really FLG believers, they should be prosecuted, but this says nothing about the real FLG believers,\n* if they are, then why wouldn't they seek a VISA, since they are in constant threat of going to jail or worse in China, and the USA law gives them that right?\n\nSample news:\n\n* https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/09/28/652218318/thousands-could-be-deported-as-government-targets-asylum-mills-clients\n\n[[flg-witness]]\n==== I have personally seen people do bad things because of Falun Gong\n\nEither direct suicide or <<flg-medication,dying because of not taking medication>>.\n\nFirst, I'm not saying I don't believe you, and I'm sorry about what happened.\n\nBut your testimony is worthless unless you give the following:\n\n* clear unique personal identification\n+\nThis is because the CCP has thousands of <<wumao,wumaos>> who could make fake reports.\n+\nThere are basically two ways to do that:\n+\n. your testimony is done in video form on YouTube clearly showing your face as you make it\n. links between a notable social media presence that is hard to achieve, e.g. Twitter with many followers, Stack overflow with a lot of rep, and the account\n+\nEither of those must contain / link to information that uniquely identifies you. Generally, full name, city and date of birth is enough.\n* a precise testimony that states exactly what you saw happen with your own eyes, or heard from people that are very close to you.\n+\nThe testimony must include:\n+\n--\n** when the events happened\n** where they happened, in which city at the very least\n** the full names of who did what\n--\n+\nThis is to:\n+\n** make it easier to verify the truth of the event\n** uniquely identify the event so we don't count a single event multiple times\n\nIf you do provide all of the above, I add your report to a list of reports that I will maintain. This list does not exist yet because there were no valid reports yet.\n\nNext consider this:\n\n* are you sure that Falun Gong made the person do the bad thing, and that the person wouldn't have done it anyways?\n+\nDid someone from Falun Gong told the person to do it?\n+\nI bet that if you look into patients of psychiatrists, you will find more suicides than average. So should we ban psychiatry?\n* are you sure that the order came from <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>>, and that it was not just some disgruntled local leader using Falun Gong for his personal madness and doing things he did not approve?\n+\nBranch Davidians were inspired by <<christianity>>. So should we ban Christianity? What about the majority of Christians who have never done anything bad?\n* only statistics has any meaning, and it would require a very large number of reports to make up statistics, so you will likely be wasting your time. I will do my part and maintain a list however.\n* if ask for FLG believers to compile a list of horrors they have suffered, which they have already been doing since the start of the persecution, I bet that their list will be much longer than yours, because they are so <<flg-organized,well organized>>\n\n[[flg-persecution]]\n==== FLG does not have proof of their persecution claims\n\nHow much proof do you think they would be able to get when there is no freedom of press?\n\nDo you think that forbidding a <<falun-gong-is-not-important-to-be-worth-discussing,70 million>> person religion could have gone smoothly?\n\nDo you think the thousands of personal of accounts of human rights violations that exist are all fake, and don't indicate that many, many more have taken place but fallen under censorship?\n\nConversely, there is no reliable proof that FLG is bad as claimed by CCP that has been verified by international media.\n\n[[thoughtcrime]]\n==== Someone from movement X did something bad, therefore the movement should be banned\n\nBy this logic, everyone should go to jail. The law should only punish individuals.\n\nThe communist party, which has had continuous power since 1949, killed millions during the <<cultural-revolution>>. Surely they must be banned, no?\n\nBut the CCP has changed so much since those days, I hear you say.\n\nI agree. And <<flg-changed,so has FLG>>.\n\nSee also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtcrime[thoughtcrime] from <<nineteen-eighty-four>>.\n\nOr if you like shitty movies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)[Minority Report (2002)].\n\n===== Movement X tells people to do something bad, therefore the movement should be banned\n\nE.g. kill.\n\nYes, convincing someone to do something bad is as bad as doing it yourself of course, and must be forbidden.\n\nNow proceed to prove that FLG made and will continue making people do bad things, going through:\n\n* <<flg-witness>>\n* <<flg-changed>>\n\n[[flg-political]]\n==== People from movement X are only in it for political power\n\nFor every desire of the masses, there will be amoral representatives that will step to use that power.\n\nStill, those representatives cannot gain power if there is no backing desire from the society.\n\nThe only advantage of <<richer,democracy>>, is that those representatives have to pretend harder to do things for that group to retain their power.\n\n[[flg-trump]]\n===== FLG supports Donald Trump \u6cd5\u8f6e\u529f\u652f\u6301\u7279\u6717\u666e\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> believes he has heard praises to Trump directly in <<li-hongzhi,Li Hongzhi>>'s speeches, but could not find a source.\n\nAlso, the <<flg-organized,Epoch Times Falun Gong controlled newspaper>> has donated: $1.5 million https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-qanon-impending-judgment-day-behind-facebook-fueled-rise-epoch-n1044121\n\nBut of course, so long as those respect the laws of the country, they are free to do it and must not be interfered. As if other major American media didn't have political agendas.\n\nIt is therefore extremely likely that 99.999% of Falun Gong believers also support Trump.\n\nThis is exactly the same, in fact, as <<flg-religion,Christian groups>> which always gather behind \"the right\".\n\nIn the case of the Falun Gong however, Trump has been vocal about China's threat, and therefore is a much needed ally of the movement.\n\nTrump's immigration policies have turned Asian Americans towards the democrat opposition however as of 2019: https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/13/18308137/asian-american-voters-immigration-democrats-donald-trump\n\nOne saving point of the republicans for Asians is the opposition to university quotas instance, which many Asians feel blocks their high performing kids from top schools for less deserving Black students. This also plays into possible cross Asian-Black racism tensions.\n\n==== Western media has exaggerated reports on FLG for propaganda reasons\n\nPossibly true, but which reports are you talking about specifically?\n\nAll that I care about is:\n\n* it is censored today\n* if you do it you go to jail\n* there were tens of millions of followers at the time of the ban\n\nwhich I think are undeniable.\n\nThe only question that matters is: should it be banned or not?\n\n==== Do you believe in the allegations of human rights violations done to Falun Gong believers?\n\nLet's just focus on the evidence:\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CedVnJOgwg4 \"Undercover video reveals brutal treatment of Falun Gong prisoners inside Chinese labor camps\" by \"FOX 11 Los Angeles\" published May 21, 2019. Names mentioned: Fuquan Yin,\n\n===== Do you believe in the allegations of organ harvesting made by Falun Gong believers?\n\nIn short: I believe that it has happened to many people.\n\nLong version:\n\nIt is obviously very hard to prove and quantify it definitely, much like it was hard to prove the Holocaust: bodies were cremated, and bribes were paid.\n\nEven if we had a video showing the whole process, showing the whole money flow from donor to prison guard, it would still be hard to quantify it, so I do have some room for doubt in this opinion.\n\nBut consider the following, which is based on what I heard.\n\nEven Chinese officials have admitted that in the past, if the body of the executed person is not claimed by family, then the organs can be extracted even without the consent of the prisoner:\n\n* https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/07/china-still-using-executed-prisoners-organs-transplants-vatican\n* https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-the-face-of-criticism-china-has-been-cleaning-up-its-organ-transplant-industry/2017/09/14/d689444e-e1a2-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_story.html\n\nPerhaps now that they claim that there is a large voluntary organ donor database, then this has stopped or been reduced, but let's focus on that period when the extractions were widely done.\n\nFrom this, even though China does not publish execution statistics, we can imagine that a large part of the organs come from prisoners sentenced to death.\n\nThen, consider that a <<falun-gong-is-not-important-to-be-worth-discussing,70 million>> person religion was banned, leading to a huge influx of prisoners from that religion.\n\nFLG followers are just de-facto criminals like any other, and so extracting their organs is also de-facto legal.\n\nAlso, people from that religion don't drink alcohol, smoke or take drugs, and their organs are of good quality.\n\nFurthermore, FLG prisoners continue to not bow down to the government even in prison, e.g. by doing their <<flg-religion,Falun Gong meditation>>, which makes them clearly identifiable and dangerous to the system.\n\nFinally, add to that mix the huge level of corruption found in dictatorships.\n\nDon't you think, then, that it is extremely likely that it has happened many times that such people have been selected to be executed earlier than others on average, due to the monetary value of their organs?\n\nBibliography:\n\n* https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-019-0406-6 (https://web.archive.org/web/20191118135832/https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-019-0406-6[archive]) \"Analysis of official deceased organ donation data casts doubt on the credibility of China\u2019s organ transplant reform\" by Matthew P.

The Falun Gong organization also specifies guidelines on how to preach, although these might not be <<flg-canon,canon>>, even though if they are not, it is extremely likely that <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>> is directly involved in their specification\n\nOr a <<flg-cult,cult>>, which is nothing but a new/small religion with negative connotation, and thus meaningless.\n\nFLG is very similar to Scientology in Ciro's view: a new religion that mixes elements of both old and new. And just like any other religion, <<democracy-is-a-religion,their practice must be allowed>>.\n\nBut consider this: how to classify what a religion is?\n\nSome would answer: science is what everyone can perceive with their own senses.\n\nBut FLG followers claim to feel FLG energies when doing the exercises, and a few of them have the power of seeing the other dimensions.\n\nOn the other hand, how many of your friends have experienced the laws of quantum field theory or general relativity in a very direct way?\n\nAnd aren't pro-democracy believers also taking actions based solely on a shared belief, possibly organized by a pro-democracy leader?\n\nFrom a purely strategic point of view, the \"religion\" denomination would be:\n\n* good to FLG because the concept of freedom of religion carries considerable weight in the West\n* bad for FLG because people who already have a religion would be less likely to try it out and start believing\n\nSee also: <<flg-daily>>.\n\n[[flg-organized]]\n===== FLG downplays the fact that it is highly organized\n\nMany FLG practitioners claim that they are not at all organized, or that they have no political interest, and I truly believe that they mean it.\n\nBut it is obvious from the size of the FLG related media, namely:\n\n* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV[NDTV television network]\n* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times[Epoch Times newspaper]\n* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Yun_Performing_Arts[Shen Yun Performing Arts]\n\nthat in practice they do have are a highly organized hierarchical structure, and very likely with <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>> at the very top, e.g.:\n\n* Shen Yun's 2018 libretto says that their Artistic Director and founder is \"D.F.\" (likely an abbreviation for Da Fa, which is an abbreviation for Falun Gong Dafa, which is a full name of Falun Gong), with a picture of LHZ on top. It also amusingly says that D.F. is a \"Distinguished Professor of Music and Dance at Fei Tian College in New York\", which is likely where many of Shen Yun's dancers are trained, and therefore controlled by himself to a large extent\n* LHZ mentions NDTV, Epoch Times and Shen Yun extensively on his <<flg-canon>>. TODO link to source, this based on unintentionally overhearing to my family members reading it.\n\nFurthermore, Falun Gong practitioners directly lobby foreign governments to take action against human rights abuses in China, e.g.:\n\n* http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+MOTION+P7-RC-2013-0562+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN\n* https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-court-cisco-must-be-held-accountable-aiding-chinas-human-rights-abuses\n\nLike any other religion, they have all the right to take those actions, and it is definitely in their best interest, and perhaps in the best interest of the whole world, that they do so.\n\nThe only thing that annoys me is their lack of self perception on this matter: the large majority of Western people would definitely classify them as an organized political force after having observed their activities. When they say otherwise, they are hurting their own credibility.\n\n====== FLG media is not transparent about its affiliation\n\nAgreed, and it is a point that hurts more than helps their cause.\n\nBut the media is not legally obliged to state their affiliation.\n\nAnd if that were the case, then we should force _all_ newspapers start taking pools of how many employees follow which religion and support which political party, and then put that in their print.\n\n[[flg-intolerance]]\n===== FLG dislikes several other groups like homosexuals and some other religions\n\nLike most <<flg-religion,old religions>>.\n\nDemocracy dislikes dictators.\n\nYou and I dislike certain personality traits without any logical reason.\n\nWhat matters is that we treat everyone with respect and without bias at work, even if we don't like them.\n\nBut the law can't force you to like everyone.\n\nIf one specific FLG member breaks a law by discriminating someone, they should be punished just like anyone else.\n\nSee also:\n\n* <<intolerance>>\n* <<gay-rights>>\n\n[[flg-medication]]\n===== FLG believers are less likely to take necessary medication\n\nDue to their beliefs in the healing power of FLG, which seems to have certain level of support on <<flg-canon,canonical texts>> TODO precise quotes.\n\nThis is a point that makes me worry, and I do believe that it is true for some believers, that but consider:\n\n* what matters are statistics. Maybe FLG people live longer than non FLG in average. But we will never have statistics because of censorship: http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27529/have-many-falun-gong-practitioners-forgone-medical-treatment-and-died-of-treatab\n* maybe people should be link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_legislation[allowed to choose how they want to die], not to take medication if they don't want to\n* maybe the number of people killed during persecution vastly outnumbers those who died because they would not take medication\n* several religions, including <<christianity>> have miraculous cure claims. My impression is that claims were mostly notable in the old times apparently, likely because people noticed that Christians were still dying of all kinds of diseases like everyone else, no matter how devout!\n* maybe the main reason why communists banned FLG is the political threat it posed, but that a ban was unjustified given the situation. Christian crosses are being taken down as of 2016, have they stopped taking their medications as well?\n* maybe many of those people would also have died soon even if they had taken medication\n* maybe not all Falun Gong believers thought that it was wise to stop taking medication. But their religion was banned anyways. Who can agree and follow all the innumerable prescriptions of any religious or legal system?\n* all the following also reduce people's lifespan:\n+\n--\n** riding motorcycles vs cars / buses\n** smoking\n** moving to a poor country to do charity there\n** eating fast food\n--\n+\nForbidding them also has huge humanitarian costs (more expensive vehicles, creation of a black market, ...). So why not forbid them as well?\n\n[[li-hongzhi]]\n===== FLG is dangerous because Li Hongzhi has too much power over followers\n\nLi Hongzhi (LHZ,\u674e\u6d2a\u5fd7) is the creator of FLG: link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi[].\n\nFalun Gong people call him \"master\" (\u5e08\u5085), which is a common traditional term used to respectfully address experienced teachers in a disciple (\u5f1f\u5b50)/teacher relation, e.g. Kung Fu or other crafts.\n\nThe term \"master\" is also used for example in the fictional film The Master (2012), which is likely inspired in <<flg-religion,Scientology>>.\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> prefers to call him <<flg-religion,prophet>>, since he feels LHZ is indistinguishable from <<flg-religion,any other religion>>.\n\nI agree that there is danger in every religion, and specially new religions.\n\nHowever the same point can be made about political parties and in particular the CCP and its chairman.\n\nCouldn't a charismatic leader chairman gain more and more power (like Xi seems to be doing), and eventually start a war and kill millions? Or just kill some minority which is not happy about the situation.\n\nSimilarly, any charismatic leader of a pro democracy movement could become the leader of a terrorist organization.\n\nIf you ever want democracy, you will have to learn to accept the beliefs of others, and only punish them when they actually break a law.\n\nFinally, LHZ was born in 1951, so he will die in 20 years, unless FLG is true and a miracle happens, and then this argument will become invalid.\n\nFrom what I hear, LHZ has always maintained that he is the only source of truth on FLG, and therefore, so his death will very likely remove any danger once and for all.\n\nFurthermore, it also seems to me that FLG is clearly anti-violence and self-harm, so I wonder how many would follow a contradictory order such as killing or suicide?\n\nIt is also interesting to look into the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown case. When the suicide order came, most people wanted out! Without physically controlling the followers, I don't think you can make them do much.\n\n.Li Hongzhi is Falun Gong's prophet/cult leader/living God.

Cook the minimum possible so that it is not raw. This also means taking the jiaozi out of the hot water as soon as they are done.\n* after the dumplings rise to the surface after a few minutes, let it boil, and then put some cold water on top of the hot water. Repeat this two, three or four times until they are fully cooked. This helps the jiazi keep a strong peel.\n\nThe best way to eat them is to pour some vinegar and ready-to-eat spicy preparations like <<laoganma>> or Ciro's favorite, <<fansaoguang-wild-brake-pickles>> in the bowl, and then dip them one by one.\n\nYou can also drink the soup, or for cold days, actually eat the jiaozi with their soup. Ciro likes to add soy sauce and more of the above mentioned spices.\n\nCan also be made by hand if you have the patience.\n\n<<ciro-santilli>> could basically eat those every 3-4 days and not get tired.\n\n.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQkXA1xglU8 How to Cook Frozen Dumplings (Boil) by \"Yongle Kitchen\" shows the cool water pouring process.\nvideo::YQkXA1xglU8[youtube,height=400,width=600]\n\n[[buns]]\n=== Chinese buns \u5305\u5b50 (bao1 zi)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baozi | https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u5305\u5b50\n\nYou can buy them frozen on bags with about 4 for about 4 dollars.\n\nThe best way to heat them up by far is to steam.\n\nIf you don't have a steaming pot, you can also put them on a bowl inside a regular pot with some water at the bottom, and close the lid.\n\n[[zongzi]]\n=== Zongzi \u7cbd\u5b50 (zong4 zi)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongzi | https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u7cbd\n\nBuy frozen.

But it could be so much more awesome!\" This makes non-real restaurants twice as bad. So beware, there is no turning back.\n\nMaybe we should institute a Foodie Dictatorship (\u7f8e\u98df\u5bb6\u72ec\u88c1) that prevents such fake restaurants from hiding real Chinese food???\n\n[[resturants--rating-system]]\n==== Rating system\n\n* tier 1: amazing, worth a trip\n* tier 2: worth it, but not exciting, so not worth a trip just for it\n* tier 3: I wouldn't go there\n\n[[resturants--how-to-find-good-restaurants]]\n==== How to find good restaurants\n\n* go with Chinese food-loving friends to Chinese restaurants\n* read up Chinese restaurant recommendation websites written in Chinese by Chinese for Chinese\n* read up small shady Chinese food recommendation websites by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinophile[sinophiles like me]\n\nBig Western sites like Google Maps reviews and TripAdvisor are completely and utterly useless for this and will recommend you places in which poor non-Chinese which don't know what real Chinese food is like.\n\nIf you go out on the street by yourself, you are very unlikely to find really good Chinese food since the enormous majority of Chinese restaurants are not real Chinese food.\n\nIf there are only Chinese clients inside the restaurant, it is a good indicator that it might be good. If all clients people are Western, run away.\n\nWestern people don't know what good Chinese food is, so if you are not in a place that has a very large Chinese population, real Chinese food restaurants cannot survive, and won't exist. This usually implies being in large cities of rich countries.\n\nBeware of restaurant owner changes: if the menu looks a bit different, it has likely happened.\n\nThis is politically incorrect, but here goes: if the place looks as if it is maintained by more recent immigrants, and looks more modern, it is more likely to be good. There are however some venerable older uncles who have cooked well their entire lives and are still fine. Things tend water down across generations, and there was likely not enough real Chinese clientele for them to serve real Chinese food and survive in the past.\n\nIf a restaurant advertises itself as \"Asian\", it is less likely to be very good.\n\nConversely, restaurants that specialize in a single region of China are more likely to be good (bot not certainly good).\n\nIt is already difficult to do the cuisine for one part of China well, imagine for multiple countries.\n\nJust beware of \"Sichuan\" restaurants: their cuisine is so well known even in the West that I've seen many not so good restaurants that describe themselves like that, even if the owners are from another region. But there are many good ones which really are from there as well.\n\n[[resturants--similar-lists]]\n==== Similar lists\n\n[[resturants--how-to-order]]\n==== How to order\n\nFor all restaurants, ask the waiter for suggestions. Tell him that you:\n\n* want the most typical dishes, not what the foreign locals eat, but what the Chinese eat\n* can eat spicy food, way more than any foreign local person can.\n+\nThe spice level you generally want is is \"zhong1 la2\" (medium spicy)\n+\nIf you can't eat spicy, either learn or stop reading now and accept the fact that you will never eat good Chinese food.\n* if the restaurant is from some region, ask for dishes from the region, and which are different from other regions.\n+\nI was once <<dumplings>> (super popular dish everywhere in China which I buy frozen and eat every 3 days) in a Tibetan restaurant... Yes, I do believe Tibetans also eat jiaozi! :-)\n* Speaking a little Chinese goes a long way towards convincing the owners that you can handle the real thing.\n\nOnly order dishes with meat. Those without are not worth the money / time. Aubergine is the exception.\n\n[[restaurants--france]]\n=== France \u6cd5\u56fd\n\nTraiteurs are simpler restaurants that let you see pre-made foods in a glass showcase for you to choose how big your portions will be.\n\nThey are the best way to eat a cheap and balanced meal in Paris, but I have never found one that serves exceptional Chinese food, so beware.\n\n[[restaurants--france--paris]]\n==== Paris \u5df4\u9ece\n\nParis has one of the largest Chinese communities outside of China in the whole world centered in the 14eme arrondissement, plus a lot of Chinese students with money around.\n\nAs a result, you can find some of the best Chinese food in the world outside of China!\n\nBibilography:\n\n* http://carnetdecroute.blogspot.fr\n* http://cnkick.net/2013/09/10/les-meilleurs-restaurants-chinois-de-paris-le-guide-cn-kick/\n* https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Chinese-restaurants-in-Paris\n* http://www.newsavour.com/restaurants/ Chinese only, Paris, website subsidiary of some larger Chinese group.\n\n* Restaurant Sichuan (\u5ddd\u91cc\u5ddd\u5916)\n+\n17 Rue le Peletier, 75009 Paris\n+\nXianglaxie.\n+\nLast checked: 2017/06\n* Chez Yong (Ding Ding Xiang, \u9f0e\u9f0e\u9999)\n+\n42, rue de la Colonie, 75013 Paris\n+\n** shui zhu niu rou\n** dishes with intestines\n* La Chine sur la langue (\u820c\u5c16\u7f8e\u5473)\n+\n163 rue Saint-Denis, 75002 Paris\n+\n** Spicy soup with Chinese charcuteries.

Works, but a bit clunky.\n\nMaybe some day something will be extracted from: https://github.com/skishore/makemeahanzi which jas a huge JSON of character data.\n\nWhen you want to learn \"how to say something in Chinese\", the only valid routes are:\n\n* does it have a Wikipedia page? Go on the English one then change language\n* put an English sentence on https://translate.google.com/[Google Translate], then Google for it.\n+\nIf it is a common word, it will give useless dictionary results, so search instead with `site:bbc.com` or `site:zhihu.com`.\n+\nThen find a sentence that contains the word written by a native Chinese, and understand the full sentence to confirm that it means what you want it to mean in a similar context.\n+\nJust using the Google translate directly will lead 70% to a weird/wrong/incomprehensible translation that no Chinese person would ever say.\n\nGood Chinese content to consume to learn:\n\n* \u51e0\u5206\u949f\u770b\u5b8c: illegal 10 minute summaries of movies with clips from the movies and a narrator speaking quickly instead of movie sounds.\n+\nSome have Chinese subtitles, e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFSMvtS6SYQ and it is great content to learn from, because it is someone telling a not too boring story in a natural and clear way, with supporting images to help with context.\n\n=== Chinese character sentence component mnemonic systems\n\nAssociate one word to each character/character component.\n\nOne good way to find mnemonics is to just Google for whatever random words you want to fit into a sentence. You end up learning fun things this way, and those make the best mnemonics.\n\nThen to learn a new character, break it down into components, and create a sentence or short story that includes all the component words.\n\n* <<characters>>: our own!!!!!\n* http://rtega.be/chmn/ CC-BY-NO-SA but not clear way to contribute to it\n* Proprietary books\n** https://www.amazon.com/dp/0824833236 \"Remembering Simplified Hanzi\" by James W.

China has had remarkable growth since the 1980s, but the prolonged devastation and hardship produced by China's \"&lt;&lt;great-leap-forward&gt;&gt;\" (when millions of farmers starved to death) and its Cultural Revolution would unlikely have occurred in a democratic country like say India. Nor is it likely that say Cuba and many African nations would have suffered so long with such terrible economic policies if they had reasonably democratic institutions.<br>____<br><br>Maybe China was poor because of Mao's crazy communist regime. Similar regimes also made &lt;&lt;russia&gt;&gt; poor. And yes, before that exploitation by the West may have been a factor.<br><br>Definitely, the current regime is better than Mao's, but just imagine how rich China could be if it had more freedom and justice.<br><br>Imperial China lost the race for the Industrial Revolution.

Therefore all people end up thinking that the government is good.<br>* just like China, they emphasise the threat of the foreign countries, especially the US, as a justification for having an oppressive power.<br>* the government puts pressure on any significant opposition candidate. One technique is to find some reason to put them in jail for 2 months, which by Russian law forbids them from participating in further elections.

Then have to appeal and wait for moderators to evaluate it.

My impression is that claims were mostly notable in the old times apparently, likely because people noticed that Christians were still dying of all kinds of diseases like everyone else, no matter how devout!<br>* maybe the main reason why communists banned FLG is the political threat it posed, but that a ban was unjustified given the situation. Christian crosses are being taken down as of 2016, have they stopped taking their medications as well?<br>* maybe many of those people would also have died soon even if they had taken medication<br>* maybe not all Falun Gong believers thought that it was wise to stop taking medication.

Who can agree and follow all the innumerable prescriptions of any religious or legal system?<br>* all the following also reduce people's lifespan:<br>+<br>--<br>** riding motorcycles vs cars / buses<br>** smoking<br>** moving to a poor country to do charity there<br>** eating fast food<br>--<br>+<br>Forbidding them also has huge humanitarian costs (more expensive vehicles, creation of a black market, ...).

If all clients people are Western, run away.<br><br>Western people don't know what good Chinese food is, so if you are not in a place that has a very large Chinese population, real Chinese food restaurants cannot survive, and won't exist. This usually implies being in large cities of rich countries.<br><br>Beware of restaurant owner changes: if the menu looks a bit different, it has likely happened.<br><br>This is politically incorrect, but here goes: if the place looks as if it is maintained by more recent immigrants, and looks more modern, it is more likely to be good. There are however some venerable older uncles who have cooked well their entire lives and are still fine. Things tend water down across generations, and there was likely not enough real Chinese clientele for them to serve real Chinese food and survive in the past.<br><br>If a restaurant advertises itself as \"Asian\", it is less likely to be very good.<br><br>Conversely, restaurants that specialize in a single region of China are more likely to be good (bot not certainly good).<br><br>It is already difficult to do the cuisine for one part of China well, imagine for multiple countries.<br><br>Just beware of \"Sichuan\" restaurants: their cuisine is so well known even in the West that I've seen many not so good restaurants that describe themselves like that, even if the owners are from another region.

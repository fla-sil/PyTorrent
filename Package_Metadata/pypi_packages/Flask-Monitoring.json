This allows you to gain\n  insight over which functions in your code take the most time to execute. Since all requests for an\n  endpoint are also merged together, the Dashboard provides an overview of which functions are used in\n  which endpoint.\n\n- **Collect extra information about outliers:**\n  Outliers are requests that take much longer to process than regular requests.\n  The Dashboard automatically detects that a request is an outlier and stores extra information about it (stack trace, request values, Request headers, Request environment).\n\n- **Collect additional information about your Flask-application:**\n  Suppose you have an User-table and you want to know how many users are registered on your Flask-application.\n  Then, you can run the following query: 'SELECT Count(*) FROM USERS;'. But this is just annoying to do regularly.\n  Therefore, you can configure this in the Flask-MonitoringDashboard, which will provide you this information per day (or other time interval).\n\n\nThe dashboard is automatically added to your existing Flask application.\nYou can view the results by default using the default endpoint (this can be configured to another route):\n\n   http://localhost:5000/dashboard\n\nFor more advanced documentation, take a look at the information\non `this site`_\n\n.. _this site: _http://flask-monitoringdashboard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functionality.html\n\n\nHow to use\n============\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install from source, download the source code, then run this:\n\n    python setup.py install\n\nOr install with pip:\n\n    pip install flask_monitoringdashboard\n\nSetup\n------------\nAdding the extension to your Flask app is simple:\n\n    from flask import Flask\n    import flask_monitoringdashboard as dashboard\n\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n    dashboard.bind(app)\n\nLive Demo\n------------\nTo view a live deployment of the Flask-MonitoringDashboard, `check this site`_\n\n.. _`check this site`: https://flask-monitoringdashboard.herokuapp.com/\n\nUse the credentials u:`admin`, p:`admin` to log in.\n\nFeedback\n------------\nIn order to improve our Flask-MonitoringDashboard, we would like to hear from you!

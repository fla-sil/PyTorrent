Instead of showing the most recent media, archivalook shows\nFeatured Media on the front page.\n\nQ: How do I install it?\nA: Check out this page for instructions:\nhttp://mediagoblin.readthedocs.org/en/v0.6.1/siteadmin/plugins.html\n\nQ: I set it up but I still can't feature media, what do I do?\nA: So when you first activate this plugin, no users have the proper user\npermissions to manage featured media. Below this I'll give instructions of how\nto give those permissions to yourself and no one else:\n\n    1) If you haven't already, create a user for yourself. You can do this\n       one of two ways\n        a) you can run your website, visit it, click the link that says `Login`\n           (in the top right corner), and then click the link that says\n           `Register`. Enter your information and you now have a user account.\n        b) you can use the command line tool. in a terminal, navigate to your\n           mediagoblin directory. run the command\n               $ ./bin/gmg adduser\n           and then follow the prompts on screen.\n    2) Next, you need to use the command line tool to make yourself an admin.\n       If you haven't already, navigate to the mediagoblin directory in a\n       terminal. Once there, run the command\n               $ ./bin/gmg makeadmin <username>\n       where instead of <username> you type in your actual username :P\n    3) Now you're the admin! Next, you need to run your server. It's fine if\n       you run it locally, by just running:\n               $ ./lazyserver.sh\n       from the mediagoblin directory. Visit the website, and if you click the\n       downard facing arrow to the top left, you should see that you now have\n       access to new pages, the very useful moderation panels. Click on the one\n       labeled `User Moderation Panel`.\n    4) You should be directed to a (possibly very short) table of users, find\n       your own username, and click on it.\n    5) Now you see your own `User's Detail Page`. At the bottom you should see\n       a table of all the things your user has permission to do, including\n       being active, and being an administrator. You should see that you don't\n       have permission to feature media. Fix that by clicking the `+` button to\n       the right of 'Featurer'.\n    6) Wooo!

Remove a lot of the overhead\ninvolved in coordinating purchases with users.\n\n**User Features**\n+ **Fast and flexible group buy system:**  No more back and forth between participants and the organizer.  Want to\nchange your order?  Just log in and make the changes.  They will instantly change the order for the organizer.\n+ **Streamlined case-split system:** Splitting a case with others just got a lot easier.  Pledge how many items in the \ncase you'd like to order, and other users can make pledges as well.  Once all of the items in the case gets accounted\nfor, only then it gets locked into the order.\n+ **Multiple order views:**  Three different views of event orders are available for users.  The user overview view is \na customized list showing the cases and items you've ordered, its subtotal as well as the event total.  The event \nsummary view is a concise list for the organizer of how many cases to order.  The user breakdown view steps through one\nitem at a time, showing all of the users who bought cases of it, as well as all of the case splits for that item.\n+ **Export to PDF:** All order pages include a button to export the list as a PDF to be downloaded.\n\n**Administrative Features**\n+ **Complete control of the application:**  Expanded functionality added to edit virtually all aspects of group buys.\nChange and remove items, add item categories, remove users from an event, promote others to admin rank, and more.\n+ **Optional restriction of event information:** Prevent users from seeing the orders of others, as an optional feature.\n+ **Decide who has access to your application:**  User registration can be disabled, and any users can be removed from \nthe application with a single click of the mouse.\n\n### Using Group Buy Organizer\n\n**Initial Setup**\nAfter the application is properly installed and running, create a user account.  The first account to register will be\ngiven \"root\" access in the application, all other registrations will be \"user\" tier.  From there, all there is left to \ndo is to setup categories, and to create an event.  Click the admin button on the top right, and click \"Category \nSettings.\"  Create whatever product categories that will be used in your group buy.  From there, go to home and create\nan event.  Thats it!\n\n**General Use**\nIn order to use Group Buy Organizer you must register an account.  Once thats done, go ahead and log in.\n\nThis is the general flow of the program:  Using your price sheet/case list from the wholesaler you'll be purchasing \nfrom, if the items already haven't been added by someone else, add them to the event using the form at the top of the\npage.  Once items are added, anyone is free to interact with them, whether you want to buy cases for yourself, or split\na case with some other people.  While the event is open, any user is free to add as many items, and to buy as many cases\nor involve themselves in as many case splits as they want.\n\nAs the event comes to a close, an administrator will lock it (Event Settings).  This will lock in all transactions, and\nno user can add, remove, or change their order.  Things become finalized at this point, and you can check out the totals\nusing any of the available event total buttons on the event screen or on the home screen.\n\n### Installation:\n\nInstallation is simple.  You can either download the repository from this Github page, or via PyPI: `pip install \ngroup-buy-organizer`\n\nIn order for the PDF functionality to work, you must download a binary that the program will use to convert pages to \nPDF:\nhttps://wkhtmltopdf.org/\n\nDownload and install on your server.  Go to \"Application Settings\" in the admin menu, and follow the instructions from\nthere as to how to properly link it.  The whole process only takes a couple minutes.\n\nOnce thats done, everything is good to go.\n\nLibraries used:\n- `flask`\n- `flask-bcrypt`\n- `flask-login`\n- `flask-sqlalchemy`\n- `flask-wtf`\n- `pdfkit`\n\n### License\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 - \u00e2\u02c6\u017e Mark Michon\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

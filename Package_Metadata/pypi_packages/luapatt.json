Lua\u2019s pattern matching is simpler than regular expressions\nand lacks several features that regexes have, such as ``|`` for\nalternation, but also contains some features difficult or impossible to\nduplicate in most regex flavors, such as the ability to easily match a\nbalanced pair of parentheses (or any two other characters).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n``pip install luapatt``\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nFor documentation on how pattern matching works, please read the `Lua\nreference manual`_. This library contains the following differences from\nstock Lua:\n\n-  ``%c``, ``%g``, ``%p``, and their negated counterparts are not\n   available; attempting to use them will raise the built-in\n   ``NotImplementedError``.\n-  Other character classes that rely on the meaning of a character call\n   Python\u2019s ``str.is*`` family of methods, and so use the Unicode\n   definition of that meaning.\n-  String positions are zero-based instead of one-based, reflecting the\n   fact that Python is generally zero-based (as opposed to Lua, which\n   has one-based indexes). This affects position captures and the\n   indexes returned as the first two results from ``find()``.\n-  Function return values are combined into a tuple, as is standard with\n   Python. However, singleton tuples are not returned; the single value\n   is returned directly instead.\n-  ``gsub()`` does *not* return the number of substitutions by default,\n   instead returning only the new string. To get the count, pass the\n   named argument ``count=True`` to the call (which will result in a\n   2-tuple of the new string and the count).\n-  An extra function, ``set_escape_char()``, is provided to change the\n   escape character. It takes one argument: the new escape character,\n   which must be a ``str`` object of length 1. The escape character\n   cannot be set to any of the other special characters. While it is\n   possible to set it to a letter or number, this is not recommended as\n   it may interfere with other aspects of pattern matching, and doing so\n   may be disallowed in the future.\n\n   -  **NOTE:** Because ``set_escape_char`` modifies global state, it is\n      **not** thread-safe.\n\n-  Unlike Lua, which has no notion of a Unicode string and assumes all\n   characters are one byte in length, this library operates on full\n   Unicode strings (i.e. ``str`` objects). If you pass bytes objects to\n   this library, the behavior is undefined.\n\nLicensing\n---------\n\nAs with Lua itself, this library is released under the MIT License.\n\n.. _Lua language\u2019s: http://www.lua.org/home.html\n.. _Lua reference manual: http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6.4.1\n.. |travis-develop| image:: https://travis-ci.org/jcgoble3/luapatt.svg?branch=develop\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/jcgoble3/luapatt", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/jcgoble3/luapatt", "keywords": "Lua pattern matching regex regular expressions", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "luapatt", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/luapatt/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/luapatt/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/jcgoble3/luapatt"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/luapatt/0.9.0b5/", "requires_dist": ["pytest; extra == 'test'"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Python implementation of Lua-style pattern matching", "version": "0.9.0b5", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>A Python 3.3+ implementation of the <a href=\"http://www.lua.org/home.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lua language\u2019s</a> pattern matching\nfunctions.

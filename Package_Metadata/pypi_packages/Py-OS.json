The Base OS for that class was provided and can be found [here](https://github.com/AlanClasses/TSOS). A direct port of the Base OS in python can be found under releases as version 1.0.0\n\n## Setup\nTo run the OS it must be installed. It can be installed either from pypi or from the source code of the directory.\n\n### From PyPi\n\nSimply use pip to install the [latest release](https://pypi.org/project/PyOS/) of the PyOS. To do so run `pip install PyOS`. \n\n### From Source\n\nEither in a Python Virtual Environment or just on your machine in the root of the directory run `make install` this will install the PyOS from the source code in the repo using the setup.py file. If you would like to uninstall simply run `make uninstall`\n\n## Running\n\nTo run the OS run, `python3 -m PyOS`\n\n## Releases\n\n[1.0.0](https://github.com/dgisolfi/PyOS/tree/BaseOS) - Base OS\n\n## Developing\n\nTo develop the PyOS it would be a nuisance to install each time a change is made, to avoid this use a python virtual environment. To create a Virtual environment or venv use the following command `python3 -m venv/path/to/new/virtual/environment` The path should be pointed at this repository. To enter a venv that already exists navigate to the bin dir inside of env and run `source activate`. In the case of this repo the command would look like this, `source ./env/bin/activate`.\n\nOnce in a venv to run the PyOS without installing use the following format: `python3 PyOS /path/to/source/file` while in the root of the directory.\n\n## Testing\n\nComing Soon... \n\n## Publishing to PyPi\n\nTo publish the latest release of the build to pypi run the following recipe: `make release`. This will test, build and publish the release to pypi.", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/dgisolfi/PyOS", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "Py-OS", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Py-OS/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Py-OS/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/dgisolfi/PyOS"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Py-OS/1.0.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "An OS that runs a subset of the 6502 opcodes, implemented in python", "version": "1.0.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>PyOS <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/Py-OS\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Py-OS version\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/586ad27f73b85da66b29e771eeced1b6a9a90931/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f707970692f762f50792d4f532e737667\"></a></h1>\n<p>An OS that runs a subset of the 6502 opcodes, implemented in python.</p>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>This is a python port of a Typescript OS I created for the Fall 2018 Operating Systems class.

The actual heavy lifting of parsing and writing YAML and encrypting and decrypting it is done by the excellent libraries `PyYAML <http://pyyaml.org>`__ and `cryptography <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/>`__ respectively.\nAlso, while they support both Python 2.x and 3.x this package only targets Python >= 3.5 (because it's 2016).\n\n\nAPI Usage\n---------\n\nHere's a simple example::\n\n    >>> from cryptoyaml import generate_key, CryptoYAML\n    >>> new_key = generate_key('secret')\n    >>> config = CryptoYAML('/path/to/settings.yml.aes', keyfile=new_key)\n\nInitially you must generate a key (it uses the `Fernet symmetric encryption <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/>`_ from the `cryptography <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/>`__ library) and use it to construct an CryptoYAML instance.\n\nThat instance then provides a `data` attribute which is initally an empty dictionary that you can fill with arbitrary data, provided, the `PyYAML <http://pyyaml.org/>`__ library can encode it::\n\n    >>> config.data['foo'] = 123\n\nNote, however, that the data is only persisted on the filesystem when you explicitly commit it to disk like so::\n\n    >>> config.write()\n\nOnce written, the file can be re-read as long as the original secret is still provided::\n\n    >>> reread = CryptoYAML('/path/to/settings.yml.aes', keyfile=new_key)\n    >>> reread.data['foo']\n    >>> 123\n\n\nCommand Line Usage\n------------------\n\nHaving an encrypted settings file is neat, but sometimes you might want to take a look at it or manipulate it from the command line instead of programmatically.\n\nFor this ``cryptoyaml`` has three commands for generating a key, creating a new file, reading it and setting individual settings::\n\n    # cryptoyaml generate_key mysecret\n    Created new private key at /Users/senic/Development/senic.cryptoyaml/mysecret\n    # cryptoyaml create mysettings.yml.aes --keyfile mysecret\n    created new file at /Users/senic/Development/senic.cryptoyaml/mysettings.yml.aes\n    # cryptoyaml set mysettings.yml.aes foo bar --keyfile mysecret\n    foo -> bar\n    # cryptoyaml cat mysettings.yml.aes --keyfile mysecret\n    {'foo': 'bar'}\n\n\n\nEnvironment variables\n---------------------\n\nA common practice is to provide the secret key via an environment variable.\nSimply setting ``CRYPTOYAML_SECRET`` will allow you to omit the key for both API usage and for the command line.\n\n\nRelease Information\n===================\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nVersions follow `CalVer <http://calver.org>`_ with a strict backwards compatibility policy.\nThe third digit is only for regressions.\n\n0.2.0 (2017-02-27)\n------------------\n\n- Re-released as `cryptoyaml` (instead of `senic.cryptoyaml`) to make packing simpler and to tone down the branding.\n\n\n0.1.1 (2017-01-03)\n------------------\n\nCosmetic brown bag release...\n\n -

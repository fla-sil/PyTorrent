This tool\n    can be used for quickly changing css values that are mapped to dtml-vars within plone. This is powerful for\n    the person who doesn't know css or knows it very well and has a bunch of base_properties dtml-vars added to the base plone base_properties\n    that map a theme of colors together. \n    \n    CSSManager is a modified version of Michael Geddart's CSSManager, making it compatible with Plone 2.5 and later. \n\n\nInstallation\n\n    Installation works as usual: move CSSManager into your Products directory, restart Zope, and click site setup then \"Add/Remove Products\".\n\nUse\n    1.  You will see CSSManager listed under the heading \"Add-on Product Configuration.\" \n        Follow the CSSManager link. To change the color of a CSS property, click the \n        palette icon next to the Value field. You can then use the slider to select a new color, or enter the hex code of a color. Click OK \n        when you are finished selecting a new color for a property. To change the logo, click upload file, and choose a new logo\n\n    2.  Click \"Save CSS\" at the bottom of the main page when you are finished with your changes. \n       \n    3.  The hope is you can use dtml-vars to your hearts content and match colors together that can be changed easily and fast\n\nMultiple Property Sheets\n\n    CSSManager can support editing of multiple property sheets in addition to base_properties.\n    Add them by visiting the CSS tool in the ZMI.\n    You'll need to have a property help template with the name \"yourPropSheet_help.pt\"\n    to declare widgets and help texts.

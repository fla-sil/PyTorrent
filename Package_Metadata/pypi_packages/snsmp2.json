[1]. It is implemented as a plugin\nfor the Psi4 electronic structure method, and requires Psi4 version 1.1\nor greater.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n- First, you need to install a working copy of Psi4 1.1 or greater. Head to\n  [their website](http://www.psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_obtaining.html)\n  for installation instructions.\n- Next, install this plugin using the following commands\n```\n# Grab the path to the Python interpreter used by your copy of Psi4\n$ PSI4_PYTHON=$(head $(which psi4) -n 1 | sed -r 's/^.{2}//')\n\n# Install the SNS-MP2 package with this copy of Python.\n$ PSI4_PYTHON -m pip install .\n```\n\nRunning calculations\n--------------------\n\nHere's probably the simplest possible input file. It computes the\ninteraction energy between two helium atoms separated by two angstroms.\n\n```\nmolecule {\nHe 0 0 0\n--\nHe 2 0 0\n\n}\n\nimport snsmp2\nenergy('sns-mp2')\n```\n\n\nCopy the contents to a file called `first-cak.dat.`. To run the calculation,\nexecute\n\n```\n$ psi4 first-calc.dat\n```\n\nAfter it finishes, you can find the results in `first-calc.out`.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n[1]  R. T. McGibbon, A. G.

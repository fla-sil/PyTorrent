From the [`abalone`](https://github.com/Scriptim/Abalone-BoAI/tree/master/abalone) directory run:\n\n    $ ./run_game.py <black player> <white player>\n\nReplace `<black player>` and `<white player>` each with an artificial intelligence (or human player if you want to play yourself).\n\nFor instance, play against an AI that makes random moves:\n\n    $ ./run_game.py human_player.HumanPlayer random_player.RandomPlayer\n\nLoading your own AI works analogously with `<module>.<class>`.\n\n## Abalone Rules\n\nFrom [Wikipedia][wikipedia] ([CC BY-SA][wikipedia_license]):\n\n> Abalone is an award-winning two-player abstract strategy board game designed by Michel Lalet and Laurent L\u00e9vi in 1987. Players are represented by opposing black and white marbles on a hexagonal board with the objective of pushing six of the opponent's marbles off the edge of the board.  \n> The board consists of 61 circular spaces arranged in a hexagon, five on a side. Each player has 14 marbles that rest in the spaces and are initially arranged as shown below, on the left image. The players take turns with the black marbles moving first. For each move, a player moves a straight line of one, two or three marbles of one color one space in one of six directions. The move can be either broadside / arrow-like (parallel to the line of marbles) or in-line / in a line (serial in respect to the line of marbles), as illustrated below.\n\nInitial position | Black opens with a broadside move | White counters with an in-line move\n| --- | --- | ---\n| ![Abalone Standard][wikimedia_abalone_standard] | ![Abalone Broadside][wikimedia_abalone_broadside] | ![Abalone Inline][wikimedia_abalone_inline]\n\n> A player can push their opponent's marbles (a \"sumito\") that are in a line to their own with an in-line move only. They can only push if the pushing line has more marbles than the pushed line (three can push one or two; two can push one). Marbles must be pushed to an empty space (i.e. not blocked by a marble) or off the board. The winner is the first player to push six of the opponent's marbles off of the edge of the board.\n\n## Write Your Own Artificial Intelligence\n\nIn order to write your own AI, create a python file with a class that inherits from [`abstract_player.AbstractPlayer`](https://github.com/Scriptim/Abalone-BoAI/tree/master/abalone/abstract_player.py) and implement the `turn` method:\n\n```python\nfrom abstract_player import AbstractPlayer\n\nclass MyPlayer(AbstractPlayer):\n    def turn(self, game, moves_history):\n        pass  # TODO: implement\n```\n\nHave a look at [`random_player.py`](https://github.com/Scriptim/Abalone-BoAI/tree/master/abalone/random_player.py) for a sample implementation.\n\nRefer to the [documentation][docs_turn] for details about the parameters and the return type.\n\nA particularly useful method is [`game.generate_legal_moves()`][docs_generate_legal_moves]. It yields all legal moves that the AI can perform. The `turn` method can simply return one of the yielded values.\n\n### A \"move\"\n\nThe return value of the `turn` method is called a *move*. This is a tuple, which consists firstly of the marbles to be moved and secondly of the direction of movement.  \nThe marbles are specified by the space where they are located on the board (see the image at the beginning of this document for the notation of the spaces). All spaces are listed in the [`Space`][docs_space] enum. For an inline move only the trailing marble (\"caboose\") of the line to be moved is specified. For a broadside move only the two outermost marbles are given in a tuple.  \nThe second element of the tuple is the direction of movement. These are all listed in the [`Direction`][docs_direction] enum.\nTherefore the two example moves from the images above (see *Abalone Rules*) would look like this:\n```python\nfrom enums import Direction, Space\n\n# Black opens with a broadside move\n# (returned from the turn method of the black player)\nreturn (Space.C3, Space.C5), Direction.NORTH_WEST\n\n# White counters with an in-line move\n# (returned from the turn method of the white player)\nreturn Space.I8, Direction.SOUTH_WEST\n```\n\n## Contribute\n\nAll contributions are welcome. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/Scriptim/Abalone-BoAI/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Abalone Rulebook (PDF)][rulebook]\n\n    [shields_stars]:

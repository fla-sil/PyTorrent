While intended mainly for embedding purposes, the opposite is also possible: with some tinkering, one can make this package into a full-fledged self-contained Python environment ready to support a Python application. \n\nBasically, that is what this script is for. \n\nWhen you run WinPackIt,\n    - it will download and unpack a Python embeddable package,\n    - download and install Pip into it,\n    - download and install any needed external dependency,\n    - copy your project files,\n    - optionally compile your file to ``.pyc``,\n    - leave a friendly ``install.bat`` file for the final user to run.\n\nAt this point, you may distribute the resulting \"build\" folder to the final users; all they have to do... \n    - drop the folder anywhere on their Windows box,\n    - open it and double-clic the ``install.bat`` file;\n    - this in turn will produce Windows shortcut(s) to the entry-point(s) of your app to double-click, tailored for their machine. \n\nRequirements.\n-------------\n\nYou will need Python 3.6+ to run WinPackIt. No external dependency is required. On the target side, you can produce builds based on any Python 3.5+. You don't have to match your own Python with the target Python.\n\nLinux/Mac users.\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe WinPackIt script runs on Linux too, of course. Except, the build process needs to run the target Python a few times in order to install external packages and compile ``.pyc`` files - and *that* will be impossible on Linux. Then again, if you need no external packages nor compiling, it should work as a charm. See docs for more details. \n\nUsage.\n------\n\n- ``pip install winpackit`` in your virtual environment, or even ``pipx install winpackit`` if your really like WinPackIt and would love to have it always at hand;\n- run ``python -m winpackit my_runner.py``;\n- this will produce a ``my_runner.py`` runner file for WinPackIt: open it and customize to your liking;\n- run ``python my_runner.py``;\n- this will produce a \"build\" folder of your project, as specified in the runner file settings, ready to be distributed to the final user.\n\n**See the** `doc file`_ **for more details.**\n\n.. _embeddable package: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-embeddable-package\n.. _doc file: https://github.com/ricpol/winpackit/blob/master/docs.rst\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/x-rst", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/ricpol/winpackit", "keywords": "packaging build development", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "WinPackIt", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/WinPackIt/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/WinPackIt/", "project_urls": {"Docs": "https://github.com/ricpol/winpackit/blob/master/docs.rst", "Homepage": "https://github.com/ricpol/winpackit", "Source": "https://github.com/ricpol/winpackit"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/WinPackIt/0.7.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "The quick and dirty Python packager for Windows", "version": "0.7.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>WinPackIt is the <tt>winpackit.py</tt> module, a Python script with no external dependency required.\nIt will package your Python project into a stand-alone Windows distribution.</p>\n<div id=\"how-does-it-work\">\n<h2>How does it work.</h2>\n<p>Python 3.5 introduced the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-embeddable-package\" rel=\"nofollow\">embeddable package</a> distribution on Windows: that is, an \u201calmost complete\u201d Python zipped in a single, non-installer file.

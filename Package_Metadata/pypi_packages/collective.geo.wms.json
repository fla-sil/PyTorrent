The initial\n        add form only allows you to enter the url and type of a webservice.

When the server could be successfully added\n        you can change the title, descripton and keywords. You are not allowed to change\n        the server url or protocol. A list of layers that are available on this server will\n        be requested directly from the server. The list of layers will be cached\n        for 100 minutes so if layers are added on the server you may have to wait\n        up to 2 hours for them to refresh.\n        \n        After you added the servers you can add layers to your website. Layers\n        are displayed as a Map.\n        \n        In the add form you choose the service for your maps. You cannot change\n        the server later by editing the layer.

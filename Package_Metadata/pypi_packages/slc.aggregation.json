For example, each Collection we add, needs to be\ntranslated into about 22 languages.\n\nThis product therefore adds a new aggregation mechanism, for use in sites with\nmany language versions.\n\nHow to use:\n===========\n\nA new subtype 'Aggregator' is created in descriptors.py and it can be applied\nto all Folders in the Site.\n\nWhen browsing in Plone, you will see that there is a 'subtypes' menu visible\nin the folder actions bar.\n\nYou can click on this menu and then choose 'Aggregator' to change your folder\ninto an aggregator.\n\nOn reload, the Folder will now have a new view, with nothing in it, because \nnothing is yet aggregated. You will notice a new object tab labeled\n'Aggregation'. You can click on it, and find the form for configuring you\naggregator. \n\nThe values you specify will basically be used to construct a catalog query,\nthat fetches the objects for you.\n\nIf correctly configured, your folder's view should now show a batched listing\nof the aggregated objects.\n\nKnown Issues:\n=============\n\nTo use the aggregator in a multi-language site, you have to subtype all the\ntranslations of a folder.\n\nSince subtyping doesn't take translations into account, this has to be done\nmanually.\n\nWe will eventually release a product called slc.linguatools, that would among\nother things allow you to subtype multiple translations simultaneously.\n\n\nDependencies:\n=============\n\n    - p4a.common\n    - p4a.z2utils\n    - p4a.subtyper\n    - archetypes.schemaextender\n    - Products.AdvancedQuery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.2 - (2009-11-17)\n------------------\n\n* Render the body text instead of the description if the aggregated object is a HelpCenterFAQFolder (jcbrand)\n* Fixed a bug while parsing the form request in browser/aggregator.py (jcbrand)\n\n1.2 - (2009-11-17)\n------------------\n\n* Register a new descriptor for PloneHelpCenterFAQFolder (jcbrand)\n* Autoinclude zcml via z3c.autoinclude.plugin (jcbrand)\n\n1.1 - (2009-10-21)\n------------------\n\n* Add a new form field 'restrict_language' to make language specific aggregation of items optional.

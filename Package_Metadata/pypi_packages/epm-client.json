Further documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/tub-elastest/epm-client-python/blob/master/docs/index.md).\n\nThe ElasTest Platform Manager (EPM) is the interface between the ElasTest testing components (e.g. TORM, Test Support Services, etc.) and the cloud infrastructure where ElasTest is deployed. Hence, this Platform Manager must abstract the cloud services so that ElasTest becomes fully agnostic to them and provide this abstraction via Software Development Toolkits (SDK) or REST APIs to the northbound consumers (i.e. the TORM). The ElasTest Platform Manager enabling ElasTest to be deployed and to execute seamlessly in the target cloud infrastructure that the consortium considers as appropriate (e.g. OpenStack, CloudStack, Mantl, AWS, etc.).\n\nThe ElasTest Platform Manager component is currently in development. If you want to contribute to the this project you need to read the [Development documentation](https://github.com/elastest/elastest-platform-manager/blob/master/docs/index.md) \n\nWhat is ElasTest\n-----------------\n\nThis repository is part of [ElasTest], which is an open source elastic platform\naimed to simplify end-to-end testing. ElasTest platform is based on three\nprinciples: i) Test orchestration: Combining intelligently testing units for\ncreating a more complete test suite following the \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d principle.\nii) Instrumentation and monitoring: Customizing the SuT (Subject under Test)\ninfrastructure so that it reproduces real-world operational behavior and allowing\nto gather relevant information during testing. iii) Test recommendation: Using machine\nlearning and cognitive computing for recommending testing actions and providing\ntesters with friendly interactive facilities for decision taking.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe [ElasTest] project provides detailed documentation including tutorials,\ninstallation and development guide.\n\nSource\n------\n\nSource code for other ElasTest projects can be found in the [GitHub ElasTest\nGroup].\n\nNews\n----\n\nFollow us on Twitter @[ElasTest Twitter].\n\nLicensing and distribution\n--------------------------\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n  http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\nContribution policy\n-------------------\n\nYou can contribute to the ElasTest community through bug-reports, bug-fixes,\nnew code or new documentation.

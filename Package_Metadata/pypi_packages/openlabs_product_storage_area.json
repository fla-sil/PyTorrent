You could create each\nbin in your warehouse and track inventory for each of those bins.\n\nThe ``stock_product_location`` module allows you to specify preferred\nlocations for products in your warehouse helping you move products in and\nout of the right bins (or aisles).\n\nSo why build this module ?\n--------------------------\n\nFrom our experience, tracking and managing inventory at the bin level\noften requires dedicated man power and man hours to stay accurate. Small\nbusinesses may not want to invest time into this, but may want to keep\ntrack of where products are usually kept in the warehouse. This\ninformation can help the new picker find the product and the restocker to\nput the product in the right place, instead of spreading it around the\nwarehouse.\n\nSo, this module gives a light weight option where you can create ``storage\nareas`` and tag them with products.

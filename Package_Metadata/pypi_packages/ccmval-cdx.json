It does so by allowing you to specify a ``cdx:`` style URL\nin your diagnostic ``namelist`` file in place of a regular local filesystem\npath.\n\nWhat You Get\n============\n\nIn this distribution you'll find:\n\nccmval\n    The beta9 version of the CCMValDiag code taken from its\n    `subversion repository`_ *including* enhancements by CDX.\nREADME.txt\n    This file.\nsetup.py\n    Standard distutils_ and setuptools_ metadata.\nsetup.cfg\n    Standard configuration for distutils_ and setuptools_.\n\n\nDependencies\n============\n\nThe enhancements to CCMValDiag rely on the cdx.client package.  You can learn\nmore about cdx.client at this address::\n\n    http://cdx.jpl.nasa.gov/software/cdx-client\n    \nor by reviewing its Python Package Index (\"Cheeseshop\") entry at::\n\n    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cdx.client/\n    \nSee either website for detailed installation instructions. To see if your\nPython installation already has the cdx.client package, try running\n``python`` and enter the following:\n\n    >>> import cdx.client\n\nIf you receive an ImportError, you'll need to install cdx.client.\n\n\nUse\n===\n\nFor use of CCMValDiag, consult the README* files in the ``ccmval`` directory.\n(JPL is solely responsible for the enhancements that enable reading from CDX\nproduct servers and, unfortunately, cannot assist you with running of\nCCMValDiag.)\n\nThe input models for CCMValDiag are specified as filesystem path names in a\n\"namelist\" file.  You create a namelist file to identify input models,\nvariables to validate, plot types, and so forth.  To query from CDX, you\nreplace the filesystem path name with a ``cdx:`` URL.\n\nHere is an example ``cdx:`` URL::\n\n    cdx://jpl-esg.jpl.nasa.gov:8080/cdxesg/prod/commit/atm/da/hfls/pr/ncar_ccsm3_0/run1\n    \nLet's look at each part of this URL.\n\ncdx:\n    This is the URL scheme. It should *always* be ``cdx:``\njpl-esg.jpl.nasa.gov:8080\n    This is the net location of the CDX product server.  In this case, we're\n    access the host called ``jpl-esg.jpl.nasa.gov`` and the server listening\n    on port number 8080.\ncdxesg\n    This is the web endpoint to use.  It identifies a particular web\n    application on the server listening on port 8080, in this case ``cdxesg``.\n    Each CDX product server is differentiated by its web endpoint.\nprod\n    This string indicates we want to access the product service.  It should\n    *always* be ``prod``.\n/commit/atm/da/hfls/pr/ncar_ccsm3_0/run1\n    This identifies the path *within the product server* of the data to\n    access.  In this case, this path references three NetCDF files on the\n    product server that live in the ``run1`` directory (which lives in the\n    ``ncar_ccsm3_0`` directory, and so forth).\n\nBy placing such a URL in the MODELS section of a namelist file, CCMValDiag\nwill be able to work its magic on CDX data.\n\nFor an example namelist that uses CDX URLs, see the ``namelist_cdx`` file in\nthe ``ccmval`` directory.\n\n\n\n\n..

Traditionally, pedotransfer functions are represented as expressions (formulas) and that is why [symbolic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_regression) is a great alternative to develop them.\n\nThis project wouldn't be possible without the great [glplearn](https://github.com/trevorstephens/gplearn) library, which implements Symbolic regression. In Trevor's words:\n> Symbolic regression is a machine learning technique that aims to identify an underlying mathematical expression that best describes a relationship. It begins by building a population of naive random formulas to represent a relationship between known independent variables and their dependent variable targets in order to predict new data.

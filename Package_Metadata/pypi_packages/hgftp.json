If you have your website (.html, .php, etc.) under mercurial control you can easily upload snapshots to your provider. If you change something on your site you only need to upload the difference of the last uploaded snapshot and the current/selected revision without to do it yourself.\n        \n        1. Add your website files to mercurial\n        2. Upload initial snapshot to ftp server (set ``uploaded@host`` tag)\n        3. Do many commits to your website files\n        4. Upload only new/changed files to your last uploaded snapshot (and remove vanished files)\n        \n        Really useful if you use a modified version of existing open source wikis/forums/cms and wants to be in sync with upstream changes.\n        \n        Just commit upstream changes to branch ``vanilla`` and your modified version will be in ``default``. So you can merge it on new upstream versions and use this extension to upload your synced snapshot.\n        \n        =======\n        CHANGES\n        =======\n        \n        -------------------\n        v0.1.1 (2014-08-23)\n        -------------------\n        \n        * Added this CHANGES file and a description for PyPI (devurandom)\n        \n        \n        -----------------\n        v0.1 (2014-08-23)\n        -----------------\n        \n        First packaged version.

This wrapper is aimed at analysts whom want to get up and running very quickly to price and compute risk on CDS using either Python or C++ calling code. The measures computed support a range of potential analysis including:\n\n + PVDirty, PVClean & Accrued Interest to support NAV calculations & back tests.\n + CS01 & DV01 sensitivities for risk exposure & limit monitoring analysis.\n + Roll sensitivities over range of dates.\n + PVBP sensitivities to support credit risk hedging analysis.\n + Index CDS Pricing from constituent level.\n\nPotential future measures might include Equivalent Notional, Par Spread and Risky CS01, these measures are likely to be added as part of the next full release candidate.\n\n## Intrinsic CDX or iTraxx pricing.\n\nHigh performance pricing of CDX or iTraxx index trades can be achieved using the latest cds_index_all_in_one call. This new method supports passing a vector or recovery rates and \nunderlying index constituent spread curves to compute the intrinsic price of an index CDS trade. This also support computing the skew and skew adjustment for an index trade. \n\nThe example shows how credit_spread_list and recovery_rate_list can be passed into the pricing call. You can easily get started using these examples using the simple pip wheel binary packages.\n\n```\n$pip install isda\n```\n\nExample code to compute intrinsic price of CDS or iTraxx index.\n\n```\n\ndef test_sell_protection_index(self):\n        \"\"\" method to specifically price an index cds \"\"\"\n\n        self.sdate = datetime.datetime(2018, 1, 8)\n        self.value_date = self.sdate.strftime('%d/%m/%Y')\n        self.verbose = 0\n        self.is_buy_protection = 0\n\n        # simulate an index with 125 names;; \n        self.credit_spread_list = [self.credit_spreads]*125\n        self.recovery_rate_list = [self.recovery_rate]*125\n\n        # build imm_dates TODO: hide this away internally?\n        self.imm_dates = [f[1] for f in imm_date_vector(\n            start_date=self.sdate, tenor_list=self.tenor_list)]\n\n        wall_time_list = list()\n        for i in range(0,20):\n            f = cds_index_all_in_one(self.trade_date,\n                                   self.effective_date,\n                                   self.maturity_date,\n                                   self.value_date,\n                                   self.accrual_start_date,\n                                   self.recovery_rate_list,\n                                   self.coupon,\n                                   self.notional,\n                                   self.is_buy_protection,\n                                   self.swap_rates,\n                                   self.swap_tenors,\n                                   self.swap_maturity_dates,\n                                   self.credit_spread_list,\n                                   self.credit_spread_tenors,\n                                   self.spread_roll_tenors,\n                                   self.imm_dates,\n                                   self.scenario_shifts,\n                                   self.verbose) \n\n            pv_dirty, pv_clean, ai, duration_in_milliseconds = f[1]\n```\n\n## How do I get started with the Python3 version? \n\nThe 1.0.3 branch plays very nicely with Python3 and has been upgraded to compile cleanly with MSVC using the Visual Studio 2017 vintage. We have also made a pip package available on pypi.org with a pre-compiled binary wheel\nthat targets windows. This windows binary wheel has been published to both pypi and testpypi and is now available for public download. \n\nFrom a windows desktop using python3 you can use the following commands to test the installation. The test below asserts the average price of an index CDS priced from 125 separate underlying names.\nThe average wall time locally running on my Intel(T) i5 2.4GHz is around 415 milliseconds. This is not particularly fast and includes no caching and two separate calls for PV Dirty and PV Clean.\n\n### How can I testing the isda Wheel package on Windows?\n\n```\n$python -m venv test1\n$cd test1\n$Scripts\\activate.bat\n$cd test1\n$pip install isda\n$copy Lib\\site-packages\\isda\\tests\\TestCdsPricerIndex.py\n$python TestCdsPricerIndex.py\n\nYou should output to the screen that looks like below.\n\n(test1) C:\\sandbox\\test5>python TestCdsPricerIndex.py\ncob_date: 08/01/2018 pv_dirty: -2792.666875 pv_clean: -2797.527986 ai: 4.861111 wall_time: 422.0 (ms)\ncob_date: 08/01/2018 pv_dirty: -2792.666875 pv_clean: -2797.527986 ai: 4.861111 wall_time: 422.0 (ms)\ncob_date: 08/01/2018 pv_dirty: -2792.666875 pv_clean: -2797.527986 ai: 4.861111 wall_time: 423.0 (ms)\ncob_date: 08/01/2018 pv_dirty: -2792.666875 pv_clean: -2797.527986 ai: 4.861111 wall_time: 409.0 (ms)\ncob_date: 08/01/2018 pv_dirty: -2792.666875 pv_clean: -2797.527986 ai: 4.861111 wall_time: 428.0 (ms)\ncob_date: 08/01/2018 pv_dirty: -2792.666875 pv_clean: -2797.527986 ai: 4.861111 wall_time: 414.0 (ms)\ncob_date: 08/01/2018 pv_dirty: -2792.666875 pv_clean: -2797.527986 ai: 4.861111 wall_time: 416.0 (ms)\nfactoral 120\naverage execution (415.4,)\n.\nRan 1 test in 8.319s\n\nOK\n\n(test1) C:\\sandbox\\test1>\n```\n\n### Is the wheel sensitive to Python version? \n\nCurrently we have published only 3.7 Python wheel for windows, however we plan to extend this to cover 3.5 & 3.6. \n\n### Does the package work nicely with artifactory?\n\n\n\n### How can I get a quick introduction to the module? \n\nThe module has a single isda namespace, which consists of two separate namespaces; the core isda.isda for pricing and risk and the isda.imm for a library that can generate imm date vectors.\nThe cds_all_in_one call is used to support pricing and risk from a single vector of credit spreads on a Single Name or Index CDS and cds_index_all_in_one has been added to support fast index\nlookthrough pricing. This second method does not yet deliver a risk resultset.\n\n```python\nfrom isda.isda import cds_all_in_one, cds_index_all_in_one\nfrom isda.imm import imm_date_vector\n```\n\n## 1.0.3 Release Notes\n\nNumber of changes have gone into the 1.0.3 release to promote stability and performance. The main changes are listed as below.\n\n0. put back all logic for remaining methods & solve calling cl.exe from the setup.py dist which should work \nas expected. Then re-test on windows & linux with Python 3.6.\n\n1. Additional cds_index_all_in_one which can price a whole Credit index in a single call to the library. This avoid excessive calls to the single name pricer. The new call can accept an array of recovery rates and an array of array of credit spread curves. All other inputs are assumed constant across the index credits. This call can be used to implement a more efficient skew solver.\n\n2. change in behaviour of return f[0] versus f[1] tuple; constituents versus the index.\n\n```\nC:\\github\\CreditDefaultSwapPricer\\x64>python TestCdsPricerRR.py\n.cob_date: 08/01/2018 pv_dirty: -2792.67 pv_clean: -2797.53 ai: 4.86 wall_time: 421.0 (ms)\n```\n\n3. Included a new feature to handle the case when spread curve bootstrapping fails. The recovery rate is stepped down one basis point at a time until a bootstrappable curve is achievable this is often a problem in a high stress scenario when the recovery rate and perturbated spread curves are not consistently known.\n\n4. Resolved number of compile errors related to the comparison of unsigned and signed integers.\n\n5. The isda.i swig interface has changed and required separate compilation using the swig command line utility.\n\n```\nswig -c++ -python isda.i\n```\n\n6. integration with MSVC Visual Studio 2017 vintage cl.exe compiler. This meant a complete re-write of several parts of the underlying c++ code and new switches to activate c++11 on Linux. Several new build switches have been introduced as a result to support the deployment on windows and linux.\n## Python3 Migration\n\nThe codebase and build scripts rely on Python2.7; we plan to migrate to Python3 and include a setup.py to make the install more consistent and play nicely with pip. The migration path was presumed to be easier with a switch to a proper setup.py. This also makes the migration to use pip potentially easier and more consistent with the general Python ecosystem.\n\n## Par Spread Vector from flat Credit Spread\n\nAdditional code has been added the all_in_one_cds method to invoke the JpmCdscdsParSpread() to compute par spreads. The internal call re-uses the swap_spread tenor list as the par spread tenors and will compute a par spread for each tenor. The vector of par spreads is then returned in an additional vector across the results interface and can easily be accessed in Python as shown below. \n\n```\ncredit_spreads = [0.00137467867844589]*8\nswap_tenors = ['1M', '2M', '3M', '6M', '9M', '1Y', '2Y', '3Y', \n            '4Y', '5Y', '6Y', '7Y', '8Y', '9Y, \n            '10Y', '15Y', '20Y', '30Y']\n\nf = cds_all_in_one(trade_date,\n\teffective_date,\n\tmaturity_date,\n\tvalue_date,\n\taccrual_start_date,\n\trecovery_rate,\n\tcoupon,\n\tnotional,\n\tis_buy_protection,\n\tswap_rates,\n\tswap_tenors,\n\tswap_maturity_dates,\n\tcredit_spreads,\n\tcredit_spread_tenors,\n\tspread_roll_tenors,\n\timm_dates,\n\tscenario_shifts,\n\tverbose)\n\n# expand tuple\npv_dirty, pv_clean, ai, cs01, dv01, duration_in_milliseconds = f[0]\npvbp6m, pvbp1y, pvbp2y, pvbp3y, pvbp4y, pvbp5y, pvbp7y, pvbp10y = f[1]\nps_1m, ps_2m, ps_3M, ps_6M, ps_9M, ps_1Y, ps_2Y, ps_3Y, ps_4Y, ps_5Y, ps_6Y, ps_7Y, ps_8Y, ps_9Y, ps_10Y = f[2]\n\nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274826727324, ps_1m) \nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274883148583, ps_2m) \nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274929868985, ps_3M) \nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274939866579, ps_6M) \nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274936653181, ps_9M) \nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274937754343, ps_1Y)\nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274932944417, ps_2Y) \nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274932454643, ps_3Y) \nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274932165857, ps_4Y) \nassertAlmostEquals(0.0027493199385, ps_5Y)\nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274926894167, ps_6Y) \nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274932296072, ps_7Y) \nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274925367015, ps_8Y) \nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274927195173, ps_9Y) \nassertAlmostEquals(0.00274933238284, ps_10Y)\n\n```\nAn additional unittest test_sell_protection_par_spread has been added that shows how these can be accessed in the flat spread case. Above illustrates the simple case where we price an index from a flat spread 13.7 bps and compute a similarly flat par spread at each tenor.\n\n## UnitTest framework\n\nA new TestCdsPricer class has been added to the project which aims to lock in the behaviour of the CDS model relative to the approved MarkIT partners calculator. Since the rules of how to wire together the internal ISDA model api calls can introduce potential error; being able to confirm that the exact behaviour converges with the approved model is essential. \n\nThe test cases are setup to asset values that have been hand validated to 11 decimal places with the MarkIT and BBG calculators. The signs have also been validated against market convension.\n\n```\nself.assertAlmostEquals(-1.23099324435, pv_dirty)\nself.assertAlmostEquals(-1.19210435546, pv_clean)\nself.assertAlmostEquals(0.0388888888889, ai)\nself.assertAlmostEquals(14014.5916905, cs01 * 1.0e6)\nself.assertAlmostEquals(131.61798715, dv01 * 1.0e6)\n\n```\n\n### Unit test results\n\nThe output above details five core tests output from the pricer; these are the net present value with accrued (pv_dirty), the associated clean npv and accrued. The sum of which, clean plus accrued should match the dirty pv or price. Finally two sensitivities are validated, credit spread and interest rate movements.\n\n## Getting Started on Windows\n\nThis repo includes a make.bat file intended to build the project on most Windows platforms. The make.bat file requires that you first download and install the first two items in the list below. You might already have Python27 installed, the make.bat file assumes this is installed in the normal C:\\Python27\\ location as well as a POSIX compliant compiler, MinGW. Microsoft Visual C++ compile cl.exe was tested but comes with a large number of language differences and windows specific issues. MinGW offers a cleaner migration path from Linux to the Windows platform.\n\n+ [Python Installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/)\n+ [MinGW Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-setup.exe/download?use_mirror=kent&r=https%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fmingw%2Ffiles%2FInstaller%2F&use_mirror=kent)\n+ [Swig Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/?source=typ_redirect)\n\n### Steps to Test \n\nUse the following steps to clone, make and then finally test the project.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/bakera1/CreditDefaultSwapPricer.git\ncd CreditDefaultSwapPricer\nmake.bat\n```\n\nThe build step should result in the _isda.pyd and isda.py file being copied into the cds directory. You can then test the binary with the following steps\n\n```\npython isda_test.py\n```\n\nThe following example output should then be shown on the console from the Python script.\n\n```\nC:\\github\\CreditDefaultSwapPricer\\cds>python isda_test.py\n23/01/2018      pv_dirty (-1.07226)     cs01 (-8298.48) dv01 (-9.87001e-05)     pvbp5y 0.00049088    5yeqnot (16.9053)  1day roll (-1806.69)    time (32.0)\n24/01/2018      pv_dirty (-1.0707)      cs01 (-8286.24) dv01 (-9.78226e-05)     pvbp5y 0.000490599   5yeqnot (16.8901)  1day roll (-1773.74)    time (51.0)\n25/01/2018      pv_dirty (-1.06917)     cs01 (-8274.28) dv01 (-9.78311e-05)     pvbp5y 0.000490335   5yeqnot (16.8747)  1day roll (-5329.83)    time (60.0)\n26/01/2018      pv_dirty (-1.06457)     cs01 (-8238.78) dv01 (-9.78402e-05)     pvbp5y 0.000489523   5yeqnot (16.8302)  1day roll (-1798.08)    time (66.0)\n29/01/2018      pv_dirty (-1.06302)     cs01 (-8226.13) dv01 (-9.69741e-05)     pvbp5y 0.000489267   5yeqnot (16.8132)  1day roll (-1784.68)    time (64.0)\n30/01/2018      pv_dirty (-1.06148)     cs01 (-8214.07) dv01 (-9.66886e-05)     pvbp5y 0.000488996   5yeqnot (16.7978)  1day roll (-1806.4)     time (50.0)\n31/01/2018      pv_dirty (-1.05992)     cs01 (-8201.83) dv01 (-9.58224e-05)     pvbp5y 0.000488714   5yeqnot (16.7825)  1day roll (-1773.78)    time (37.0)\n01/02/2018      pv_dirty (-1.0584)      cs01 (-8189.87) dv01 (-9.58308e-05)     pvbp5y 0.000488455   5yeqnot (16.7669)  1day roll (-5329.87)    time (36.0)\n02/02/2018      pv_dirty (-1.05379)     cs01 (-8154.38) dv01 (-9.58399e-05)     pvbp5y 0.000487642   5yeqnot (16.7221)  1day roll (-1797.88)    time (32.0)\n05/02/2018      pv_dirty (-1.05225)     cs01 (-8141.73) dv01 (-9.4985e-05)      pvbp5y 0.000487387   5yeqnot (16.7049)  1day roll (-1784.61)    time (35.0)\n06/02/2018      pv_dirty (-1.05071)     cs01 (-8129.68) dv01 (-9.47032e-05)     pvbp5y 0.000487119   5yeqnot (16.6893)  1day roll (-1806.11)    time (33.0)\n07/02/2018      pv_dirty (-1.04915)     cs01 (-8117.44) dv01 (-9.38483e-05)     pvbp5y 0.000486838   5yeqnot (16.6738)  1day roll (-1773.82)    time (31.0)\n08/02/2018      pv_dirty (-1.04762)     cs01 (-8105.49) dv01 (-9.38566e-05)     pvbp5y 0.000486574   5yeqnot (16.6583)  1day roll (-5329.91)    time (41.0)\n09/02/2018      pv_dirty (-1.04302)     cs01 (-8069.99) dv01 (-9.38657e-05)     pvbp5y 0.000485761   5yeqnot (16.6131)  1day roll (-1797.68)    time (36.0)\n12/02/2018      pv_dirty (-1.04148)     cs01 (-8057.36) dv01 (-9.3022e-05)      pvbp5y 0.000485506   5yeqnot (16.5958)  1day roll (-1784.55)    time (33.0)\n13/02/2018      pv_dirty (-1.03994)     cs01 (-8045.31) dv01 (-9.27439e-05)     pvbp5y 0.000485238   5yeqnot (16.5801)  1day roll (-1805.82)    time (36.0)\n\nC:\\github\\CreditDefaultSwapPricer\\cds>history\n\n```\n\n### Possible bug in Python pyconfig.h\n\nYou might see the following error message when executing the make.bat file on windows, if this is the case then I suggest that you make a small modification to work around this problem.\n\n[c:\\mingw\\lib\\gcc\\mingw32\\6.3.0\\include\\c++\\cmath:1157:11: error: '::hypot' has not been declared](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42276984/hypot-has-not-been-declared)\n\nEdit the file C:\\Python27\\include\\pyconfig.h to comment out line #286 as below; this allows the compilation and linking to complete.\n\n```\n#if (__GNUC__==2) && (__GNUC_MINOR__<=91)\n#warning \"Please use an up-to-date version of gcc!

Whilst this is fine for most uses; when you need precision pricing quickly and easily that conforms exactly to the ISDA CDS model then this wrapper allows you to very quickly build and start writing code Python and price and compute risk on real CDS positions.\n\n1. Is this not just another CDS pricier?\n\n   This library is really only a thin wrapper around the underlying [ISDA CDS Pricing library](http://www.cdsmodel.com/cdsmodel/). The complexity of wiring the spread, interest rate and pricing routines together with some array passing and imm date logic completes an integration task. None of these steps is particularly difficult but together they build a barrier to adoption of the ISDA CDS pricier. By making this library available to use along side the existing [ISDA CDS pricier](http://www.cdsmodel.com/cdsmodel/) it is hoped to lower the barrier and make adoption much easier.\n\n2. Is the only system that can model the weather really only the weather?\n\n   If what you need is safe accurate ISDA pricing then why settle for anything other than the ISDA pricier? however using this CDS pricier avoids the hastle of figuring out all the correct C functions to call and how to pass objects easily into these extern \"C\" style functions with double* and variety of custom typedef objects like TDateInterval. I just want to create a datetime and pass this into a function right!\n\n## How do I get started? \n\nThe module can be downloaded along with a suitable version of the [ISDA CDS Pricing library](http://www.cdsmodel.com/cdsmodel/) using the make.sh script to invoke the [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) and gcc builds needed to generate and compile the wrapper and underlying code modules. The g++ invoke is also managed by this file which in turn builds the C++ wrapper ahead of linking the entire module into a library called isda. This libray can then be easily imported into the Python C runtime as shown below.\n\n```python\nfrom isda.isda import cds_all_in_one, cds_index_all_in_one\nfrom isda.imm import imm_date_vector\n```\n\n### CDS All In One\n\nOnce you have downloaded and built the project a simple function cds_all_in_one will provide a [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) wrapped C++ function that invokes the underlying C library functions from the [ISDA CDS model](http://www.cdsmodel.com/cdsmodel/). The interface has been constructed to make the usage as simple and easy as possible. Python native types are used and no custom objects are used. \n\n\n#### Array of Arrays\n\nThe return response of the cds_all_in_one call has been simplified to return a vector of vectors of doubles, effectively a list of jagged arrays or a jagged matrix. The primary reason being that the python code is much easier to manipulate as a list of tuple objects rather than just a tuple.\n\n+ base - list of primary pricing and risk measures\n+ pbvp - forward looking price array\n+ roll - array of roll down delta pv values \n+ bucket - array of bucketed cs01 values\n\n```python\n\nfrom isda import cds_all_in_one_exclude_ir_tenor_dates\nfrom imm import imm_date_vector\n\n# EUR interest rate curve\nswap_rates = [-0.00369, -0.00341, -0.00328, -0.00274, -0.00223, -0.00186, \n            -0.00128, 0.00046, 0.00217, 0.003, 0.00504,\n            0.00626, 0.00739, 0.00844, 0.00941, 0.01105, \n            0.01281, 0.01436, 0.01506]\nswap_tenors = ['1M', '2M', '3M', '6M', '9M', '1Y', '2Y', '3Y', \n            '4Y', '5Y', '6Y', '7Y', '8Y', '9Y, \n            '10Y', '15Y', '20Y', '30Y']\n\n# credit spread curve\ncredit_spreads = [0.00141154155739384] * 8\ncredit_spread_tenors = ['6M', '1Y', '2Y', '3Y', '4Y', '5Y', '7Y', '10Y']\n\n# specify n roll tenor\nspread_roll_tenors = ['1D', '1W', '1M', '2M', '3M', '4M', '6M', '1Y', '2Y', '3Y', '5Y']\nscenario_shifts = [-50, -10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300]\n\n# value asofdate\nsdate = datetime.datetime(2018, 1, 23)\nvalue_date = sdate.strftime('%d/%m/%Y')\n\n# economics of trade\nrecovery_rate = 0.4\ncoupon = 100\ntrade_date = '14/12/2017'\neffective_date = '15/12/2017'\nmaturity_date = '20/12/2011'\naccrual_start_date = '20/12/2017'\nnotional = 1.0 # 1MM EUR\nis_buy_protection = 0\n\n# holiday calender for EUR zone\nholiday = [datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 25).strftime('%d/%m/%Y'), \n    datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 24).strftime('%d/%m/%Y')]\n\n# numeric tenor list for imm_date_helper\ntenor_list = [0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10]\n\n# build imm_dates\nimm_dates = [f[1] for f in imm_date_helper(start_date=sdate,\n                                           tenor_list=tenor_list)]\n\n# call to cds_all_in_one\nbase, pvbp, roll, bucket = cds_all_in_one_exclude_ir_tenor_dates(trade_date,\n                           effective_date,\n                           maturity_date,\n                           value_date,\n                           accrual_start_date,\n                           recovery_rate,\n                           coupon,\n                           notional,\n                           is_buy_protection,\n                           swap_rates,\n                           swap_tenors,\n                           credit_spreads,\n                           credit_spread_tenors,\n                           spread_roll_tenors,\n                           imm_dates,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   scenario_shifts,\n                           holiday,\n                           verbose)\n\n# expand return arrays base, pvbp, roll & bucket into discrete variables\npv_dirty, pv_clean, ai, cs01, dv01, duration_in_milliseconds = base\npvbp6m, pvbp1y, pvbp2y, pvbp3y, pvbp4y, pvbp5y, pvbp7y, pvbp10y = pvbp\nroll1d, roll1w, roll1m, roll2m, roll3m, roll4m, roll6m, roll1y, roll2y, roll3y, roll5y = roll\nbucket_cs01_6m, bucket_cs01_1y, bucket_cs01_2y, bucket_cs01_3y, bucket_cs01_4y, bucket_cs01_5y, bucket_cs01_7y, bucket_cs01_10y = bucket\n\n```\n\n#### Pricing & Risk Measures ####\n\nThe cds_all_in_one function call returns a tuple of measures in a positional format, these are detailed as below.\n\n+ pv_dirty -

For this reason this module ships with an imm_date_helper class that takes all the effort away. \n\n1. imm_date_helper \n\n   The imm_date_helper function has been written and tested for the explicit purpose of providing accurate IMM dates that comply fully with the CDS market convention. Using the imm_date_helper function you can easily bootstrap the necessary IMM date vector for any business date. \n\n2. [semi-annual roll](https://www.isda.org//2015/12/10/updated-faq-amend-single-name-on-the-run-frequency) \n\n   Since 2015 IMM date logic for CDS contracts has changed to a [semi-annual roll](https://www.isda.org//2015/12/10/updated-faq-amend-single-name-on-the-run-frequency); this change impacts all future tenors along the CDS curve and should be accurately applied to ensure consistent CDS contract pricing.\n\n#### Example Semi-Annual IMM Date Roll\n\nThe example below shows how the IMM date roll logic is embedded accurately into the helper based on the semi annual roll, with a before and after roll date vector generated along the entire swap curve tenors. If you are pricing and need IMM dates before the ISDA 2015 semi annual roll change then this is automatically applied in the helper function. The function looks at the value of start_date parameter to determine if this latest rule needs to be applied.\n\n\n```python\n    def test_single_roll date_day_before_roll date(self):\n\n        # accepted results\n        real_result = [('6M', '20/06/2017'),\n                   ('1Y', '20/12/2017'),\n                   ('2Y', '20/12/2018'),\n                   ('3Y', '20/12/2019'),\n                   ('5Y', '20/12/2021'),\n                   ('7Y', '20/12/2023')]\n\n        sdate = datetime.datetime(2017, 3, 17)\n        tenor_list = [0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7]\n        local_result = imm_date_helper(start_date=sdate,\n                                 tenor_list=tenor_list,\n                                 format='%d/%m/%Y')\n\n\n        for (r,l) in zip(real_result, local_result):\n            self.assertTrue(r[0] == l[0] and r[1] == l[1])\n\n    def test_single_roll date_day_after_roll date(self):\n\n        # accepted results\n        real_result = [('6M', '20/12/2017'),\n                   ('1Y', '20/06/2018'),\n                   ('2Y', '20/06/2019'),\n                   ('3Y', '20/06/2020'),\n                   ('5Y', '20/06/2022'),\n                   ('7Y', '20/06/2024')]\n\n        sdate = datetime.datetime(2017, 3, 20)\n        tenor_list = [0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7]\n        local_result = imm_date_helper(start_date=sdate,\n                                 tenor_list=tenor_list,\n                                 format='%d/%m/%Y')\n\n        for (r,l) in zip(real_result, local_result):\n            self.assertTrue(r[0] == l[0] and r[1] == l[1])\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/bakera1/CreditDefaultSwapPricer/", "keywords": "credit derivative pricing risk", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "isda", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/isda/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/isda/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/bakera1/CreditDefaultSwapPricer/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/isda/1.0.9/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Package that delivers high performance pricing and risk for credit derivatives", "version": "1.0.9", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            # Credit Default Swap Pricer<br><br>Credit Default Swap Pricer project brings together the [ISDA CDS pricer](http://www.cdsmodel.com/cdsmodel/) and some new IMM date modules that are needed to make quick use of the underlying C library functions.

The isda.i swig interface has changed and required separate compilation using the swig command line utility.<br><br>```<br>swig -c++ -python isda.i<br>```<br><br>6. integration with MSVC Visual Studio 2017 vintage cl.exe compiler. This meant a complete re-write of several parts of the underlying c++ code and new switches to activate c++11 on Linux. Several new build switches have been introduced as a result to support the deployment on windows and linux.<br>## Python3 Migration<br><br>The codebase and build scripts rely on Python2.7; we plan to migrate to Python3 and include a setup.py to make the install more consistent and play nicely with pip. The migration path was presumed to be easier with a switch to a proper setup.py. This also makes the migration to use pip potentially easier and more consistent with the general Python ecosystem.<br><br>## Par Spread Vector from flat Credit Spread<br><br>Additional code has been added the all_in_one_cds method to invoke the JpmCdscdsParSpread() to compute par spreads. The internal call re-uses the swap_spread tenor list as the par spread tenors and will compute a par spread for each tenor. The vector of par spreads is then returned in an additional vector across the results interface and can easily be accessed in Python as shown below. <br><br>```<br>credit_spreads = [0.00137467867844589]*8<br>swap_tenors = ['1M', '2M', '3M', '6M', '9M', '1Y', '2Y', '3Y', <br>            '4Y', '5Y', '6Y', '7Y', '8Y', '9Y, <br>            '10Y', '15Y', '20Y', '30Y']<br><br>f = cds_all_in_one(trade_date,<br>\teffective_date,<br>\tmaturity_date,<br>\tvalue_date,<br>\taccrual_start_date,<br>\trecovery_rate,<br>\tcoupon,<br>\tnotional,<br>\tis_buy_protection,<br>\tswap_rates,<br>\tswap_tenors,<br>\tswap_maturity_dates,<br>\tcredit_spreads,<br>\tcredit_spread_tenors,<br>\tspread_roll_tenors,<br>\timm_dates,<br>\tscenario_shifts,<br>\tverbose)<br><br># expand tuple<br>pv_dirty, pv_clean, ai, cs01, dv01, duration_in_milliseconds = f[0]<br>pvbp6m, pvbp1y, pvbp2y, pvbp3y, pvbp4y, pvbp5y, pvbp7y, pvbp10y = f[1]<br>ps_1m, ps_2m, ps_3M, ps_6M, ps_9M, ps_1Y, ps_2Y, ps_3Y, ps_4Y, ps_5Y, ps_6Y, ps_7Y, ps_8Y, ps_9Y, ps_10Y = f[2]<br><br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274826727324, ps_1m) <br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274883148583, ps_2m) <br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274929868985, ps_3M) <br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274939866579, ps_6M) <br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274936653181, ps_9M) <br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274937754343, ps_1Y)<br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274932944417, ps_2Y) <br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274932454643, ps_3Y) <br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274932165857, ps_4Y) <br>assertAlmostEquals(0.0027493199385, ps_5Y)<br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274926894167, ps_6Y) <br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274932296072, ps_7Y) <br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274925367015, ps_8Y) <br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274927195173, ps_9Y) <br>assertAlmostEquals(0.00274933238284, ps_10Y)<br><br>```<br>An additional unittest test_sell_protection_par_spread has been added that shows how these can be accessed in the flat spread case.

The sum of which, clean plus accrued should match the dirty pv or price. Finally two sensitivities are validated, credit spread and interest rate movements.<br><br>## Getting Started on Windows<br><br>This repo includes a make.bat file intended to build the project on most Windows platforms. The make.bat file requires that you first download and install the first two items in the list below. You might already have Python27 installed, the make.bat file assumes this is installed in the normal C:\\Python27\\ location as well as a POSIX compliant compiler, MinGW. Microsoft Visual C++ compile cl.exe was tested but comes with a large number of language differences and windows specific issues. MinGW offers a cleaner migration path from Linux to the Windows platform.<br><br>+ [Python Installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/)<br>+ [MinGW Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-setup.exe/download?use_mirror=kent&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fmingw%2Ffiles%2FInstaller%2F&amp;use_mirror=kent)<br>+ [Swig Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/?source=typ_redirect)<br><br>### Steps to Test <br><br>Use the following steps to clone, make and then finally test the project.<br><br>```<br>git clone https://github.com/bakera1/CreditDefaultSwapPricer.git<br>cd CreditDefaultSwapPricer<br>make.bat<br>```<br><br>The build step should result in the _isda.pyd and isda.py file being copied into the cds directory.

Whilst this is fine for most uses; when you need precision pricing quickly and easily that conforms exactly to the ISDA CDS model then this wrapper allows you to very quickly build and start writing code Python and price and compute risk on real CDS positions.<br><br>1. Is this not just another CDS pricier?<br><br>   This library is really only a thin wrapper around the underlying [ISDA CDS Pricing library](http://www.cdsmodel.com/cdsmodel/). The complexity of wiring the spread, interest rate and pricing routines together with some array passing and imm date logic completes an integration task. None of these steps is particularly difficult but together they build a barrier to adoption of the ISDA CDS pricier. By making this library available to use along side the existing [ISDA CDS pricier](http://www.cdsmodel.com/cdsmodel/) it is hoped to lower the barrier and make adoption much easier.<br><br>2. Is the only system that can model the weather really only the weather?<br><br>   If what you need is safe accurate ISDA pricing then why settle for anything other than the ISDA pricier? however using this CDS pricier avoids the hastle of figuring out all the correct C functions to call and how to pass objects easily into these extern \"C\" style functions with double* and variety of custom typedef objects like TDateInterval. I just want to create a datetime and pass this into a function right!<br><br>## How do I get started? <br><br>The module can be downloaded along with a suitable version of the [ISDA CDS Pricing library](http://www.cdsmodel.com/cdsmodel/) using the make.sh script to invoke the [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) and gcc builds needed to generate and compile the wrapper and underlying code modules. The g++ invoke is also managed by this file which in turn builds the C++ wrapper ahead of linking the entire module into a library called isda. This libray can then be easily imported into the Python C runtime as shown below.<br><br>```python<br>from isda.isda import cds_all_in_one, cds_index_all_in_one<br>from isda.imm import imm_date_vector<br>```<br><br>### CDS All In One<br><br>Once you have downloaded and built the project a simple function cds_all_in_one will provide a [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) wrapped C++ function that invokes the underlying C library functions from the [ISDA CDS model](http://www.cdsmodel.com/cdsmodel/). The interface has been constructed to make the usage as simple and easy as possible. Python native types are used and no custom objects are used. <br><br><br>#### Array of Arrays<br><br>The return response of the cds_all_in_one call has been simplified to return a vector of vectors of doubles, effectively a list of jagged arrays or a jagged matrix. The primary reason being that the python code is much easier to manipulate as a list of tuple objects rather than just a tuple.<br><br>+ base - list of primary pricing and risk measures<br>+ pbvp - forward looking price array<br>+ roll - array of roll down delta pv values <br>+ bucket - array of bucketed cs01 values<br><br>```python<br><br>from isda import cds_all_in_one_exclude_ir_tenor_dates<br>from imm import imm_date_vector<br><br># EUR interest rate curve<br>swap_rates = [-0.00369, -0.00341, -0.00328, -0.00274, -0.00223, -0.00186, <br>            -0.00128, 0.00046, 0.00217, 0.003, 0.00504,<br>            0.00626, 0.00739, 0.00844, 0.00941, 0.01105, <br>            0.01281, 0.01436, 0.01506]<br>swap_tenors = ['1M', '2M', '3M', '6M', '9M', '1Y', '2Y', '3Y', <br>            '4Y', '5Y', '6Y', '7Y', '8Y', '9Y, <br>            '10Y', '15Y', '20Y', '30Y']<br><br># credit spread curve<br>credit_spreads = [0.00141154155739384] * 8<br>credit_spread_tenors = ['6M', '1Y', '2Y', '3Y', '4Y', '5Y', '7Y', '10Y']<br><br># specify n roll tenor<br>spread_roll_tenors = ['1D', '1W', '1M', '2M', '3M', '4M', '6M', '1Y', '2Y', '3Y', '5Y']<br>scenario_shifts = [-50, -10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300]<br><br># value asofdate<br>sdate = datetime.datetime(2018, 1, 23)<br>value_date = sdate.strftime('%d/%m/%Y')<br><br># economics of trade<br>recovery_rate = 0.4<br>coupon = 100<br>trade_date = '14/12/2017'<br>effective_date = '15/12/2017'<br>maturity_date = '20/12/2011'<br>accrual_start_date = '20/12/2017'<br>notional = 1.0 # 1MM EUR<br>is_buy_protection = 0<br><br># holiday calender for EUR zone<br>holiday = [datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 25).strftime('%d/%m/%Y'), <br>    datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 24).strftime('%d/%m/%Y')]<br><br># numeric tenor list for imm_date_helper<br>tenor_list = [0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10]<br><br># build imm_dates<br>imm_dates = [f[1] for f in imm_date_helper(start_date=sdate,<br>                                           tenor_list=tenor_list)]<br><br># call to cds_all_in_one<br>base, pvbp, roll, bucket = cds_all_in_one_exclude_ir_tenor_dates(trade_date,<br>                           effective_date,<br>                           maturity_date,<br>                           value_date,<br>                           accrual_start_date,<br>                           recovery_rate,<br>                           coupon,<br>                           notional,<br>                           is_buy_protection,<br>                           swap_rates,<br>                           swap_tenors,<br>                           credit_spreads,<br>                           credit_spread_tenors,<br>                           spread_roll_tenors,<br>                           imm_dates,<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t   scenario_shifts,<br>                           holiday,<br>                           verbose)<br><br># expand return arrays base, pvbp, roll &amp;

For this reason this module ships with an imm_date_helper class that takes all the effort away. <br><br>1. imm_date_helper <br><br>   The imm_date_helper function has been written and tested for the explicit purpose of providing accurate IMM dates that comply fully with the CDS market convention. Using the imm_date_helper function you can easily bootstrap the necessary IMM date vector for any business date. <br><br>2. [semi-annual roll](https://www.isda.org//2015/12/10/updated-faq-amend-single-name-on-the-run-frequency) <br><br>   Since 2015 IMM date logic for CDS contracts has changed to a [semi-annual roll](https://www.isda.org//2015/12/10/updated-faq-amend-single-name-on-the-run-frequency); this change impacts all future tenors along the CDS curve and should be accurately applied to ensure consistent CDS contract pricing.<br><br>#### Example Semi-Annual IMM Date Roll<br><br>The example below shows how the IMM date roll logic is embedded accurately into the helper based on the semi annual roll, with a before and after roll date vector generated along the entire swap curve tenors. If you are pricing and need IMM dates before the ISDA 2015 semi annual roll change then this is automatically applied in the helper function.

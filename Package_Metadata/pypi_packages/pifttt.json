To use it,\npass in your key and the name of the event you want to trigger, as\nwell as any optional values (up to three). For example:\n```Python\nif_this(\n    key='super-secret',\n    event_name='name of event,\n    value1='So',\n    value2='long',\n    value3='and thanks for all the fish',\n)\n```\n\n## Return values and exceptions\n\nIn case of a successful response from IFTTT (i.e., a status code of 200),\nthe content of the response will be returned. Otherwise, an exception\nwill be raised. IFTTT is not very strict, therefore there is not\nmuch where to go wrong (for example, triggering a non-existent event\nor not send a value expected by an event will both be allowed).\n\nThese are the exceptions the package raises:\n\n### `HookRequestError(Exception)`\n\nA blanket exception raised when something went wrong with the request,\nbut not much information about the error was found.

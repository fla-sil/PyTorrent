Set up desired sensors and start collecting data.(_See below for setting up sensors_)\n\n##Setting Up Sensors\n1. Run command ```./teleceptorcmd poller```. This will begin to look for sensors via USB ports.\n2. Plug in your sensor through a USB port.\n  * Make sure you have the most current firmware for your sensor. (_See **Sensor Firmware**._)\n\n\n#Sensor Firmware\nSensor firmware can be found in the [firmware](https://github.com/visgence/teleceptor/tree/master/firmware) folder. Download the appropriate firmware for your type of sensor, and then upload it to your sensor.\n\n**Important:**\n* You will need to download aJSON and add it to your adruino IDE.\n* In the .ino file that you download for your firmware, change the uuid found in _static const char jsonData[ ]_ to be a unique name of your choosing.\n\n\n#Teleceptor Front-End Usage\n* To view sensor data that has been collected, click on a sensor under the _Sensors_ tab.\n* To look at a certain time period of data, select a range under the _Time Controls_ tab.\n  * :star: Specifc data can also be viewed by passing the mouse on the graph to observe data points and the time it was collected.\n  * :star2: By clicking and dragging on a certain part of _either_ graph, you can zoom-in on points.\n* Some information about the sensor is editable and will change the graph accordingly such as _Units_ or _Calibration_.\n  * Be sure to save after editing for the configuration information to be available later.\n  * _Metadata_ cannot be changed. However, you can change it in the firmware and then re-upload the firmware to the sensor.\n* If you download updates from teleceptor but and are not sure if the webpage is up-to-date as well, clear your web browser's cache:\n  * **Chrome:** Right-click in a blank spot on the page -> Inspect element -> Settings (gear symbol) -> Disable cache (while DevTools is open) -> Refresh the page\n * **Mozilla Firefox**: _ctrl+Shift+R_ will reload the page without cache and/or _ctrl+Shift+Delete_ -> Details -> Cache checkbox -> Clear Now\n\n\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/visgence/teleceptor/tarball/0.7.7", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/visgence/teleceptor", "keywords": null, "license": "GPL3", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "teleceptor", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/teleceptor/", "platform": "any", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/teleceptor/", "project_urls": {"Download": "https://github.com/visgence/teleceptor/tarball/0.7.7", "Homepage": "https://github.com/visgence/teleceptor"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/teleceptor/0.7.7/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Data collection web application for microcontrollers", "version": "0.7.7", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            #Teleceptor<br>####2014 Visgence Inc.<br>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>    (at your option) any later version.<br><br>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The system is based on a conversion from 3D spherical to 2D rectangular coordinates. For each spherical coordinate pair (theta,phi), a vector containing all voxels  in the radius is selected, and a number of values are computed, including statistical values (average, entropy, kurtosis) and morphological values (tissue thickness, distance to the central point, number of non-zero blocks). These values conform a two-dimensional image that can be computationally or even visually analysed.\n\nA new structural parametrization of MRI images has been added, using a modified hidden markov model to trace routes that follow minimal intensity change paths inside the brain, instead of the rectilinear paths used in typical SBM [4]. This file, currently only working in MATLAB, is contained in the file `hmmPaths.m`.\n\n\nInstallation\n----------------\n`mapBrain` is now available via `pypi` and can be installed directly from:\n\n```python\npip install mapBrain\n```\n\nOtherwise, copy the *.py files directly to the working directory, and import the library with `import mapBrain`. \n\nUsage\n-----------------\nThe Statistical Brain Mapping is structured as a class that can be invoked from every script. The simplest approach would be using: \n```python\nimport mapBrain\nimport nibabel as nib\n\nimg = nib.load('MRIimage.nii')\nsbm = mapBrain.SphericalBrainMapping()\nmap = sbm.doSBM(img.get_data(), measure='average', show=True)\n```\nTo-Do\n-----------------\n- Add support for functions as objects\n- Add support for different sampling methods\n\nReferences\n---------------------\n1.

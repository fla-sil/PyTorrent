It doesn't offer any special options by design.\nYou get a canvas and can draw on it, with a fix-sized black pen...that's it.\n\nIf you're looking for the more fancy stuff, there are a ton of good drawing applications out\nthere (gimp, inkscape, ...). \nGo pick one of them, e.g. if you need special brush shapes with dynamics attached.\n\nI try to keep pysketch as minimalistic as possible, such that I can concentrate on *what* I draw, instead of\n*how* I draw it.\n\nIdea\n====\n\nBasic influences for the design and implementation of pysketch were: gsumi/xink and the \"scribblesimple\" example\nfrom the pygtk distribution.\n\nInstalling\n==========\n\nFor installing ``pysketch``, you have to get root and then run the command\n\n::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\nStarting\n========\n\nAfter a successful installation, you can call ``pysketch`` from the command-line\n\n::\n\n    pysketch\n\nIt supports a few parameters, that get listed with the ``-h`` option (or ``--help``).\n\nDraw with the left mouse button held down, the right button erases with a larger pen size.

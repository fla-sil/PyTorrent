In other words, a\ngoose type is a frontend for Python's `metaclass hooks for custom\ninstance and subclass checks`_.\n\n\n.. _isinstance():\n    https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#isinstance\n\n.. _issubclass():\n    https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#issubclass\n\n.. _metaclass hooks for custom instance and subclass checks:\n    https://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/datamodel.html#customizing-instance-and-subclass-checks\n\n\n***********************\nRelation to duck typing\n***********************\n\nThis is related to `duck typing`_, and could even be interpreted as an\nimplementation of it, but it is subtly different.\n\nIn contrast with a type in a nominal_ or structural_ type system, a duck\ntype is defined by a partial structure or behavior that is checked at\nruntime.  In this sense, a goose type is the same.  However, duck typing\nis typically associated with one of two approaches that differ from\ngoose typing.\n\nOne approach to duck typing is to apply EAFP: assume that the input\nimplements the desired structure and behavior, and rely on error\nhandling (supplementing as needed) to deal with non-compliant input.\nThis is a fine approach for simple duck types and loose validation\nrequirements, but for interfaces that require strict checking of complex\ntype descriptions, the validation and error handling code can be\ncumbersome, littering a function and obscuring its essential\nfunctionality.\n\nAnother approach is to apply a form of nominal type checking at the\nlevel of attributes or methods, sometimes together with checking the\nmultiplicity of arguments.  By inspecting an object's attributes, it is\npossible to check for a combination of interface conditions, such as\nattribute names, method names, and argument multiplicities, before\ncommencing a destructive or expensive task.\n\nLike the latter approach, goose types are more useful when it is\ndesirable to perform complex validation up front.  With Goose Types,\ncomplex type checking code to be extracted from a function body into the\nbody of a goose type, leaving behind an invocation of `isinstance()`_ or\n`issubclass()`_.  In the sense that this is runtime checking of\ndesirable interface behavior, this is like duck typing.  However, unlike\nthe conventional \"walks\"/\"quacks\" tests of duck typing, this can be used\nfor checks that are exactly as extensive, specific, or generic as\nneeded, without littering the code of functions that merely need to\ninvoke a type check.\n\n\n.. _duck typing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing\n\n.. _isinstance():\n    https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#isinstance\n\n.. _issubclass():\n    https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#issubclass\n\n.. _nominal: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system\n\n.. _structural: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system\n\n\n*********\nChangelog\n*********", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/nisavid/goosetypes", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "UNKNOWN", "keywords": null, "license": "GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\n  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates\nthe terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public\nLicense, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\n\n  0.

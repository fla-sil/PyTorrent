Skew allows you to\n        | define different SKU ``schemes`` which are a particular encoding of a\n        | SKU. Skew then allows you to use this scheme pattern and regular\n          expressions\n        | based on the scheme pattern to identify and enumerate a resource or\n          set\n        | of resources.\n        \n        | At the moment, the the only available ``scheme`` is the ``ARN``\n          scheme.\n        | The ``ARN`` scheme uses the basic structure of\n        | `Amazon Resource\n          Names <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__\n          (ARNs) to assign a unique identifier to every AWS\n        | resource.\n        \n        An example ARN pattern would be:\n        \n        ::\n        \n            arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-12345678\n        \n        | This pattern identifies a specific EC2 instance running in the\n          ``us-west-2``\n        | region under the account ID ``123456789012``. The account ID is the\n          12-digit\n        | unique identifier for a specific AWS account as described\n        | `here <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html>`__.\n        To allow **skew** to find your account number, you need to create a **skew**\n        YAML config file.  By default, **skew** will look for your config file in\n        ``~/.skew`` but you can use the ``SKEW_CONFIG`` environment variable to tell *skew*\n        where to find your config file if you choose to put it somewhere else.  The\n        basic format of the *skew* config file is:\n        \n        .. code:: yaml\n        \n            ---\n              accounts:\n                \"123456789012\":\n                  profile: dev\n                \"234567890123\":\n                  profile: prod\n        \n        Within the ``accounts`` section, you create keys named after your 12-digit\n        account ID (as a string).  Within that, you must have an entry called *profile*\n        that lists the profile name this account maps to within your AWS credential\n        file.\n                  \n        \n        | The main purpose of skew is to identify resources or sets of resources\n        | across services, regions, and accounts and to quickly and easily\n          return the\n        | data associated with those resources. For example, if you wanted to\n          return\n        | the data associated with the example ARN above:\n        \n        .. code:: python\n        \n            from skew import scan\n        \n            arn = scan('arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-12345678')\n            for resource in arn:\n                print(resource.data)\n        \n        | The call to ``scan`` returns an ARN object which implements the\n        | `iterator\n          pattern <https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types>`__\n        | and returns a ``Resource`` object for each AWS resource that matches\n          the\n        | ARN pattern provided. The ``Resource`` object contains all of the data\n        | associated with the AWS resource in dictionary under the ``data``\n          attribute.\n        \n        | Any of the elements of the ARN can be replaced with a regular\n          expression.\n        | The simplest regular expression is ``*`` which means all available\n          choices.\n        | So, for example:\n        \n        .. code:: python\n        \n            arn = scan('arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:*:instance/*')\n        \n        | would return an iterator for all EC2 instances in the ``us-east-1``\n          region\n        | found in all accounts defined in the config file.\n        \n        | To find all DynamoDB tables in all US regions for the account ID\n          234567890123\n        | you would use:\n        \n        .. code:: python\n        \n            arn = scan('arn:aws:dynamodb:us-.*:234567890123:table/*')\n        \n        CloudWatch Metrics\n        ------------------\n        \n        | In addition to making the metadata about a particular AWS resource\n          available\n        | to you, ``skew`` also tries to make it easy to access the available\n          CloudWatch\n        | metrics for a given resource.\n        \n        | For example, assume that you had did a ``scan`` on the original ARN\n          above\n        | and had the resource associated with that instance available as the\n          variable\n        | ``instance``. You could do the following:\n        \n        .. code:: python\n        \n            >>> instance.metric_names\n            ['CPUUtilization',\n             'NetworkOut',\n             'StatusCheckFailed',\n             'StatusCheckFailed_System',\n             'NetworkIn',\n             'DiskWriteOps',\n             'DiskReadBytes',\n             'DiskReadOps',\n             'StatusCheckFailed_Instance',\n             'DiskWriteBytes']\n            >>>\n        \n        | The ``metric_names`` attribute returns the list of available\n          CloudWatch metrics\n        | for this resource. The retrieve the metric data for one of these:\n        \n        .. code:: python\n        \n            >>> instance.get_metric_data('CPUUtilization')\n            [{'Average': 0.134, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:04:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n             {'Average': 0.066, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:54:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n             {'Average': 0.066, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:09:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n             {'Average': 0.134, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:34:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n             {'Average': 0.066, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:19:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n             {'Average': 0.068, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:44:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n             {'Average': 0.134, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:14:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n             {'Average': 0.066, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:29:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n             {'Average': 0.132, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:59:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n             {'Average': 0.134, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:49:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n             {'Average': 0.134, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:39:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'}]\n            >>>\n        \n        You can also customize the data returned rather than using the default\n        settings:\n        \n        .. code:: python\n        \n            >>> instance.get_metric_data('CPUUtilization', hours=8, statistics=['Average', 'Minimum', 'Maximum'])\n            [{'Average': 0.132,\n              'Maximum': 0.33,\n              'Minimum': 0.0,\n              'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T10:54:00Z',\n              'Unit': 'Percent'},\n             {'Average': 0.134,\n              'Maximum': 0.34,\n              'Minimum': 0.0,\n              'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:04:00Z',\n              'Unit': 'Percent'},\n              ...,\n             {'Average': 0.066,\n              'Maximum': 0.33,\n              'Minimum': 0.0,\n              'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T08:34:00Z',\n              'Unit': 'Percent'},\n             {'Average': 0.134,\n              'Maximum': 0.34,\n              'Minimum': 0.0,\n              'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T08:04:00Z',\n              'Unit': 'Percent'}]\n            >>>\n        \n        Filtering Data\n        --------------\n        \n        | Each resource that is retrieved is a Python dictionary. Some of these\n          (e.g.\n        | an EC2 Instance) can be quite large and complex. Skew allows you to\n          filter\n        | the data returned by applying a `jmespath <http://jmespath.org>`__\n          query to\n        | the resulting data.

Skew allows you to<br>        | define different SKU ``schemes`` which are a particular encoding of a<br>        | SKU. Skew then allows you to use this scheme pattern and regular<br>          expressions<br>        | based on the scheme pattern to identify and enumerate a resource or<br>          set<br>        | of resources.<br>        <br>        | At the moment, the the only available ``scheme`` is the ``ARN``<br>          scheme.<br>        | The ``ARN`` scheme uses the basic structure of<br>        | `Amazon Resource<br>          Names &lt;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html&gt;`__<br>          (ARNs) to assign a unique identifier to every AWS<br>        | resource.<br>        <br>        An example ARN pattern would be:<br>        <br>        ::<br>        <br>            arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-12345678<br>        <br>        | This pattern identifies a specific EC2 instance running in the<br>          ``us-west-2``<br>        | region under the account ID ``123456789012``. The account ID is the<br>          12-digit<br>        | unique identifier for a specific AWS account as described<br>        | `here &lt;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html&gt;`__.<br>        To allow **skew** to find your account number, you need to create a **skew**<br>        YAML config file.  By default, **skew** will look for your config file in<br>        ``~/.skew`` but you can use the ``SKEW_CONFIG`` environment variable to tell *skew*<br>        where to find your config file if you choose to put it somewhere else.  The<br>        basic format of the *skew* config file is:<br>        <br>        .. code:: yaml<br>        <br>            ---<br>              accounts:<br>                \"123456789012\":<br>                  profile: dev<br>                \"234567890123\":<br>                  profile: prod<br>        <br>        Within the ``accounts`` section, you create keys named after your 12-digit<br>        account ID (as a string).  Within that, you must have an entry called *profile*<br>        that lists the profile name this account maps to within your AWS credential<br>        file.<br>                  <br>        <br>        | The main purpose of skew is to identify resources or sets of resources<br>        | across services, regions, and accounts and to quickly and easily<br>          return the<br>        | data associated with those resources. For example, if you wanted to<br>          return<br>        | the data associated with the example ARN above:<br>        <br>        .. code:: python<br>        <br>            from skew import scan<br>        <br>            arn = scan('arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-12345678')<br>            for resource in arn:<br>                print(resource.data)<br>        <br>        | The call to ``scan`` returns an ARN object which implements the<br>        | `iterator<br>          pattern &lt;https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types&gt;`__<br>        | and returns a ``Resource`` object for each AWS resource that matches<br>          the<br>        | ARN pattern provided.

Some of these<br>          (e.g.<br>        | an EC2 Instance) can be quite large and complex. Skew allows you to<br>          filter<br>        | the data returned by applying a `jmespath &lt;http://jmespath.org&gt;`__<br>          query to<br>        | the resulting data. If you aren't familiar with jmespath, check it<br>          out.<br>        | Its a very powerful query language for JSON data and has full support<br>          in<br>        | Python as well as a number of other languages such as Ruby, PHP, and<br>        | Javascript. It is also the query language used in the<br>        | `AWSCLI &lt;https://aws.amazon.com/cli/&gt;`__ so if you are familiar with<br>          the<br>        | ``--query`` option there, you can use the same thing with skew.<br>        <br>        | To specify a query to be applied to results of a scan, simply append<br>        | the query to the end of the ARN, separated by a ``|`` (pipe)<br>          character.<br>        | For example:<br>        <br>        ::<br>        <br>            arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-12345678|InstanceType<br>        <br>        | Would retrieve the data for this particular EC2 instance and would<br>          then<br>        | filter the returned data through the (very) simple jmespath query to<br>          which<br>        | retrieves the value of the attribute ``InstanceType`` within the data.<br>          The<br>        | filtered data is available as the ``filtered_data`` attribute of the<br>        | Resource object. The full, unfiltered data is still available as the<br>        | ``data`` attribute.<br>        <br>        More Examples<br>        -------------<br>        <br>        `Find Unattached<br>

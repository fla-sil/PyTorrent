At present it only supports *nix* like Operating System. Although its free, it is recommended that you don't abuse this program. \nCurrently supported site is [chia-anime](http://ww2.chia-anime.tv/) \n\n## Features\n\n1. Searching of anime by name.\n2. Downloading anime.\n3. Episodes playlist.\n4. Resuming downloads.\n5. Download progress.\n6. User-defined output folder.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nCurrently on *nix* like Operating Systems are supported.\n\nRequires Python 3.4+ and pip3 for installing and running.\n\nIt relies on Firefox headless mode, so make sure you have Firefox version > 56.0 installed, also **geckodriver** is needed, you can follow [Install geckodriver for firefox](https://askubuntu.com/questions/870530/how-to-install-geckodriver-in-ubuntu) to see how to download and configure it.\n\n*NOTE: This program is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 3.6*\n\n## Installation\n\n1.`$ pip3 install khed` : Recommended way to install, as it installs all the requirements.\n\n OR \n\n2. `$ git clone https://github.com/bnu123/Khed`: First clone this repository.\n\n   `$ pip3 install . `: Then install it.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis script requires arguments to run, passing script arguments is easy and this script does not have too many arguments.\nIt would be helpful for you if you remember that the backbone of this program is its searching functionality, almost every argument uses search internally.\n\n### Searching \n\n`-s` or `--search` argument is used for searching an anime.\ne.g.\n```\n$ khed --search=Boku\n\n==================================\nWELCOME, Your search results are : \n==================================\n1. Boku dake ga Inai Machi\n2. Boku no Hero Academia\n3. Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season\n4. Boku no Hero Academia 3rd Season\n5. Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken\n6. Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken OVA\n7. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\n8. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai Next\n9. Bokura ga Ita\n10. Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou\n11. Bokurano\n12. Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro\n\nDownload or access anime info, [y/n]? \n```\nFrom here you can also move-ahead and download any anime or get anime info.\n\n*NOTE: Sometimes the search will tell that no anime was found, you can try and then enter the Japanese name of the anime or try to shorten the name , e.g. use Bok instead of Boku no.*\n\n### Downloading\n\n`-d` or `--download` along with *other arguments* make for a powerful downloader.\n\n#### Basic usage \nFor downloading:  `$ khed -d=anime name`. Now as download uses search internally to lookup for the anime name, the first episode of the first anime (if found) will be downloaded.\ne.g. following the above example\n```\n$ khed --download=Boku\n```\nThis will download the first episode of `Boku dake ga Inai Machi` which is the anime at 1st index.\n\n#### Advanced usage\nGives a fine grained control over download. This script provides extra arguments along with the `--download` argument to get anime and episodes specifically.\ne.g.\n```\n$ khed --download=Boku --search-index=8 --range=3-5           : This will fetch the 8th (search-index) anime from the search\n                                                                result, and download episodes: 3, 4 and 5.\n\n                                                              : --search-index MUST be correct, if not, a huge error list will\n                                                                be shown, so it is recommended that you run --search on the \n                                                                anime name before downloading to see the --search-index.\n\n$ khed -d Boku -si 8 -r 3-4                                    : Short form for the above.\n\n$ khed -d Boku --folder=folder name                            : This specifies the folder to be downloaded to. folder \n                                                                 does not need to exist, but either must be an *absolute path*\n                                                                 or just a name.\n                                                                 e.g. /home/user/FOLDER_NAME OR Anime, and corresponding \n                                                                 folder will be created if they does not exist.\n\n$ khed -d Boku -r 3-4                                          : --search-index default is 1, so first anime selected.\n\n$ khed -d Boku -si 4                                           : --range default is 1, only 1st episode is downloaded.\n\n$ khed -d Boku                                                 : This is the basic usage, --range,--search-index default to 1.\n\ndefault folder is \"DownloadedAnime\" which will be create in your current directory, which is the directory you invoked the command with.\n\n```\n*NOTE `--range` specifies Episode numbers, i.e. `--range=10-20` will include Episode-10,11,12...20*\n\n### Information\n\nThis script also allows you to get the anime information. Getting information is similar to downloading an anime.\n\n```\n$ khed --info=Boku\n\nWelcome to the info section of anime\nAvailable info:\n\t1. english\n\t2. synonyms\n\t3. japanese\n\t4. type\n\t5. episodes\n\t6. status\n\t7. aired\n\t8. premiered\n\t9. genres\n\t10. duration\n\t11. rating\n\t12. plot\nEnter the info name: [[q] quit; [b] back; [d] download]\n```\nAs shown above, the available info can be used\n*Note: Unlike `--search` here the info name has to be typed to get the info e.g. `plot` will give the info rather than `12`.\nAlso, there is no use of `--range` as information is only about anime not about episodes, which is what range is for.*\n\nUsing info:\n```\n$ khed --info=Boku --search-index=4                   : Use the 4th anime result from search.\n$ khed -i Boku -si 4                                  : Short form\n\nHelpful if you wan't to know the durations of episodes, or number of episodes.\n```\n\nFOR THE FOLLOWING, NO EXTRA ARGUMENT MUST BE GIVEN, IT MAY RESULT IN ERROR.\n\n### Listing Genres\nYou can see the available genres and download under specific genres.\n\n### Most-popular\nYou can see and download the most-popular animes, although its subjective to website.\n\ne.g\n\n```\n$ khed --list-genres        OR      $ khed -l\n\n==================================\nWELCOME, Your search results are : \n==================================\n1.

Adventure\n... and many more\n```\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you get an error or have any feature request, go ahead and drop an issue. If you would like to work on the issues see the following.\n\n## Development\n\nDon't commit to master branch, instead create a branch and then open a new pull requests specifying in short what did you change. Also it is recommended to have single commit per file rather than single commit to multiple files, it helps in reviewing.\nAlso install the program as editable.\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/bnu123/Khed\n$ pip3 install -e .\n```\nSo that *no* re-installing has to be done if you made a change to the program.\n\n## Motivation And Future\n\nI made this program to learn about python programming and development in general, currently I am working on making it compatible with other Operating Systems.\nThis program is purely for education purpose, you are responsible for its use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "khed", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/khed/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/khed/", "project_urls": null, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/khed/0.0.2/", "requires_dist": ["beautifulsoup4", "bs4", "lxml", "requests", "selenium", "tqdm"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Free anime downloader, supporting resumable downloads and episodes playlist all at once.", "version": "0.0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            Khed<br>---<br>Khed is an easy to use, **Free anime downloader**, supporting episodes playlists and resumable downloads.

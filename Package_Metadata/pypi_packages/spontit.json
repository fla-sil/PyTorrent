To see your user ID in the app, tap the \"Profile\" tab. To see your user ID on the website, look at the top of the screen.\n\nYou can change your user ID at any time <a href=\"https://www.spontit.com/change_names\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\n#### Generate a Secret Key\n\nOnce you have made an account, generate a secret key <a href=\"https://spontit.com/secret_keys\">here</a>. You might have to re-authenticate.\n\n#### Push Notification UI Anatomy\n\nYou can change your user ID and display name at any time <a href=\"https://www.spontit.com/change_names\">here</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/joshwolff1/spontit_api/raw/master/images/main_channel_push.png\" /> \n</p>\n\nAbove we see a push notification sent to the main channel. Here, \"Josh Wolff\" is the first and last name of the user. The call to action is the displayed text. The image shown is the personal profile picture of the user. (You can change your profile image on the homepage of the website or on the iPhone app in the sidebar.) If the user opens the notification, they can open a link attached, if any, among other options (`help(SpontitResource)`). If they have an iPhone, they can forward the notification and share it through several other mediums.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/joshwolff1/spontit_api/raw/master/images/topic_push.png\" /> \n</p>\n\nAbove we see a push notification to a channel (separate from the main channel). Josh owns this channel, but as you can see, it looks like its own account. \"Dem 2020 Polls\" is the display name, the non-bold text is the call to action, and the image is the image set for the channel. Currently, we only support setting images for sub-channels on the iOS app. To set an image, go to the \"Create\" tab, select the desired channel, and click the camera icon.\n\n### Limitations\n\n#### Rate Limits\n\nEach channel (including the main channel) has an individual rate limit of 1 push per second. For example, you can push to your main channel and two other channels in the same second, but you cannot push 3 times to one channel in the same second.\n\nIf you exceed the rate limit, we will specify this in the response returned for the call to push.\n\n#### Note on Our Development Priorities\n\nWe prioritize development of the iOS application over the website. If at any time, we describe a feature and it does not seem to be on the website, it might only exist in the iOS application. Please email us at info {at} spontit {dot} io so that we can clarify this to you and other developers.

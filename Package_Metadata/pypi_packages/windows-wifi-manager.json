The issue with this profile is '__=__' at the end of the SSID name, did you ever think if some SSID's contain emoji's how will you type it in CMD ( ' ', \" \", :, etc. If these types of symbols are present in SSID name, then also it is very difficult) but we know that nothing is impossible, you can suppress this problem by using _escape characters like \\\\ or ^ to escape characters like \"\" and '' and many more_, **but this Application will list out all the saved Wi-Fi in sorted order and you just had to scroll down and choose the name of the Wi-Fi of whom you want to get the details and you will get all information of that profile including Security Key (Password).**\n\n![Wi-Fi detail of slected profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NihalAgarwal/Windows-Wi-Fi-Manager/master/images/image2.png)\n\nThe other benefit of this application is that **you can manually save the SSID name, Authentication, and Password of any Wi-Fi profile** and when your system comes under that Wi-Fi range, it will automatically get connected to that Wi-Fi network. For example, If you know someone\u2019s Wi-Fi details and that Wi-Fi is not in the range and your system is never connected to it before, then you can use this application and select the **_'Add Profile'_** option and then enter the details of that Wi-Fi profile, confirm it and details of that Wi-Fi profile will saved to your system and one day when your system detects the frequency of that Wi-Fi (or getting signals from that Wi-Fi Network) _it will automatically get connected, rather than asking for a password for the first time connection establishment_ (like we do for the first time when connecting to any Wi-Fi Network).\n\n![Adding Wi-Fi profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NihalAgarwal/Windows-Wi-Fi-Manager/master/images/image3.png)\n\n*If your system is flooded with too much of Wi-Fi profiles*, going to CMD and selecting the SSID name by typing '_netsh wlan show profiles_' and then selecting the profile and then use delete command with manually typing the SSID name and some time it doesn\u2019t get successful like I mention above that **some SSID\u2019s contain ambiguous name (like containing symbols, emojis within their name)** and it is very difficult for CMD to parse the command and find out the SSID name but in **_Windows Password Manager_** you can delete it in one click by selecting the Wi-Fi profile in the list and press delete button.\n\n![Successfully deleted a profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NihalAgarwal/Windows-Wi-Fi-Manager/master/images/image4.png)\n\n<p>If you are still having any confusion, give a try to Application and you will definitely know what I mean to say above.</p>\n\n## Issues\n\n#### Version = '0.1.0' :\n##### Bugs (Reported by the users):\n1.

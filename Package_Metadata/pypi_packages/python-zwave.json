Any hardware working with Z/IP Gateway should work with pyzwave. Z/IP Gateway requires the Z-Wave chip to be running the bridge firmware which unfortunately not all adapters do.\n\npyzwave could be adapted to talk directly with a non bridge controller but due to a signed NDA the source for this cannot be open sourced by **[Telldus Technologies AB](https://telldus.com)** (the author behind this library).\n\n## Status\n\n**[Z/IP Gateway](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/z-wave/controller-sdk/z-ip-gateway-sdk)** requires the connection between this library to be encrypted using DTLS. This library includes a connection using DTLS but unfortunately unsolicited reports does not yet work using this.\n\nA workaround until this issue is resolved is to recompile Z/IP gateway to not use DTLS for the connection.

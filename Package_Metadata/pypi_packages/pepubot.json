Bot is shortened from Robot, as you may know. ;-)\n\nThe Rules\n---------\n\n* PePu is arranged in rounds, usually a round is arranged on every\n  Friday, but it's also possible to arrange a round on any other day\n  or to skip rounds.\n\n* When a PePu round is running in a channel anyone in the channel can\n  attend and get a new ticket to the lottery box by posting a funny\n  picture or video to the channel.\n\n* Each attendee may get at most one new ticket to the lottery box per a\n  PePu round.  If the same person posts several pictures or videos to\n  the PePu channel, only the first one is awarded with a ticket.\n\n* When the round is ended, the winner will be selected by randomly\n  picking one of the tickets from the lottery box.  Then all tickets of\n  the winner will be removed from the lottery box and the rest of the\n  tickets will be stored for the next PePu round.  I.e. your chances to\n  win increase on every round until you win.\n\n* Anyone can arrange a PePu round, but the person who starts the round\n  should also arrange the prize bottle.\n\n* The person who starts the round also decides when the round ends and\n  is responsible to do so before the day ends.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nTo run PePuBot you need Python 3.7 and a Slack account.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\n1. Add a new app to Slack in https://api.slack.com/apps and add a bot\n   for that app.\n\n2. Enable the following permissions for the app:\n\n   * bot\n\n     - To act as a bot user in Slack\n\n   * chat:write:bot\n\n     - For writing to the channel\n\n   * reactions:write\n\n     - For marking ticket additions with reactions to the picture or\n       video message.\n\n   * users:read\n\n     - For filling user names to the tickets\n\n3. Install PePuBot and its dependencies to a Python virtual environment\n   or to a Docker container or using whatever isolation you prefer.  You\n   may do this with a command like::\n\n     pip install .\n\n4. Copy the \"Bot User OAuth Access Token\" value to environment variable\n   named ``SLACK_API_TOKEN`` or to a line in a configuration file named\n   ``pepubot.conf``.  There is a ``pepubot.conf.template`` which you can\n   use as a base.\n\n   - Note: Each configuration option can be set in the configuration\n     file or with an environment variable with the same name.  If a\n     variable is defined in both places, the value will be read from the\n     environment.\n\n5. Start the PePuBot with the script installed by Pip::\n\n     pepubot\n\n   By default the configuration file will be read from the current\n   working directory by name ``pepubot.conf``, but alternative location\n   can be given via command line argument::\n\n     pepubot --config-file /path/to/pepubot.conf\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/x-rst", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/andersinno/pepubot/", "keywords": "pepu,bot,Friday,bottle,lottery,Slack", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "Anders Innovations", "maintainer_email": "support@anders.fi", "name": "pepubot", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pepubot/", "platform": "any", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pepubot/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/andersinno/pepubot/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pepubot/0.1.0/", "requires_dist": ["aiofiles", "python-dateutil", "pytz", "slackclient[optional]"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Friday Bottle Lottery Bot for Slack", "version": "0.1.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>PePuBot is a Slack bot that can arrange Friday bottle lotteries on a\nSlack channel with a specific set of rules.</p>\n<div id=\"the-name\">\n<h2>The Name</h2>\n<p>PePu comes from Finnish words \u201cPerjantai Pullo\u201d, which means \u201cFriday\nBottle\u201d.

Component source code. Can be downloaded using `git clone git://git.openstack.org/openstack/<component_name>.git`.\n\nNote: `octario` is not provisioning the node on which it will run the tests. It's assumed\n      that the tester node is provided by the user by specifying it in the hosts file.\n\n## Run Octario\n\nFirst, create an inventory file that will include the IP address or the hostname of your tester node.\n\n```\nvi hosts\n\n[tester]\nmy_tester_host ansible_user=cloud-user\n```\n\nEdit `octario.yml` with your component details. Make sure to specify name and version!\n\n```\ncomponent:\n  name: nova\n  version: 9\n```\n\nRun octario!. Choose one of testers and run the following command in octario root directory\n\n```\nansible-playbook -vvv -i hosts playbooks/pep8.yml --extra-vars @octario.yml\n```\n\npep8.yml can be replaced with [unittest, functional, api, scenario].yml\n\n### Custom tester\n\nYou can specify your own tester\n\n```\nexport TESTER=my_new_cool_tester\nansible-playbook -vvv -i hosts playbooks/custom-tester.yml --extra-vars @octario.yml\n```\n\n### External ROLES\n\nYou can use external role with `octario`.\n\n```\ncp -r new_role octario/roles\nexport ROLE=new_role\nansible-playbook -vvv -i hosts playbooks/custom-role.yml --extra-vars @octario.yml\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe following drawing added to simplify work-flow overview of `octario` for simple testers\nas pep8, unittest and functional.\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"./doc/octario_workflow.png\" alt=\"Octario work-flow\"></div><hr />\n\n### Patch RPMs\n\nThe following drawing describes specifically how RPM patching done with Octario.\n\nTo inclue patch_rpm role, run playbooks/<tester>-with-patching.yml\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"./doc/patch_rpm.png\" alt=\"Octario patch rpm work-flow\"></div><hr />\n\n## More Docs\n\nSee the [/doc](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/octario/tree/master/doc) directory of this repo.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "UNKNOWN", "keywords": null, "license": "Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

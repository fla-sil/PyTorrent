The methodology can build upon the Clean\nCoalition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work conducting similar Solar Siting Surveys for other entities. The project will identify lower cost and\nhigher value renewable resource opportunities reflecting characteristics of all available sites in relation to existing\nloads and electric grid infrastructure. Outcomes will guide the development of cost-effective local solar generation\nwithin Anchorage.\n\n## Provided Materials\n1. EBCE case study (.kml)\n2. EBCE project summary (.xlsx)\n3. LIDAR data collected in 2015 (.las)\n4. Buildings Polygon (.shp)\n5. Address Point (.shp)\n6. Arcgis license offered by instructor\n\n## Plan\n1. Select an area for case study, details are shown in the \"Case Study\" section\n2. Rasterize the region and obtain information via different tools on ArcMap\n3. Case study has to be comprehensive enough so the exported models and their corresponding python scripts can process\ndata from other similar regions. For example, model created in this project can also be used in San Francisco or other\nregions with different latitude and longitude.\n\n## Case Study\nThe case region, where buildings, some parking lots and empty grounds exist in a well sorted pattern, was selected.\nThe selected las file name is 1659_2614.las. LAS file contains raw LIDAR point cloud data including x, y and z values.\nBy creating a new \"LAS Dataset\" it is possible to load the data into Arcmap. Creating masks that could trim unnecessary\nand unwanted data points. Aspect, slope, solar radiation and human sorting are five masks necessary to create. After\nmasking out the useful area irradiation raster, zonal statistics are calculated based on buildings' polygons. Then the\nmean value (if selected) of solar irradiation is presented on each building polygon provided. The table generated by\nzonal statistics feature can be used for data processing. Also, since masks are account for slopes that are larger than\n35 degrees, and aspect that does not face south, most of pipeline system, HVAC, ventilation and attics on the building\nwill not be included in the masked solar irradiation raster, thus the mean value calculated is relatively accurate. The\nshape file eventually converts into .kml file, which can display in Google Earth Pro and Google Map.\n\n## Tips\n1. This program is based on LIDAR data and corresponding building polygons extraction \n2. Python script generated by the model can process similar situations elsewhere\n3.

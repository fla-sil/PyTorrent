Open the menu Connectors > Jira > Backends\n2. Create a new Jira Backend\n\n   * Put the name you want\n   * Set the URL of your Jira, like https://jira.example.com\n   * You can also select the company where records will be created and the\n     default project template used when Odoo will create the projects in Jira\n\n3. Save and continue with the Authentication\n\nAuthentication of Backend\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n1. On the created backend, click on the Authenticate button, a popup with keys\n   will appear, keep these open in a tab\n2. Open Jira and go to System > Applications > Application links\n3. Enter the name of the application, example: odoo, and click on \"Create new link\"\n4. In the popup, set the URL where JIRA can reach Odoo. Jira might complain and\n   reopen the popup, confirm it again and a new popup appears\n5. In the new popup, do not set anything in the fields and click on Continue\n6. The link should be created now, edit it with the pen on the right\n7. Open the Incoming Authentication panel, be warned that it may take some time\n   to load\n8. Copy-paste the consumer key and public key from Odoo to the Jira link's\n   Incoming Authentication. Set a consumer name (e.g. odoo) and leave the\n   consumer callback url and 2 legged auth blank.\n9. Click on save at the bottom of the form (you need to scroll)\n10. Back on Odoo, click on Continue\n11. A link is displayed, click on it - you may need to login again - and click\n    on \"Allow\".\n12. Back on Odoo again, click on Continue\n13. Authentication is complete!\n\n\nConfiguration of the Backend\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nSetup the webhooks\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nIt is advised to setup the webhooks so the synchronizations are in realtime.\n\n1. On the Jira Backend, set the \"Base Odoo URL for Webhooks\" to URL of Odoo,\n   it must be reachable from Jira.\n2. Click on \"Install Webhooks\"\n\nConfigure the Epic Link\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nIf you use Epics, you need to click on \"Configure Epic Link\", Odoo will search\nthe name of the custom field used for the Epic Link.\n\nConfiguration done\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nYou can now click on the button \"Configuration Done\".\n\nSynchronizations\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe tasks and worklogs are always imported from JIRA to Odoo, there\nis no synchronization in the other direction.\n\nInitial synchronizations\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nYou can already select the \"Imports\" tab in the Backend and click on \"Link\nusers\" and \"Import issue types\". The users will be matched either by login or by email.\n\nCreate and export a project\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nProjects can be created in Odoo and exported to Jira. You can then create a\nproject, and use the action \"Link with JIRA\" and use the \"Export to JIRA\" action.\n\nWhen you choose to export a project to JIRA, if you change the name\nor the key of the project, the new values will be pushed to JIRA.\n\nLink a project with JIRA\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nIf you already have a project on JIRA or prefer to create it first on JIRA,\nyou can link an Odoo project. Use the \"Link with JIRA\" action on the project\nand select the \"Link with JIRA\" action.\n\nThis action establish the link, then changes of the name or the key on either\nside are not pushed.\n\nIssue Types on Projects\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nWhen you link a project, you have to select which issue types are synchronized.\nOnly tasks of the selected types will be created in Odoo.\n\nIf a JIRA worklog is added to a type of issue that is not synchronized,\nwill attach to the closest task following these rules:\n\n* if a subtask, find the parent task\n* if no parent task, find the epic task (only if it is on the same project)\n* if no epic, attach to the project without being linked to a task\n\nChange synchronization configuration on a project\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nIf you want to change the configuration of a project, such as which\nissue types are synchronized, you can open the \"Connector\" tab in\nthe project settings and edit the \"binding\" with the backend.\n\nSynchronize tasks and worklogs\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nIf the webhooks are active, as soon as they are created in Jira they should appear in Odoo.\nIf they are not active, you can open the Jira Backend and run the\nsynchronizations manually, or activate the Scheduled Actions to run the batch\nimports. It is important to select the issue types so don't miss this step (need improvement).\n\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\n* If an odoo user has no linked employee, worklogs will still be imported but\n  with no employee\n\n\nDesign Notes\n------------\n\nAllowing several bindings per project\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe design evolved to allow more than one Jira binding per project in Odoo.\nThis conveniently allows to fetch tasks and worklogs for many projects in Jira,\nwhich will be tracked in only one project in Odoo.\n\nIn order to push data to Jira, we have to apply restrictions on these\n\"multi-bindings\" projects, as we cannot know to which binding data must\nbe pushed:\n\n* Not more than one project (can be zero) can have a \"Sync Action\" set to\n  \"Export to JIRA\". As this configuration pushes the name and key of the project\n  to Jira, we cannot push it to more than one project.\n* If we implement push of tasks to Jira, we'll have to add a way to restrict or\n  choose to which project we push the task, this is not supported yet (for\n  instance, add a Boolean \"export tasks\" on the project binding, or explicitly\n  select the target binding on the task)\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/camptocamp/connector-jira", "keywords": "", "license": "AGPL-3", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "odoo11-addon-connector-jira", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/odoo11-addon-connector-jira/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/odoo11-addon-connector-jira/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/camptocamp/connector-jira"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/odoo11-addon-connector-jira/11.0.1.4.1/", "requires_dist": ["cryptography", "jira", "oauthlib", "odoo11-addon-connector", "odoo11-addon-multi-step-wizard", "odoo11-addon-queue-job", "odoo11-addon-web-widget-url-advanced", "odoo (<11.1dev,>=11.0a)", "requests"], "requires_python": ">=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*, !=3.4.*", "summary": "JIRA Connector", "version": "11.0.1.4.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"dependencies\">\n<h2>Dependencies</h2>\n<p>You need the following Python packages</p>\n<ul>\n<li>requests</li>\n<li>jira</li>\n<li>oauthlib</li>\n<li>requests-oauthlib</li>\n<li>requests-toolbelt</li>\n<li>PyJWT</li>\n<li>cryptography</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"setup\">\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<p>Once the addon is installed, follow these steps:</p>\n<div id=\"backend\">\n<h3>Backend</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the menu Connectors &gt; Jira &gt; Backends</li>\n<li>Create a new Jira Backend<ul>\n<li>Put the name you want</li>\n<li>Set the URL of your Jira, like <a href=\"https://jira.example.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jira.example.com</a></li>\n<li>You can also select the company where records will be created and the\ndefault project template used when Odoo will create the projects in Jira</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Save and continue with the Authentication</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div id=\"authentication-of-backend\">\n<h3>Authentication of Backend</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>On the created backend, click on the Authenticate button, a popup with keys\nwill appear, keep these open in a tab</li>\n<li>Open Jira and go to System &gt; Applications &gt; Application links</li>\n<li>Enter the name of the application, example: odoo, and click on \u201cCreate new link\u201d</li>\n<li>In the popup, set the URL where JIRA can reach Odoo.

Fantasy Bot\n==================\n\nA bot that can act as a manager in a Yahoo! fantasy league\n\nA$re you in a Yahoo! fantasy league with inactive managers?  Do you face teams that start players on the IR, and have been for weeks?  Or do you need a few more teams in your league?  This program helps eleviate that pain by intelligently managing a Yahoo! fantasy team.  It can optimize the lineup, taken into consideration available players in the free agent pool.  Adjust the IR and bench spots to account for star players that are a little banged up.  Approve or reject trades that are made to the team.  It does all of this by talking directly to Yahoo! without having to enter the transactions manually.  You just run the program whenever you need to set up the lineup, which takes only a few minutes to run.\n\nBuild status\n------------\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.com/spilchen/yahoo_fantasy_bot.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.com/spilchen/yahoo_fantasy_bot\n\nRestrictions\n------------\nThis program will only optimize lineups for teams in a Yahoo! Head-to-Head league.  It only works for teams in mlb or nhl leagues.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou first neet to setup the environment by installing the app.  You can pull the latest from github\n\n::\n\n  git clone https://github.com/spilchen/yahoo_fantasy_bot.git\n  cd yahoo_fantasy_bot\n  virtualenv --python=python3.7 env\n  source env/bin/activate\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nOr you can simply install the package from pip.\n\n::\n\n  pip install yahoo-fantasy-bot\n\n\nOnce the app is installed you need to setup the config file.  The config file is what you pass to the bot.  It includes details about what Yahoo! league you are going to run the bot against, the location of the file that holds the OAuth credentials, what league type it is.  There is a setup wizard that you can run that will get you a working config file for your league.\n\nBefore you can run the setup wizard you will first need to request an API key from Yahoo! from: https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/create.   The process is quick.  You will want to request read and write access, since we need write access to make changes to your roster.  Upon completion you will be given a consumer key and a consumer secret that you use with the setup wizard.\n\nWith key and secret, run the wizard like this:\n\n::\n\n  ybot_setup -k <consumer key> -s <consumer secret> oauth2.json my.cfg\n\n`oauth2.json` is used to store the credentials to access the team.  Using the key and secret, it will pop up a webpage that will confirm you want to grant access to the application.  It will give you a code, which you then paste back into the window running the setup wizard.  The bearer token that it generates is then saved in `oauth2.json` for all subsequent access.\n\nFollow the rest of the prompts in the setup wizard.  Upon completion it will write out a config file -- `my.cfg` in the example above.\n\nExecution\n---------\n\nOnce installed and the config file created, you can run the program via this command:\n\n::\n\n  ybot <cfg_file>\n\nThe default is to run in automated mode.  This will optimize the lineup for the next scoring period.  You can do this in a dry-run meaning no changes are made with Yahoo by specifying the --dry-run option.  There is also an interactive mode where you get a menu system and you can run the various lineup optimization commands with the --interactive option.\n\nTo get a full help text use the `--help` option.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere is a sample run through.  In this run it will optimize the lineup, print out the lineup then list the roster changes.  It will manage two players on the IR and replace one player in the lineup from the free agent pool.\n\n::\n\n  $> ybot hockey.cfg\n  Evaluating trades\n  Adjusting lineup for player status\n  Optimizing open lineup spots using available free agents\n  100%|################################################################################################################|\n  Optimizing lineup using players available from bench\n  100%|################################################################################################################|\n  Optimized lineup\n  B   :                        WK_G G/A/PPP/SOG/PIM\n  C   : Aleksander Barkov         3 38.0/63.0/32.0/241.0/10.0\n  C   : Brayden Point             3 38.0/55.0/38.0/223.0/26.0\n  LW  : Andrei Svechnikov         3 30.0/25.0/12.0/261.0/72.0\n  LW  : Evander Kane              4 31.0/26.0/12.0/279.0/132.0\n  RW  : David Pastrnak            3 44.0/53.0/39.0/281.0/40.0\n  RW  : Alexander Radulov         3 28.0/45.0/24.0/212.0/64.0\n  D   : Tyson Barrie              3 13.0/44.0/24.0/191.0/30.0\n  D   : Thomas Chabot             3 15.0/43.0/15.0/197.0/36.0\n  D   : P.K.

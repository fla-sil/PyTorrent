As a result, you get a per-host generated output of each\ncommand you specified.\n\nYou simply specify a plain text file with a list of remote hosts to connect to (domain names\nor IP addresses), and a comma-separated list of commands to execute on those. Note that\naccess credentials (user and password) must be the same for all the target hosts!.\n\n## Requirements\nMake sure your system meets the following requirements:\n* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (>= 3.4)\n* [paramiko](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko) (tested with v2.6.0)\n\n## Installation\nThe recommended method for installing this tool, is using `pip`:\n```\npip install ssh-commander\n```\n\n## Usage\nWhen using `ssh-commander`, respect the following syntax:\n```\nExecute remote commands on several hosts, with SSH.\nusage: ssh-commander [-h] [-p PORT] [-v] FILE USER COMMANDS\n\nExcecute remote commands on several hosts, with SSH.\n\npositional arguments:\n  FILE                  Plain text file with list of hosts\n  USER                  User to login on remote hosts\n  COMMANDS              Comma separated commands to be executed on remote\n                        hosts\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -p PORT, --port PORT  Specify SSH port to connect to hosts\n  -v, --version         Show current version\n```\nFirst, remember to create a text file (name it whatever you like), where you\nlist the target hosts. Its content, may look like this:\n```\n# This is a comment. It'll be ignored!.\n192.168.0.10\n192.168.0.11\n192.168.0.12\n```\nAlso, note that the password for the user provided, is gonna be asked only\nonce. Therefore, those credentials, should be valid on all target hosts!.\n\n### Examples\nLet's say you have some managed switches (or routers): \n```\nssh-commander hosts.txt root \"terminal length 0, sh port-security\"\n```\nThey could rather be some GNU/Linux servers, as well:\n```\nssh-commander hosts.txt foones \"hostname, whoami\"\n```\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/tuxedoar/ssh-commander", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "ssh-commander", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ssh-commander/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ssh-commander/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/tuxedoar/ssh-commander"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ssh-commander/0.1/", "requires_dist": ["paramiko"], "requires_python": ">=3.4", "summary": "Excecute remote commands on several hosts, with SSH", "version": "0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>SSH Commander</h1>\n<p>This command line tool, allows you to execute various commands on several remote hosts,\nusing the SSH protocol.

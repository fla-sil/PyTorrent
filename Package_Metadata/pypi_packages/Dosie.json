This is to help users establish what we call a \"**Network Of Trust**\"|\n|Find Information| **Dosie works automatically** to find, sort and categorize information. Unlike using regular search engines and a browser, and taking time to try out different search results, the app **simply does the proof-reading and verification of information** for users. The search algorithms are such that click-bait content can be vetted based on how much quality content is actually found. These results are automatically pushed down. There are configurations available for you to set limits and relevance grading for information found.|\n|You Get Only What You Want| Sometimes you may be only looking for a specific and small information, instead of a 2000 word blog post. Dosie squashes all that and **gives you just the couple lines of text or image information** you want. In the occasion where you may actually be interested in reading the 2000 word post, You will be **provided a link to the main content itself**.|\n\n##\n##\n##\n\n|**What Dosie Doesn't Do**|  |\n|--|--|\n|Keep Your Personal Information| The app currently doesn't require any information from it's users. No email, password, credit card information or any such data. All you need to do is install the app and use it. The app may have a log in system in future and may require an email-pasword login.|\n|Track Your Behavior| The app doesn't and will never pin your usage patterns and information searches to you to sell your data or show ads. We have no business or technological reasons to collect or keep such information. What the app may collect is performance data and bug reports to make sure we always know what our users want, and make useful updates.

The `SciPy instructions <https://scipy.org/install.html>`_ for installing related packages is a good guide for how to install a scientific Python environment. A good choice is the `Anaconda Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_, since, along with many other packages that are useful for scientific computing, it comes packaged with pyhdfe's only required dependencies: `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ and `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_.\n\nYou can install the current release of pyhdfe with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_::\n\n    pip install pyhdfe\n\nYou can upgrade to a newer release with the ``--upgrade`` flag::\n\n    pip install --upgrade pyhdfe\n\nIf you lack permissions, you can install pyhdfe in your user directory with the ``--user`` flag::\n\n    pip install --user pyhdfe\n\nAlternatively, you can download a wheel or source archive from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pyhdfe/>`_.

Palmero has already been tuned to offer high levels of security, and allows for customizablity with some parameters.\n\n### Uses Pycryptodome under the hood\nMost of the fundementals of the encryption process are handled by Pycryptodome, which allows for many levels of customisability and fine tuning in the source code. \n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/SimLoads/palmero", "keywords": "encryption decryption security tool", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "palmero", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/palmero/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/palmero/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/SimLoads/palmero"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/palmero/0.2.3/", "requires_dist": ["pycryptodome"], "requires_python": ">=3.4", "summary": "Easy and secure python encryption", "version": "0.2.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p># Palmero\nPalmero is a hyper-simplification of encryption in Python.</p>\n<p>## Features</p>\n<p>### Palmero features encryption key generation based on the identitiy of the machine you\u2019re encrypting on.\nMeaning that unless you know the password and are on the machine the file was created on, the file won\u2019t be unlocked.

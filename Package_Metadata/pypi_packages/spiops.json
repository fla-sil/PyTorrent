Please visit the NAIF \n        website  for more details about SPICE.\n         \n        \n        Introduction\n        ------------\n        \n        spiops is a python library thar uses [SpiceyPy](https://github.com/AndrewAnnex/SpiceyPy) to use [SPICE Toolkit](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/>) APIS to provide higher-level functions than the ones available \n        with SPICE. This functions have been idenfitied from having to implement \n        multiple time a series of SPICE APIs to obtain a given derived functionality.\n        \n        Functionalities vary from the computation of the illumination of a given \n        Field-of-View to obtaining the coverage of a given S/C for a particular \n        meta-kernel.\n        \n        The underlying idea of spiops is to be used as a multi-user and \n        multi-disciplinary pool of re-usable SPICE based functions to provide cross \n        mission and discipline support of SPICE for ESA Planetary and Heliophyiscs \n        missions. \n        \n        spiops is developed and maintained by the [ESA SPICE Service (ESS)](https://spice.esac.esa.int).\n        \n        \n        Installation\n        ------------\n        \n        First install the dependencies (spiceypy, pytest) for the project. Then\n        run ``pip install spiops`` to install from pypi.\n        \n        If you wish to install spiceypy from source first download or clone the project. Then run ``python setup.py install``.\n        To uninstall run ``pip uninstall spiceypy``.\n        \n        Documentation\n        -------------\n        \n        The spiops docs are available [here](ftp://spiftp.esac.esa.int/spiops/html/index.html).\n        The documentation for spiops is intentionally abridged so as to utilize the \n        excellent [documentation provided by the\n        NAIF](http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/index.html).\n        Please refer to C and IDL documentation available on the NAIF website\n        for in-depth explanations. Most of the functions docstrings have a \n        link to the\n        corresponding C function in the NAIF docs that the function is based on.\n        \n        How to Help\n        -----------\n        \n        Feedback and new functionalities are always welcome, if you discover that a \n        function is not \n        working as expected or if you have a function that you believe can be of \n        interest to other people please open an issue or contact [me](marc.costa@esa.int).\n        \n        Citing spiops\n        --------------\n        \n        If the use of spiops is used in a publication, please consider\n        citing spiops, SpiceyPy and the SPICE toolkit.

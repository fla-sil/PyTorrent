It encrypts the password database file using strong AES-256 encryption.\n\npwman has support for the following things:\n\n* Store arbitrary attributes and text data along with the passwords and login credentials.\n* Generate two factor authentication tokens (`TOTP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm>`_).\n* Database search with Regular Expressions or SQL LIKE syntax.\n* Database compare (diff). In pwman prompt, at pwman command line and as `git diff` extension.\n* Shell-style Tab-completion for all commands.\n* Custom Python scripts for arbitrary database processing.\n* Export of the complete database as SQL text dump, CSV dump and human readable plain text dump.\n\nInstall pwman\n=============\n\npwman does not have to be installed.

Pipelines are stored in `yaml` format.  Common tasks are to drop irrelevant messages, extract valuable data and sending the message somewhere.\n\n**Steps** are part of pipelines. They typically contain a `match` action to apply the task only to specific messages. Tasks can contain multiple actions.\n\n**Actions** are part of steps. Actions include `match`, `set` and `statsd`.

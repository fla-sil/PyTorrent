It is intended\nto compliment the slower more cautious approach of scikit-learn with regard to adding new predictors and modules, with a \nseparate pip-installable source for sklearn-compatible modules that may not meet those standards. \n\nIn particular, this project is interested in smaller one-off projects, particularly even gists, rather than larger more \nestablished ones (such as pylearn2, lifeline, or lightning). Other than larger projects, we will shy away from projects \nwith significant external dependencies (i.e. wrappers around vowpal wabbit or xgboost), and rather prefer more \npython/numpy/scipy based projects. \n\nDue to these guiding goals, the modules included here may not be as well tested, production ready, or stable as those included \ndirectly in sklearn.

A major benefit of\nthis package is that we will aim to consolidate requirements among the disparate projects, therefore, for the sake of \nmanagement, the code for the projects will be replicated here. In the spirit of OSS, we will also aim to contribute any\nmeaningful changes back to the original projects as well.\n\nA complete addition of a new package has a few components:\n\n * Actual addition of package into sklearn\\_extensions directory\n * Documentation of the included transformers/predictors in the sklearn\\_extensions docs\n * An example or two (included in the aforementioned docs as well) in the examples directory\n * A test or two, more if the source package has poor testing coverage\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nIn most cases, all that sklearn\\_extensions does with external projects is include them. All of the projects will remain\nsegregated into their own subdirectory, and will carry their original licenses in those subdirectories.\n\nAll material specific to this project (specifically any docs, tests, examples or original code) is released under the \nBSD 3-clause license.

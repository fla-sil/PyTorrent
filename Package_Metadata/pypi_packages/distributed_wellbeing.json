These metrics\ncan include measures of psychological and financial wellbeing. For the\nformer, a simple measure could be sentiment analysis of social media\nexpressions; for the latter, a simple measure could be somewhat similar\nto measurements of benefits needs.

There is distributed currency in the form of Bitcoin, there is\ndistributed communications in the form of Tox, there is distributed data\nin the form of BitTorrent and there is distributed information and\ninteraction in the form of Tor and onion routing. Analysis of\nindividuals and wellbeing can be distributed in a decentralized way.\n\nevolution of government\n-----------------------\n\nRevolution is hard and often unsuccessful. Evolution is easier and is\nmore amenable to change and optimisation. Consider distributed wellbeing\nas the possible beginnings of an automated system of government that can\nrun (to varying extents) concurrently with existing government and other\ndistributed wellbeing systems.\n\nproject goals\n-------------\n\nA goal of this project is to collate thoughts and methods of describing\nindividuals in terms of wellbeing needs, with two possible metrics being\npsychological wellbeing and financial wellbeing. Another goal of this\nproject is to create free, open software that is decentralized and\ncapable of analysis of individuals and automated flagging and\nprioritisation of psychological wellbeing needs and automated receipt of\nand distribution of wealth.\n\nsetup\n=====\n\n-  https://github.com/wdbm/abstraction\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    sudo pip install distributed_wellbeing\n    git clone https://github.com/wdbm/distributed_wellbeing.git\n    cd distributed_wellbeing\n\nusage\n=====\n\nsentiment analysis of tweets\n----------------------------\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    ./sentiment_tweets.py --help\n    ./sentiment_tweets.py\n\ndistributed wellbeing prototype\n-------------------------------\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    ./distributed_wellbeing.py --verbose\n\ndecentralization\n================\n\nIn peer-to-peer decentralization, push technologies like UDP broadcasts\ncan be used, whereby each client sends a heartbeat packet every so often\non the network for others to receive. The module socket is useful for\nthis.\n\nBitcoin clients use several methods to locate other clients. A primary\nmethod is to use a list of nodes from a previous connection to the\nnetwork. This works well generally for all connections except for the\nfirst connection and a connection that follows a long time of\ndisconnection. With no local list of nodes, DNS seeds, maintained hosts,\ncan be queried. A hardcoded list of nodes can be considered also. An old\nmethod was to use an IRC server that worked in a way similar to that of\nBitTorrent trackers.\n\n.. figure:: images/Simon_Stalenhag_by_procession_1920.jpg\n   :alt:", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/wdbm/distributed_wellbeing", "keywords": null, "license": "GPLv3", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "distributed_wellbeing", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/distributed_wellbeing/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/distributed_wellbeing/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/wdbm/distributed_wellbeing"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/distributed_wellbeing/2017.1.16.1617/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "prototype decentralised wellbeing analysis and distribution system", "version": "2017.1.16.1617", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"distributed-wellbeing\">\n<h2>distributed wellbeing</h2>\n<div>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/9d7bff11757a6cf4528dd79b7c6e822d8025ddeb/696d616765732f45696e737465696e2e706e67\">\n</div>\n<p><em>It can\u2019t be bargained with; it can\u2019t be reasoned with; it doesn\u2019t feel\npity, or remorse, or fear, and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until\nwellbeing is distributed.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"introduction\">\n<h2>introduction</h2>\n<div id=\"id1\">\n<h3>distributed wellbeing</h3>\n<p>Imagine a mechanism of voting that does not involve placing a pictogram\non paper into a secure box for scrutiny by a single government.

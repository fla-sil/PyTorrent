Many of the most useful development tools require (or at least work a lot better) in low latency environments. Since you local file system is about as low latency as it gets there's really where you want to do your work.

Before you try to use it I would recommend getting a basic understanding of how git works.

Here are some places to get started:\n\n - Git Home http://git-scm.com/\n\n - Git Tutorial http://www.ralfebert.de/tutorials/git/\n\n - Understanding Git Conceptually http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~cduan/technical/git/\n\n\nOS X Dependencies\n=================\n\nSkip any steps that install software you already have.\n\n#. Install the Xcode and the command line tools.\n   https://duckduckgo.com/?q=OS+X+xcode+command+line+tools\n\n#. Install Homebrew\n   http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/\n\n#. Install git\n\n   ``brew install git``\n\n#. Install python\n\n   ``brew install python``\n\n#. Install terminal-notifier.\n\n   ``brew install terminal-notifier``\n\n#. Install pip\n\n   ``easy_install pip``\n\n#. Install GitSync\n\n   ``pip install GitSync``\n\n#. Manually install the latest version of pync. If you get errors complaining\n   about pync not being properly installed you should manually install the\n   latest version from here.\n   https://github.com/SeTeM/pync\n\n\nRemote Dependencies\n===================\n\nThe Remote system needs to be setup with the following things.\n\n#. SSH access.\n\n#. SSH Keys to allow authentication with having to put in passwords.\n\n#. Git needs to be installed.\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nThe assumption git sync makes (right now) is that the latest version of your stuff is on the remote system.\n\nOn the first sync it will assume the location on the local file system is empty and the first thing it needs to do is pull down the files from the remote system.\n\n#. Copy the example configuration file (examples/git_sync.yaml) giving it an appropriate name.\n\n#. Set all the values in the config file.\n   - local_path: This is the path on your local machine where you want your files to go.\n   - local_branch_name: The name of the git branch you want git sync to use.\n   - remote_host: The IP or domain name of the remote system you want to use.\n   - remote_user: Your username on the remote system\n   - remote_path: The path on the remote system with the files in it you want to sync with.\n   - git_ignore: A list of patterns you want git to ignore, in this context that means these are files that will not get synced.\n\nCurrent Git Users: Caution\n==========================\n\nIf you are already using git for version control, be careful. This has been take\ninto account (somewhat) but has not really been tested yet. In the future we\nwould like to fully support that.\n\n\nRunning git_sync.py\n===================\n\nIn Terminal run the following command::\n\n  git_sync path/to/your/config/file.yaml\n\nIt should do some setup work. This could take a lot time if this is the initial sync, if there are a lot of changes or if the network connection is slow.\n\nOnce it's done start working. Open files. Save files. Create files. Every time you do something that results in a file system event you should see a growl notification that git sync has started and shortly after another one that it is finished.\n\nOnce the sync in finished, check on the server, and the changes should have been synced.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n- [LICENSE](LICENSE) ([MIT License][MIT])\n\n[MIT]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT \"The MIT License (MIT)\"\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.1.2 (2014-07-18)\n-----------------------------------------\n\n* Better library packages system.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": null, "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/clockwork/GitSync", "keywords": null, "license": "MIT", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "GitSync", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/GitSync/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/GitSync/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/clockwork/GitSync"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/GitSync/0.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Use git to sync a project directory on an OS X client with a remote server.", "version": "0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>This tool allows a developer to work on files on their local machine and have their work synced on a remote system.

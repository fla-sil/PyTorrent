It's simple:\n\n1. Create an issue with bug you found or proposal you have. Wait for approve from maintainer.\n2. Create a pull request. Make sure all checks are green.\n3. Fix review comments if any.\n4. Be awesome.\n\nHere are useful tips:\n\n- You can run all checks and tests with `make check`. Please do it before TravisCI does.\n- We use [BestDoctor python styleguide](https://github.com/best-doctor/guides/blob/master/guides/python_styleguide.md).

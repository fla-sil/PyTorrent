Username is either the email address you use to log in to Ewelink, or your phone number with the country code in front.\n\n> **username** - The email address or phone number you signed up with on Ewelink. Preface phone number with the country code\n\n> **password** - Your password to Ewelink.\n\n> **api_region** - The API region you use, valid ones are apparently 'us', 'eu' and 'cn'\n\n> **user_apikey** - The API key of authenticated user, defaults to None\n\n> **bearer_token** - The Bearer token of authenticated user, defaults to None\n\n> **grace_period** - This defaults to 600, I don't know why yet.\n\n## Usage\nHere's a really simple example of how you can use this library. \n\n```\nimport sonoff\nimport config\n\ns = sonoff.Sonoff(config.username, config.password, config.api_region)\ndevices = s.get_devices()\nif devices:\n    # We found a device, lets turn something on\n    device_id = devices[0]['deviceid']\n    s.switch('on', device_id, None)\n\n# update config\nconfig.api_region = s.get_api_region\nconfig.user_apikey = s.get_user_apikey\nconfig.bearer_token = s.get_bearer_token\n```\n\n## Support\n\nI have tested in Python 2 and Python 3, however as we all know there may be some library weirdness.\n\nI mainly put this together for my own use, I have learned a little about how the Sonoff kit works but for support it might be better to look at the library Peter Buga put together. I'm happy to look at any issues though.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Ewelink registration for 4 channel switches\nThe Sonoff switches have one of the most non-intuitive installation processes I have encountered. For registering my 4 channel switch I had to:\n* Hold one of the buttons until it flashed quick, quick, slow.\n* Hold a second time until it rapidly flashed in a constant pattern. I did not see the ITEAD-xx access point until it rapidly flashed.\n* Once it is rapidly flashing, connect to the ITEAD-xx network.\n* Choose the Compatible Pairing Mode (AP) option, then press Next. (This looks like a help page, but it is actually a fourth option (and the one you want!!)).\n* Follow the onscreen instructions.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/lucien2k/sonoff-python", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "sonoff-python", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/sonoff-python/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/sonoff-python/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/lucien2k/sonoff-python"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/sonoff-python/0.2.1/", "requires_dist": ["requests (>=2.12.4)", "websocket-client (>=0.54.0)"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Make use of your sonoff smart switches without flashing them via the cloud APIs", "version": "0.2.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>sonoff-python</h1>\n<p>Make use of your sonoff smart switches without flashing them via the cloud APIs, this should work in Python 2 or Python 3.</p>\n<p>This project is heavily inspired (read: almost entirely borrowed) by the work that Peter Buga did on a Simple Home Assistant integration for Ewelink <a href=\"https://github.com/peterbuga/HASS-sonoff-ewelink\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/peterbuga/HASS-sonoff-ewelink</a></p>\n<p>I spent a day looking into various ways to work with Sonoff switches and drew a bit of a blank.

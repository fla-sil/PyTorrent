By heavily relying on the python scripting language,\n        SUMMON allows the user to rapidly prototype a custom visualization for\n        their data,  without the overhead of designing a graphical user\n        interface or recompiling  native code.  By simplifying the task of\n        designing a visualization, users can  spend more time on understanding\n        their data. \n\n        SUMMON is designed to be a fast interface for developing interactive\n        visualizations (via scene graphs) for OpenGL. Although python libraries\n        already exist for accessing OpenGL, python is relatively slow for\n        real-time interaction with large visualizations (trees with 100,000\n        leaves, sparse matrices with a million non-zeros, etc.). Therefore, with\n        SUMMON all real-time interaction is handled with compiled native C++\n        code (via extension module).

Yet\n        a  poor interface is very painful to work with. Even when one has a good\n        interface, rarely can it be automated for batch mode.  Instead, SUMMON\n        relies on the Python  prompt for most interaction.

F3D achieves\nplatform-portable parallelism on modern multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs. The interface and mechanisms to access F3D\naccelerated kernels are written in Python to be fully integrated with other Python packages. F3D delivers several key\nimage-processing algorithms necessary to remove artifacts from micro-tomography data. The algorithms consist of data\nparallel aware filters that can efficiently utilize resources and can process data out of core and scale efficiently\nacross multiple accelerators. Optimized for data parallel filters, F3D streams data out of core to efficiently manage\nresources, such as memory, over complex execution sequence of filters. This has greatly expedited several scientific\nworkflows dealing with high-resolution images. F3D preforms two main types of 3D image processing operations:\nnon-linear filtering, such as bilateral and median filtering, and morphological operators (MM) with varying 3D\nstructuring elements.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\npyF3D requires PyOpenCL_ to run.

The oldest snapshots will be deleted. \n                            Default: 3\n      --snapshot-only       Only snapshot EBS volumes, do not remove old snapshots\n      --remove-only         Only remove old snapshots, do not create new snapshots\n      --verbose, -v         enable verbose output (-vvv for more)\n      --version             display version number and exit\n      \n      \n\nExamples\n--------\n\nCreate snapshots of all EBS volumes in us-east-1:\n\n::\n\n    backup-monkey --region us-east-1\n\nDelete snapshots of EBS volumes in us-west-1 where a volume has more than 5 snapshots:\n\n::\n\n    backup-monkey --region us-west-1 --max-snapshots-per-volume 5 --remove-only\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install Backup Monkey using the usual PyPI channels. Example:\n\n::\n\n    sudo pip install backup_monkey\n    \nYou can find the package details here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/backup_monkey\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to install from source:\n\n::\n\n    git clone git@github.com:Answers4AWS/backup-monkey.git\n    cd backup-monkey\n    python setup.py install\n\n\nWarning\n-------\n\nMake no mistake. This script WILL delete snapshots. This script WILL create\nsnapshots, which can cost you money. There really are no warranties or\nguarantees.

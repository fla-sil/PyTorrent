We have implemented a standard Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) energy gradient estimator for this general case, which can be used to approximate the ground state of a quantum system according to a given Hamiltonian. The neural-network-based approach for representing wave-fucntions was shown to be a promising method for solving the many-body problem, often matching or even surpassing the precision of other competing methods.\n\nIn addition to an MCMC energy gradient estimator, we have also implemented our novel Neural Autoregressive Quantum State wave-function representation that supports efficient and exact sampling. By overcoming the reliance on MCMC, our models can converge much faster for models of same size, which allows us to scale them to millions of parameters, as opposed to just a few thousands for prior approaches. This leads to better precison and ability to invesitgate larger and more intricated systems.

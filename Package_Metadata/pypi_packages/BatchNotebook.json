Consequently, this library,\n`BatchNotebook <https://github.com/jbn/BatchNotebook>`_ is deprecated.\n\nPlease use: `runipy <https://github.com/paulgb/runipy/>`_ instead.\n\n\nWhy Use This Library\n--------------------\n\n1. Explore data by writing an series of IPython notebooks.\n2. The Data are updated. Rerun all notebooks.\n3. Use nbconvert to generate reports from the executed notebooks.\n\nThis library saves time on step 2. That is, it allows you to rerun your\nnotebooks from the command line, in batch mode, rather than running them\nmanually or hacking together some browser runner with Selenium or something\nsimilar. It assumes that your executed notebook(s) will be used as a reporting\ntool (e.g. you want the inline html graphs.) If you do not need to use the\nexecuted notebook as a report, this library is not necessary; there are other\nscripts that can extract the code and turn it into a plain old py script.\n\nAccording to `this stackoverflow post <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17905350/running-an-ipython-notebook-non-interactively>`_,\nnon-interactive IPython notebook execution will be added to the 2.0 core. Until\nthen, I patched together this library from the work of others.\n\nHow To Use This Library\n-----------------------\n\nThis library installs a script ``run_ipython_script.py``. The following is the\noutput of of ``run_ipython_script.py --help``::\n\n    usage: run_ipython_script.py [-h] [--timeout TIMEOUT] [--verbose] src dst\n\n    Run IPython notebook scripts in batch mode.\n\n    positional arguments:\n      src                   source notebook path\n      dst                   destination notebook path\n\n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      --timeout TIMEOUT, -T TIMEOUT\n                            max execution time in seconds per cell\n      --verbose, -V         print status messages as processing proceeds\n\n\nCaveats\n-------\n\nDon't use ``print``. I'm not an IPython developer so I can't explain why\nsomething does or does not work, but calls to print will break the output.\nInstead, do ``from IPython.display import HTML`` and return the HTML object\nin a cell where you want printed string output.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nIf you have any bug fixes or contributions, please send a pull request to the\n`BatchNotebook repository on github <https://github.com/jbn/BatchNotebook>`_.\nHowever, please keep in mind *this library is a temporary workaround to a\nproblem that is being addressed by those developers who know IPython best*.\nTherefore, you may want lend your typing hands to the next IPython 2.0 core,\nrather than me.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\nThis library was based off of:\n`minrk's script <https://gist.github.com/minrk/2620735>`_ and\n`davidshinn's script <https://gist.github.com/davidshinn/6110231/raw/bb7efbac56e8c007eb24f5dc057896b7a07db1bb/ipnbdoctest.py>`_.\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\nThis library was written to generate reports for a project funded by AFRL,\nmanaged by JHU/APL.

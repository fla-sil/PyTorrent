Run `pip install django-locator`.\n 2. In `settings.py` add `locator` to the `INSTALLED_APPS`.\n 3. In `urls.py` add `url(r'^locator/', include('locator.urls', namespace='locator'))` to the `urlpatterns`.\n 4. Run `manage.py syncdb`.\n\n\n## Using the template tag\n\ndjango-locator is easy to include in your templates, you just need to do two\nthings:\n\n 1. Include the CSS and JS files on the page you're wanting to use django-locator.\n 2. Load the django-locator template tag and insert it where you want it to show up.\n\n### Including the CSS and JS files\n\nThere is one CSS file, place this line in your HTML header with the rest of your\nCSS imports:\n\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}locator/css/map.css\" />\n\nThe JS is slightly more complex, first, make sure you don't already have jQuery,\nif you don't have jQuery then add this to the bottom of your HTML file but still\ninside your `<body></body>` tag:\n\n    <script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n\nOnce you have jQuery you now need the Google Maps API JS files:\n\n    <script src=\"//maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false\"></script>\n\nClose to the end! Now include the store locator JS file below both of these\nimports:\n\n    <script src=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}locator/js/jquery.storelocator.js\"></script>\n\nLastly we need to initialize the store locator script by putting this at the\nvery bottom below the imports we just made:\n\n    <script>\n        $(function() {\n            $('#map-container').storeLocator({\n                'jsonData': true,\n                'dataLocation': '{% url locator:locations %}',\n            });\n        });\n    </script>\n\n### Loading the template tag\n\nOnce you have the CSS and JS included the template tag is easy, add\n`{% load locator %}` to the top of your template and then put `{% locator %}`\nwhere you want the locator to show up on your page.\n\n\n## Customizing\n\nYou can of course override everything in my CSS file easily by importing your\nown CSS file below it or copying my CSS file, making changes to it and then\nimporting your changed CSS file instead of my own.\n\nAlong with the basic CSS customizing see [Bjorn's blog post][0] about how you can\nmodify our JavaScript initilizer to further customize your experience.\n\n\n## Notes\n\nI include an `initial_data.json` fixture to load in a few example items, you can\neasily mass delete them on the admin interface.\n\nTo access my \"test\" template you can append `/locator/` to your base URL. All of\nthe locations are pulled via JSON from the URL `/locator/locations/` if you want\nto use this data for anything else.\n\n\n## Credits\n\nGive all your thanks to [Bjorn][1] who created the [jQuery plugin][0] we make extensive\nuse of in this app.\n\n\n## License (Simplified BSD)\n\nCopyright (c) Isaac Bythewood  \nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

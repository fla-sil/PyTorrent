Barcode of Life Data system (BOLD) offers such a database that is used by many biologists. Unfortunately, only batches of 100 sequences can be identified once. Using BOLD's API does not solve the problem completely since it does not grant access to private and early release data. BOLDigger aims to solve this problem. As a pure python program with a user-friendly GUI, it not only gives automated access to the identification engine but can also be used to download additional metadata for each sequence as well as helping to choose the top hit from the returned results.\n\n## Installation\n\nBOLDigger requires Python version 3.6 or higher and can be easily installed by using pip in any commandline:  \n\n`pip install boldigger`  \n\nwill install BOLDigger as well as all needed dependencies.\nBOLDigger can be started by typing:  \n\n`boldigger` or `python -m boldigger`\n\nWhen a new version is released you can update by typing:\n\n`pip install --upgrade boldigger`\n\n## Login to your account\n\nThe identification engine requires an account at www.boldsystems.org. A login is required to query more than one sequence with the identification engine. Userdata can be saved by ticking \"Remember me\". **Note that your password will be saved unencrypted. Don't use this option if this is not okay.**  \nOnly one login per session is required.\n\n## Use the BOLD identification engine for COI, ITS and rbcL & matK\n\nOnce logged into the account, the identification engine of BOLD can be used. An output folder needs to be selected where the results will be saved, as well as an input file in .fasta format. Three different databases can be selected: **COI, ITS or rbcL & matK** as well as a **batch size**. The latter handles how many sequences will be identified in one request. 100 is the maximum value as and the default for COI. Batch size depends on various parameters such as internet connection, availability of the BOLD database as well as  length of the requested sequences and needs to be adjusted if a lot of ConnectionErrors occour. A batch size of **100 is recommended for COI**, **10 for ITS**, and **< 5 for rbcL & matK.**  \nThe results will be written to the output folder and will always be named \"BOLDResults_fastaname.xlsx\". In case a workbook with that name already exists in the output folder the results will be appended to this file.   \nAfter every batch, the requested sequences will be removed from the input file and written to a new file named \"fastaname_done.fasta\" in the same folder as the input file. This is to prevent running input files twice: If BOLDigger crashes it can just be restarted with the same output folder and input file and will continue  where the crash occurred.\n\n**The BOLD server will take some time to respond to the request. The output window will freeze during this time and updated once a response is sent.**\n\nTest input files can be found [here](https://github.com/DominikBuchner/BOLDigger/tree/master/tests)\n\n## Download additional data from BOLD\n\nThe standard output of the identification engine returns information about the taxonomy (Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species and Subspecies) as well as a similarity score for each hit in the database, if the data is public, private or early-access as well as the BOLD Process ID.  \nAdditional data can be downloaded via the BOLD API by providing the output of the identification the identification engine. Additional data are: BOLD Record ID, BOLD BIN, Sex, Life stage, Country, Identifier, Identification method, the institution storing the sample and a link to the specimen page. Note that in order to open the specimen page a login to boldsystems.org is required.\n\n## Find the best fitting hit from the top 20 (COI) and top 99 (ITS / rbcL & matK)\n\nThere are three options available to determine the best fitting hit:  \n* First hit\n* JAMP Pipeline\n* BOLDigger\n\n### First hit\n\nThis options uses the first hit and can be used for all markers supported by BOLDigger.\n\n### JAMP Pipeline\n\nThis option reproduces the output from the [JAMP Pipeline](https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP). Therefore different thresholds (98%: species level, 95%: genus level, 90%: family level, 85%: order level, <85%: class level) for the taxonomic levels are used to find the best fitting hit.  \nAfter determining the threshold for all hits the most common hit above the threshold will be selected. Note that for all hits below the threshold the taxonomic resolution will be adjusted accordingly (e.g. for a 96% hit the species level information will be discarded and genus level information will be used as the lowest taxonomic level).\n\n### BOLDigger - requires additional data\n\nThis option is similar to the JAMP option but flags suspicious hits. **Make sure additional data was downloaded.**\nThere are currently 4 flags implemented, which will be updated if needed:\n\n1. Reverse BIN taxonomy has been used for any of the top 20 hits representing the selected match. (Reverse BIN taxonomy: Deposited sequences on BOLD that lack species information may be assigned by BIN affiliation. By that, a species name is shwon for deposited sequences eben when no morphological identification down to species level was carried out.)\n\n2. There are two or more entries with differeing taxonomic information above the selected threshold. (e.g. two species above 98%). Note that this is sometimes the case due to deposited sequences bearing invalid epitheton information such as \"sp.\" or even a blank entry.\n\n3. All of the top 20 hits representing the top hit are private or early-release hits.\n\n4. The top hit result represents a unique hit of the top 20 hits.\n\nA closer look at all flagged hits is advised since they represent a certain degree of uncertainty for the selected hit.\n\n## Still to do\n\n* Implement the identification engine API for quick analyses\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/DominikBuchner/BOLDigger", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "boldigger", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/boldigger/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/boldigger/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/DominikBuchner/BOLDigger"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/boldigger/1.1.3/", "requires_dist": ["PySimpleGUI (>=4.18.2)", "requests-html (>=0.10.0)", "beautifulsoup4 (>=4.7.1)", "openpyxl (>=2.6.2)", "numpy (>=1.16.4)", "pandas (>=0.25.0)", "requests (>=2.22.0)", "more-itertools (>=7.2.0)", "lxml (>=4.3.3)", "html5lib (>=1.0.1)", "xlrd (>=1.2.0)"], "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "A python package to query different databases of boldsystems.org", "version": "1.1.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>BOLDigger</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/ae68712fbfe59bae894d84eabaf533df0a2e0657/626f6c6469676765722f646174612f6c6f676f2e706e67\"></p>\n<p>Python program to query .fasta files against the different databases of <a href=\"http://www.boldsystems.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.boldsystems.org</a></p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>DNA metabarcoding data sets often consist of hundreds of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), which need to be queried against databases to assign taxonomy.

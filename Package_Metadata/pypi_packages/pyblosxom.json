It was originally a Python\nclone of `Blosxom`_ but has since evolved into a blog system of its\nown reminiscent of `Blosxom`_.\n\n.. _Blosxom: http://www.blosxom.com/\n\nPyblosxom focuses on three things:\n\n**simplicity**\n\n  Pyblosxom stores all data on the file system in plain text files.\n  This allows you to use any text editor to create, update and\n  manipulate entries.  You can also use existing text-manipulation\n  tools, version control, scripts, grep, ...  for managing your blog.\n\n  Pyblosxom can run as a CGI script, WSGI component or you can use it\n  to statically compile your website into HTML/XML files.\n\n  Your workflow is your workflow.\n\n**extensibility**\n\n  Pyblosxom has a plugin framework enabling you to augment and enhance\n  Pyblosxom's default behavior.  Plugins are written in Python.  We\n  maintain a list of plugins in the plugin registry on the website.\n\n  Plugins aren't hard to write.  We're happy to help you write\n  plugins.\n\n**community**\n\n  There are several hundred Pyblosxom users out there all of whom have\n  different needs.  Pyblosxom is used on a variety of operating\n  systems in a variety of environments.  We have the standard open\n  source project fare: mailing lists, IRC channel, wiki, ...\n\nPyblosxom is built to let you use existing text-manipulation tools\nwithout having to build the whole ecology from scratch.\n\nPyblosxom can be run as:\n\n* a \"static renderer\" and compile your blog\n* a CGI script\n* a WSGI application\n\nYou can learn more about Pyblosxom on the `website`_.\n\n.. _website: http://pyblosxom.github.com/\n\n\nWhy you might not want to use Pyblosxom\n=======================================\n\nPyblosxom is a small open source project and while there is a\ncommunity, it's pretty small.  Pyblosxom's features are great but make\nit a niche blog system.\n\nPyblosxom is a *file-based* blog system.  Each blog entry is a\nseparate file stored in a directory hierarchy on your file system.  By\ndefault, the hierarchy is a category tree meaning each blog entry\nbelongs in a single category.  By default, mtimes are used as the blog\nentry timestamp.  There are plugins that change this behavior, but\nrequire extra configuration to use.\n\nThere are a lot of other blog systems out there.  If it's apparent\nthat Pyblosxom won't work for you, don't force it---use something\nelse.\n\n\nOverview of Pyblosxom\n=====================\n\nEntries, categories, storage:\n\n* Pyblosxom stores everything as files on the file system---there is\n  no database.\n* Each blog entry is a file.\n* Blog entry files are stored in a directory hierarchy in your *datadir*.\n* Each subdirectory in your *datadir* corresponds to a category of\n  your blog.\n\nThemes:\n\n* Themes in Pyblosxom are called *flavours*.\n* A flavour consists of a set of *templates*.\n* Flavours are stored in a directory called the *flavourdir*.\n* Pyblosxom comes with several flavours: html, rss20, and atom.\n* The `website <http://pyblosxom.github.com/>`_ maintains a flavour\n  registry for flavours contributed by people like you.\n* There's more information on flavours and templates in\n  the Flavours and Templates chapter of the manual\n  (``docs/flavours_and_templates.rst`` if you're looking at the source).\n\nPlugins:\n\n* Pyblosxom has a plugin system.\n* Plugins are written in Python.\n* Plugins are loaded using the ``plugin_dirs`` and ``load_plugins``\n  configuration variables.\n* The `website <http://pyblosxom.github.com/>`_ maintains a plugin\n  registry for plugins submitted by people like you.\n* For more information on using plugins, see Plugins in the manual\n  (``docs/plugins.rst`` if you're looking at the source).\n* For more information on writing plugins see Writing Plugins\n  (``docs/dev_writing_plugins.rst`` if you're looking at the source).\n\n\n.. _project-details-and-contact:\n\nProject details, contact information, and where to go for help\n==============================================================\n\nSee the `website <http://pyblosxom.github.com/>`_ for details on\nthe mailing lists, IRC, source code, issue tracker, and everything\nelse.\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n* Python 2.5 or higher---does not work with Python 3 or higher\n* (optional) Sphinx for building documentation\n* (optional) other things depending on what plugins you install\n\n\nHow to install Pyblosxom\n========================\n\nIf you're installing for the first time, be sure to read Installing\nPyblosxom in the manual (``INSTALL`` if you're looking at the source).\n\nIf you're upgrading from a previous Pyblosxom version, read Upgrading\nPyblosxom in the manual (``UPGRADE`` if you're looking at the source)\nas well as What's New in the manual (``WHATSNEW`` if you're looking at\nthe source) which covers what's new in this version and what you'll\nneed to change in your blog.\n\n\nHow to find comprehensive documentation\n=======================================\n\nThe source tarball comes with a ``docs/`` directory which contains the\nPyblosxom manual for that version of Pyblosxom.\n\nThe manual for the most current version and past versions of Pyblosxom\ncan be found on the `website <http://pyblosxom.github.com/>`_.\n\n\nHow to join the community\n=========================\n\nPyblosxom is written for and by people like you.  If you're using\nPyblosxom, please contribute something back whether it's reporting a\nbug, fixing something, adding a new flavour, blogging about Pyblosxom,\ntelling your friends, writing a plugin, or hanging out with us on IRC.\n\nDetails on where we hang out and such are on the `website\n<http://pyblosxom.github.com/>`_.\n\n\nHow to report bugs, send in patches, fix problems\n=================================================\n\nIf you have a problem with Pyblosxom, please report it!\n\nThere are several different ways to report a bug, but all bugs should\neventually make their way into our issue tracker.\n\n1. Let someone know on IRC: #pyblosxom on irc.freenode.net\n\n2. Send a mail to the pyblosxom-users or pyblosxom-devel mailing\n   lists.  Details are on the `website\n   <http://pyblosxom.github.com/>`_.\n\n3. Write up a bug report in the issue tracker.  Details are on the\n   `website <http://pyblosxom.github.com/>`_.\n\nIf you're able to fix the bug, that helps a ton!  Please attach a\npatch file to the bug report or send the patch as an attachment to the\npyblosxom-devel mailing list.\n\nWhen sending a patch, it helps a lot to know the details of the bug as\nwell as how you fixed it and whether there are outstanding issues.\n\n\nHow to run unit tests\n=====================\n\nTests are written with the Python unittest module and don't require\nany additional test frameworks.\n\nTo run the tests, do::\n\n    python setup.py test\n\nThis will build Pyblosxom, then run the tests.\n\nIf you would like to add tests to the test suite, please do and send\nus patches!", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://pyblosxom.github.com/", "keywords": "blog pyblosxom cgi weblog wsgi", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "pyblosxom", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyblosxom/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyblosxom/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://pyblosxom.github.com/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyblosxom/1.5.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Pyblosxom is a file-based weblog engine.", "version": "1.5.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"what-is-pyblosxom\">\n<h2>What is Pyblosxom</h2>\n<p>Pyblosxom is a lightweight blog system.

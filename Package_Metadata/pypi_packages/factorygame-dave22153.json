The\nframework is developed with the idea to enable rapid game development and\nprototyping, with a robust and extendable toolset.\n\n### Flexibility\n\nThe use of the Python scripting language throughout makes this engine highly\nflexible. It has an open source policy to support understanding and extending\nany part of the engine with ease. By letting users choose their workflow, it\nempowers them to use their existing techniques to speed up build times.\n\n### Development Operations\n\nThis game engine can cater to many experience levels. Python is already\nvastly popular and the number of users is growing. Nothing in the framework\nis preventing users from building a game as it's designed to be a streamlined\nhassle-free time. Previous users of Godot's scripting language will feel at\nhome.\n\n## Installation\n\nJust download it and start working straight away. It is recommended to have\nsome Python knowledge, although this is optional. First take a look at the\nincluded samples by executing `run_test.py`. This will showcase all the current\nincluded features.\n\n## Usage\n\nYou are free to use this engine as you wish. We would love to know if you have\nmade a game with it.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://gitlab.com/factorygame/factorygame", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "factorygame-dave22153", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/factorygame-dave22153/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/factorygame-dave22153/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://gitlab.com/factorygame/factorygame"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/factorygame-dave22153/0.2.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.2", "summary": "Python game engine to have a 2d movable \"graph\".", "version": "0.2.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>FactoryGame</h1>\n<p>Python game engine to have a 2d movable \"graph\".</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>Factorygame is a game engine meant for simple, minimalist games.

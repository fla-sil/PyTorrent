The scripts provided to backup each of the services are ... well ... they are what they are. Simple shell scripts; not much safety nets, poor logging / error reporting, may not follow best practices and may seem complete non-sense to experts. \n\nThere is a large `TODO list <https://github.com/devo-ps/backupallthethings#todo>`_, feel free to look into it and hack at will!\n\nInstall\n=======\n\n\nFrom pypi:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install backupallthethings\n\n\nLatest:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    \n    pip install git+https://github.com/devo-ps/backupallthethings\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nAll the configuration files are available in ``/opt/batt/conf``\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nHelp\n----\n\nProvide extensive help about all the supported options.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    \n    batt -h\n\n\nList supported services\n-----------------------\n\nList the scripts that are enabled when ran without parameters\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    \n    batt list \n\n\nAdd / Remove service to the defaults\n------------------------------------\n\nAdd / remove support for the services' backup scripts. Note that it only applies when ran without parameters.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    # Add support for the mysql / file and postgresql services\n    sudo batt enable mysql file postgresql\n    \n    # Disable (if enabled previously) the support for redis and mongodb\n    sudo batt disable redis mongodb\n\n\nThe logic is similar to Apache/Nginx ``sites-enabled``. ``batt`` creates links to the real script in ``/opt/batt/scripts-enabled`` and remove those links when disabling services.\n\nYou need to run the enable/disable feature as ``root`` due to the permissions.\n\nRun Backup\n----------\n\n**Run backup for the enabled services**\n\nWhen ran without parameters, ``batt`` will attempt to run every enabled backup script and use their respective configuration files.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    sudo batt\n\n\nYou need to run the backup as ``root``.\n\n**Run custom backup**\n\nWhen passing parameters to the ``batt`` command, it will effectively bypass the default enabled services and attempt to run each of the service provided on the command line.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    \n    # Will run the mysql and file backup scripts with the default values provided in\n    # the script and config file.\n    sudo batt mysql file\n    \n    # Will backup only the ``wordpress`` database and the ``/var/www/wordpress`` folder\n    sudo batt mysql file --mysql-db wordpress --file /var/www/wordpress\n    \n    # Same as above; the service ``mysql`` and ``file`` can be ommitted as they are \n    # implicitely defined by the \n    # `--mysql-db` and `--file` options\n    sudo batt --mysql-db wordpress --file /var/www/wordpress\n    \n    # You can specify options multiple times as well; it will backup both the \n    # wordpress and mysql databases (in different files)\n    sudo batt --mysql-db wordpress --mysql-db mysql\n\n\n**Custom destination folder**\n\nBy default the backup archives will be saved in ``/opt/backup/YYYY/MM/DD/{service}``. Beware that the former files will be overwritten if they already exist.\n\nYou can change the path of the destination folder to be more granular or fully custom with the ``--path`` argument.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    # Will put the backup archives in ``/custom/path/{service}``\n    sudo batt --path /custom/path\n    \n    # You can specify date patterns (e.g. ``/opt/backup/2014/11/13/22/53/{service}``)\n    sudo batt --path /opt/backup/%Y/%m/%d/%H/%M\n    \n    # Another ... ``/opt/backup/2014/11/13/daily/{service}``\n    sudo batt --path /opt/backup/%Y/%m/%d/daily\n\n\nMore details about the date format is available `here <https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior>`_.\n\nArchitecture\n============\n\nbatt\n-------------\n\nPython based script, effectively parses the various arguments and manage the services list. Then it delegates the work to the services scripts.\n\nbackup scripts\n--------------\n\nThey are stored in ``/opt/batt/scripts-available``.\n\nIn practice they can be based on any language; shell, python, ruby, etc. as long as they follow the naming convention ``backup-{service}`` and are executable.\n\nThe ``BATT_DEST`` ENV variable is passed to them and define the prefix path where to store the resulting backup archive.\n\nSpace separated arguments are passed to the script (databases, files, etc.) that the script may choose to use or ignore.\n\nbackup scripts: any language; currently mostly shell script to make use of the regular shell commands.\n\nTODO\n====\n\nLots of things to do... A quick list below non-prioritized.\n\n- Better best practices for each of the service' backup logic\n- Better error management\n- Use log file / syslog\n- Remote storage (S3 / etc.)\n- Restore\n- Notification (email / etc.)\n- More technologies\n- More flexible command; allow drop in place of technologies\n- Documentation; how to add scripts, etc.\n- Better configuration support\n- Purge backup support (e.g. after 7 days)\n- MySQL transaction vs lock for InnoDB / MyISAM\n- Handle LVM based backup (and more generally snapshot capable filesystems like ZFS)\n\nDisclaimer\n==========\n\nThe ``batt`` tool is in early development stage and may break, erase data, corrupt filesytem, burn trees, spill coffee on your keyboard and may even be responsible for global warming (who knows!).

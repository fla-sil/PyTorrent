The model takes the general form of a Siamese network, with two images filtered through the same convolutional neural network before a classification is made concerning the probability that the two images are a match. In order to train the model, frames were extracted from a set of high-resolution video files of movies and a corresponding set of lower-quality recordings of those movies. Randomly selected frames from the high-quality files were paired with the corresponding frame from the recorded version (a match) as well as a frame from another movie (not a match); these are referred to as triplets. Each of the images is run through the initial set of convolutional layers, which take the structure and weightings from the pre-trained VGG16 neural network, and a vector of length 4096 is returned. This serves as the input to a new set of top layers meant to classify the paired images as a match or not. In addition to the feature extraction and classification model, a means of aligning the recorded clip with the full movie is implemented to optimize the neural net performance. The top level function outputs a single probability of infringement that emerges as the average of the predicted match probabilities along the length of the potentially infringing clip.", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/doughertyeric/cimese_net", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "cimese_net", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/cimese_net/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/cimese_net/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://github.com/doughertyeric/cimese_net"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/cimese_net/0.37/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Basic implementation of a Siamese network structure for detecting copyright infringement", "version": "0.37", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>A neural network is implemented here to detect copyrigt infringement violations in newly uploaded video files.

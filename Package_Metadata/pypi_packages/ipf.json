IPF\nfocuses narrowly on gatethering and publishing, and not on analyzing or visualizing information. IPF grew out of\nwork to publish information about TeraGrid compute resources using the\n[GLUE 2 specification](http://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.147.pdf). IPF continues to support data gathering and\npublishing in the XSEDE program which succeeded TeraGrid.\n\nIPF gathers and publishes information using simple workflows. These workflows are defined using JSON (see the\netc/workflows directory) and steps in the workflows are implemented as Python classes. Each step in the\nworkflow can require input Data, can produce output Data, and can publish Representations of Data. A typical\nworkflow consists of a number of information gathering steps and a few steps that publish Representations to\nfiles or to remote services (e.g. REST, messaging).\n\nWorkflow steps specify what Data they require and what Data they produce. This allows IPF to construct\nworkflows based on partial information - in the case where there are not steps that produce the same Data, an\nentire workflow can be constructed from a single publish step and its required input Data. At the other\nextreme, workflows can be exactly specified with specific steps identified and the outputs of steps bound to\nthe inputs of other steps. A typical workflow (e.g. GLUE 2) specifies what steps to include but lets IPF\nautomatically link outputs to inputs of these steps.\n\nWorkflows can run to completion relatively quickly or they can continuously run. The first type of workflow\ncan be used to run a few commands or look at status files and publish that information. The second type of\nworkflow can be used to monitor log files and publish entries written to those files. Workflows are typically\nrun periodically as cron jobs. The program libexec/run_workflow.py is for executing workflows that complete\nquickly and the program libexec/run_workflow_daemon.py is used to manage long-running workflows.

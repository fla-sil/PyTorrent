FrodoKEM is a key exchange protocol, which security is based on Learning With Errors problem - simply put it is a problem of solving a system of linear equations with probabilistic soluton, and is based on mathematical objects with regular structure called lattices. Additionally, I created a demonstration application as well in a form of \"terminal-based chat\" (using ncurses implementation in Python) as well as simple benchmark tool allowing the programmer to test efficiency of this implementation. FrodoKEM was implemented as a separate module, which is imported and used in Application module. In a short, Python implementation is several hundreds times slower than C, however it provides some educational value and hopefully better understanding of how this algorithm work. I did my best to at least save Microsoft's comments on what is going on in particular places of the code, as well as put mine in places which I was sure I did understand. Finally, my implementation is much shorter and gives a simple to use, abstract interface for the programmer to use it. It is also most likely as secure as Microsoft's implementation is. \n\n\n\n# Installation \nThe source code is currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/PrzemyslawSamsel/AgainstQuantum).\nThe latest released version is also available for download via pip: \n\n```\n  # python3 -m pip install frodokem-with-chat\n```\n\nor simply\n\n```\n  # pip3 install frodokem-with-chat\n```\n\n# Example \n```python\n  from FrodoKEM.frodo640.api_frodo640 import FrodoAPI640\n  FrodoAPI = FrodoAPI640()\n  p, r = FrodoAPI.crypto_kem_keypair_frodo640() # Generate keypair (priv, public)\n  c, ss = FrodoAPI.crypto_kem_enc_frodo640()    # Generate ciphertext, shared secret => Party B\n  ss1   = FrodoAPI.crypto_kem_dec_frodo640()    # Generate shared secret based on ciphertext => Party A\n```\n\n# Documentation \nFor further details on the usage of these modules, please refer to: [Documentation](https://github.com/PrzemyslawSamsel/AgainstQuantum/)\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/PrzemyslawSamsel/AgainstQuantum", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "frodokem-with-chat", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/frodokem-with-chat/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/frodokem-with-chat/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/PrzemyslawSamsel/AgainstQuantum"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/frodokem-with-chat/1.0.4/", "requires_dist": ["numpy", "pycryptodome"], "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "FrodoKEM implementation and presentation application", "version": "1.0.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Re-implementation of quantum-secure algorithm FrodoKEM in Python 3.x</h1>\n<h1>About</h1>\n<p>This is Python implementation of FrodoKEM (Key Exchange Mechanism), as a result of my bachelor, based on <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/PQCrypto-LWEKE/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft's implementation in C</a>, but using OOP (and NumPy for matrix operations).

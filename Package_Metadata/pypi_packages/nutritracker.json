After that you can pair fields and add custom foods.  Or just use the stock database to start making recipes and tracking simple meals.\n\nEventually you can track more fields and metrics on a daily basis, include more on your log, get to know your habits, and benefit from automated suggestions.\n\nDue to the localized nature of the program (i.e. it runs for your computer, on your computer) we are able to outperform some websites in searches.  We can update your search results AS YOU TYPE.  But for the same reason we also face limitations, such as not having a very large Barcode database, or community-driven input.  Mostly we add data to the stock set when someone submits an interesting sample, perhaps only 30 foods.\n\nGenerating Log Reports\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWith the :code:`log` function, you can get detailed information printed in porcelain, color, or chart form (percentages, macros, extendeds, lowest/highest score).  It's possible to filter by date range or nutrient type.  Eventually we will make a seperate analysis command, to analyse any ingredient, food, or recipe across the standard metrics.\n\nThe Android app may be more intuitive for people less familiar with computers, it offers many of the same features and we are constantly working to improve that.\n\nEventually someone can make a GUI interface for the computer that parses the porcelain output, and that may be easier to use.\n\nUsage\n^^^^^\n\nRun the :code:`nutri` script to output usage.\n\nUsage: :code:`nutri <command>`\n\n**Commands**\n::\n\n    user                    create, edit and switch users\n    \n    db                      import, edit and verify databases\n    \n    field                   import, pair and manage fields\n    \n    recipe                  create, edit and view foods and recipes\n    \n    search                  search databases or recipes\n    \n    add                     add foods or items to daily log\n    \n    log                     show previous meals and summary\n    \n    sync                    sync android device\n    \n    contrib                 rank contribution\n    \n    --help | -h             show help for a given command", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/gamesguru/nutri", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "nutritracker", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/nutritracker/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/nutritracker/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/gamesguru/nutri"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/nutritracker/0.0.0.dev0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Home and office nutrient tracking software", "version": "0.0.0.dev0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>An extensible nutrient tracking app designed for home and office use.\nCLI backend.</p>\n<p><em>Requires:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python 3.6.5 or later</li>\n<li>Desktop (Win/mac/Linux)</li>\n<li><em>(Optional)</em> Android 5.0+ phone, USB, adb, developer mode</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"downloading-food-data\">\n<h2>Downloading Food Data</h2>\n<p>Can be downloaded manually, visit these links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/dasheenster/nutri-utils/downloads/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bitbucket.org/dasheenster/nutri-utils/downloads/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search</a> (see downloads, ASCII not Access)</p>\n<p>These can also be downloaded from the Android app, or synced over USB cable, with the exception of the Branded foods database.

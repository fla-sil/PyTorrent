It improves TPS with reducing a pair of votes compared to PBFT when nodes make a consensus. A concept, 'Candidate' has been introduced for keeping safety.\n\nThis is implemented as a library. So not only blockchain but also any application which requires a byzantine fault tolerance consensus algorithm can integrate it.\n\nThis contains an example application for easy understanding. You can run it without integration. Also it composes multiple nodes in this single app. You can simulate byzantine node actions and observe how it tolerates the actions.\n\nThe paper of LFT2 will be released soon.\n\n\n## Example Application\nYou can run example app using this command.\n\n```shell\n$ lft\n```\nThis command runs 4 nodes. They make data as results of consensus. If you want to run it with 10 nodes then run this command below.\n\n```shell\n$ lft -n 10\n```\n\nYou can see a lot of event logs.\n\n```shell\n16:18:34,085 0xd32b RoundEndEvent(is_success=True,epoch_num=1,round_num=1,candidate_id=0xd4ad,commit_id=0x6765)\n```\nEvent log consists of time, node id and event. This log means round 1 ends successfully with deciding a new candidate. Each round makes a consensus to determine one candidate. A candidate is committed after when next new candidate connected to the candidate is decided. In this case `0xd4ad` is connected to `0x6765`. `0x6765` has already been decided in previous round.\n\n#### Replay\n```shell\n$ lft record\n```\nIt records event logs for replaying. The log path is `./data`. It contains all nodes' events.\n\n```shell\n$ lft replay -t 1abde1d6c2eb942df4686116d64f889d\n```\nThe argument `1abde1d6c2eb942df4686116d64f889d` is one of nodes' id located in log path after running with recording command.\n\n## Integration\nSome components are provided for integration. Applications which want to use LFT have to customize abstract classes.\n\n```\nData(Block), DataFactory(BlockFactory), Vote, VoteFactory, Epoch\n```\n\nThe applications have to post the event.\n\n```\nRoundStart\n```\n\nThe applications must listen the events.\n```\nRoundEnd, BroadcastData, BroadcastVote, ReceiveData, ReceiveVote\n```\n\nNote that LFT2 is not responsible for node communication, storing blocks and executing transactions. So the applications must implement them.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/icon-project/lft2", "keywords": "lft icon blockchain", "license": "Apache License 2.0", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "LFT", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/LFT/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/LFT/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/icon-project/lft2"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/LFT/0.1.0/", "requires_dist": ["jsonrpcclient[aiohttp,requests] (==3.3.5)", "jsonrpcclient[aiohttp,requests] (==3.3.5) ; extra == 'app'", "coloredlogs (==10.0) ; extra == 'app'", "ipython (==7.9.0) ; extra == 'app'", "jsonrpcclient[aiohttp,requests] (==3.3.5) ; extra == 'dev'", "coloredlogs (==10.0) ; extra == 'dev'", "ipython (==7.9.0) ; extra == 'dev'", "mock (==4.0.1) ; extra == 'dev'", "pytest (==4.6.3) ; extra == 'dev'", "pytest-asyncio (==0.10.0) ; extra == 'dev'", "jsonrpcclient[aiohttp,requests] (==3.3.5) ; extra == 'lft'", "jsonrpcclient[aiohttp,requests] (==3.3.5) ; extra == 'test'", "coloredlogs (==10.0) ; extra == 'test'", "ipython (==7.9.0) ; extra == 'test'", "mock (==4.0.1) ; extra == 'test'", "pytest (==4.6.3) ; extra == 'test'", "pytest-asyncio (==0.10.0) ; extra == 'test'"], "requires_python": ">=3.7.0", "summary": "Loopchain Fault Tolerance", "version": "0.1.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>LFT2</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"Unittest\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/1df3320bcc0ac6d618365d7d222d09b6cf00647b/68747470733a2f2f6769746875622e636f6d2f69636f6e2d70726f6a6563742f4c4654322f776f726b666c6f77732f556e6974746573742f62616467652e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\">\n<img alt=\"IntegrationTest\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/f13adc739e3a5ebc1c7e6463a2d3704b88895b13/68747470733a2f2f6769746875622e636f6d2f69636f6e2d70726f6a6563742f4c4654322f776f726b666c6f77732f496e746567726174696f6e546573742f62616467652e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></p>\n<p>LFT2 is a new consensus algorithm inspired by PBFT.

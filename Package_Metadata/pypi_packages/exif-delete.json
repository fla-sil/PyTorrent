This metadata can include:\n\n* the location the photo was taken\n* the time the photo was taken\n* detailed information about your camera / phone\n\nFacebook (and the other online advertisers) make money by tracking and selling your personal information. But *you* should be in control of what information you share with the world.\n\nEnter the `exif_delete` tool.\n\nThis is a simple Python script that I use to strip all of the metadata from my photos before I share them online.  It is lightweight, easy-to-use, and fast.  If you are like me, you take a lot of photos, and this tool will help protect your privacy.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThis script will work with Python v3.3 to v3.7 and only requires one third-party library: `PIL`.\n\nTo install from local source:\n\n    python setup.py install\n\n\n## Usage\n\nThis is a simple commandline tool.  Just pass the name of the image file(s) you want to strip to the script, and it will do the rest:\n\n    python exif_delete.py /path/to/my/image.jpg\n\n    python exif_delete.py image1.jpg image2.png image3.gif\n\n    python exif_delete.py /path/to/*/my/images/*.jpg\n\nBy default, the script will create a new image file with `\"_safe\"` appended to the file name.  For instance, this:\n\n    /full/path/to/image1234.jpg\n\nWill become:\n\n    /full/path/to/image1234_safe.jpg\n\nHowever, if you want to just over-write the original image file by stripping all the EXIF data from it, you can add the `--replace` flag:\n\n    python exif_delete.py --replace /path/to/my/image.jpg", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/theJollySin/exif_delete", "keywords": "tool security privacy images exif", "license": "GPLv3", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "exif-delete", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/exif-delete/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/exif-delete/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/theJollySin/exif_delete"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/exif-delete/0.9.5/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "A simple commandline tool to remove the EXIF data from image files.", "version": "0.9.5", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p># exif_delete</p>\n<p>All the photos you share online contain metadata.

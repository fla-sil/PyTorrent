It is the cornerstone\nof a range of approaches that collectively aim to use classroom time\n(usually lectures) more productively than simply as a vehicle for\ndidactic presentation of content. Such approaches often broadly\nclassified as \u2018interactive engagement\u2019 strategies, or \u2014 more recently \u2014\n\u2018flipped classroom\u2019 approaches.\n\nThe learning and retention benefits of interactive engagement strategies\nhas been convincingly demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis by Freeman\net al which examined 225 published studies across various STEM\ndisciplines and course contexts. Relating directly to peer instruction,\nand specifically the efficacy of peer discussion to improve student\nperformance on concept questions posed in class, a 2009 study by Smith\net al (Science 323, 122 (2009)) demonstrates this effect comes from\nenhanced learning, rather than simply peer influence. The impact peer\ninstruction has had was recognized through the award of the inaugural\nMinerva prize for enhancement in higher education to Eric Mazur in 2014.\n\nOne of the key features in the success of peer instruction in enhancing\nstudent learning is to promote higher-order cognitive activities\n(articulation, evaluation, synthesis etc.) within a learning sequence or\nactivity (for example, within a lecture segment in the face-to-face\nenvironment). It is specifically this benefit that we seek to replicate\nand expose within the online environment through this suggestion to\ndevelop online Peer Instruction (oPI) in the functionality within edX.\nTo that effect, we have created the Peer Rationale Reflection Tool. In\nchoosing a name, we wanted to emphasize the fact that a student reflects\non their initial response using the responses of their peers, as well as\nhighlight the importance of the student-provided rationale for their\nanswer selection.\n\nBasic workflow\n--------------\n\n1. In Studio, course creator creates a new advanced problem of type Peer\n   Rationale Reflection, configures and publishes\n2. In the LMS, (following some content presentation) the student is\n   presented the question, answer options and text box to complete their\n   rationale for their answer.\n3. Following submit, the student is presented with a range of\n   alternative student answers and rationales (This is as an alternative\n   to small group discussion)\n4. Students reflect on the answers presented, then modify their own\n   answer and rationale and submit a final answer\n5. Students are presented feedback including their own answer, the model\n   instructor answer and class distribution statistics across both\n   stages.\n6. The Instructor is able to see class statistics on demand at any given\n   time in process.\n\nInstalling Dependencies and this XBlock\n---------------------------------------\n\n::\n\n    cd PATH/TO/SOURCE\n    make deps\n    pip install -e .\n\nRunning in WorkBench\n--------------------\n\n::\n\n    make workbench\n\nRunning Unit Tests\n------------------\n\n::\n\n    make test\n\nor\n\n::\n\n    make test-py\n    make test-js\n\nRunning Acceptance Tests\n------------------------\n\nTo run acceptance test, the devstack has to be running at localhost:8000\nand localhost:8001 (configurable in protractor.conf) with auth auth\nenabled.

Allowed setup of a question with no correct answer.\n2.  Made the instructor-entered rationale optional for case where there\n    is no correct answer.\n3.  Changed text in various locations to reflect option of scenario\n    where there is no correct answer.\n4.  Inserted red asterisks in Studio view as appropriate to further\n    indicate fields as required.\n5.  Fixed display of graphs on mobile.\n6.  Introduced a progress bar, with anchoring as appropriate, to better\n    orient students during each stage of a question.\n7.  Changed colouring of both initial and final answers at last stage to\n    correspond to correct answer, if specified, as appropriate. Initial\n    and final answers are left black for the scenario where the\n    instructor did not specify a correct answer.\n8.  Changed text labels to emphasize answer chosen by student, as\n    appropriate.\n9.  Moved graphs headings above graphs for further emphasis.\n10. Styled (italicized, emboldened) various labels for further emphasis.\n11. Changed name of tool from Peer Instruction Tool to Peer Rationale\n    Reflection Tool, and modified text in various locations as\n    appropriate.\n\n`0.5.3 <https://github.com/ubc/ubcpi/issues?q=milestone%3A0.5.3+is%3Aclosed>`__\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n1.

Added the 'random' algorithm which allows a student to see a\n   completely random selection of others' answers\n2. Added and edited front-end help documentation so that it's more clear\n   what each step is and what will happen at the next step and, if\n   appropriate, why you can't progress to the next step\n3. Added a first-pass at hooking up UBCPI to the edX grading system.\n   This is more of a 'completion' mark as a student is always given the\n   grade after they submit their revised answer regardless of the\n   responses being correct or not\n4.

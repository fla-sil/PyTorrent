It is more an experiment on the components of a game.\r\n\r\nVersions\r\n========\r\n\r\nLater versions have been released, and can be obtained on http://sirolligobbervii.zxq.net/Programming/BlocksandBullets/\r\n\r\nThis version, 0.1, is the only one obtainable as both a python package and as uncompiled code. All later versions are as a zipped pyc file.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nPlease ensure you are running Python 2.7 or better.\r\nEnsure you have extracted the files from the .tar.gz file.\r\n\r\nRun the standard command::\r\n\r\n\tpython setup.py install\r\n\r\nTo do this, open terminal, cmd, or your nearest equivalent.\r\nNavigate to the location of the extracted files.\r\nRun the command above.\r\n\r\nIf you are running on Windows, and the above does not work, try::\r\n\r\n\tsetup.py install\r\n\r\nIf you are running Ubuntu and the above does not work, add sudo to the start and see how it goes.\r\n\r\nGame Setup\r\n==========\r\n\r\nRunning the game should be done by running python command line and typing in::\r\n\r\n\timport BlocksandBullets\r\n\r\nTo start, simply enter the amount of players, from 2 to 15. Then, give each character their name of 1-25 characters that cannot be the same between characters, and a symbol, the 1 character that is their playing piece, and cannot be a hash, arrow including v or space.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended you resize the window to be slightly taller than default.\r\n\r\n\r\nControls\r\n========\r\n\r\nType in each command then press enter.\r\n\r\nWASD to move, E to reload, and SPACE to shoot.\r\n8426 to move, 0 to reload, and 0 to shoot.\r\nAlternatively type each command, eg \"Up\", \"Reload\", \"Shoot\".\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n========\r\n\r\nEach player is allocated 10 hp and 10 bullets, as well as a spot on the edge of the 50x30 board, and enough room to move.\r\n\r\nThe board consists of blocks (#), players, and bullets (< v > ^).\r\n\r\nPlayers take turns, either moving a spot, shooting a bullet, or reloading.\r\n\r\nPlayers that shoot with no ammo will miss their turn, as will players walking into blocks, players, or the edge of the board.\r\n\r\nBullets move once per players' go, and so move faster relative to players the more players there are. For example, with two players, a bullet moves twice as fast as players, whereas with 15 players, bullets move 15 times as fast as players.\r\n\r\nA bullet hitting a player will knock of 1 hp and be destroyed, bullets hitting a wall will destroy both the bullet and the wall, bullets colliding will be destroyed, and bullets two bullets hitting a wall at the same time will both be destroyed, as well as the wall.\r\n\r\nA player with 0 hp will dissapear.\r\n\r\nWhen 1 player remains they will be declared winner, but if none remain, the game will be declared a draw.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n==========\r\n\r\nReport bugs to olligobber, at http://sirolligobbervii.zxq.net/", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://sirolligobbervii.zxq.net/Programming/BlocksandBullets/", "keywords": "", "license": "LICENSE.txt", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "Blocks-and-Bullets", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Blocks-and-Bullets/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Blocks-and-Bullets/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://sirolligobbervii.zxq.net/Programming/BlocksandBullets/"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Blocks-and-Bullets/0.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A simple game of Blocks and Bullets", "version": "0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>Blocks and Bullets is a simple game, which at the moment has little gameplay value.

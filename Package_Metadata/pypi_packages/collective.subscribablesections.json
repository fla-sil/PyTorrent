Here, you can mark the Folder as being an\\n\"Open\" or \"Closed\" section. We will assume you create an Open Section first, in\\nthe site root. It will be Private by default, otherwise make it so. Note that\\nthe title and description will be exposed, to provide potential subscribers\\nsome information about what they\\'re signing up for.\\n\\nAfter marking the Folder as a Subscribable Section in this manner, an extra tab\\n\"Subscriptions\" appears (next to \"Sharing\"). Here you can view subscriptions\\nand subscription requests for the Subscribable Section. \\n\\nAlso, you should see a portlet in the right column which shows your recently\\ncreated \"Open Section\". The portlet was added when the product was installed,\\nand only shows when there are Subscribable Sections. \\n\\nSubscribing to an Open Section\\n------------------------------\\n\\nA Member without any further privileges won\\'t see the Open Section in the\\nsite\\'s sections menu, but will see it in the portlet. Clicking it takes you to\\nit. You\\'ll be redirected to the Plone\\'s `insufficient_privileges` form, which\\nis patched to not display the \"Insufficient Privileges\" message, but which\\ninstead tells you that this is a Section for which a subscription is required,\\nand there\\'ll be a link to subscribe to the Section. The title and description\\nof the Section will be visible, so you know what the Section is about..\\n\\nClicking the subscription link on the Open Section will immediately grant you\\nthe Reader role on the Section. You\\'ll be redirected to the default view of the\\nSection, and a portal message will tell you your subscription was succesful.\\n\\nViewing and removing subscriptions\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nAs the Manager, you will now see this member\\'s subscription in the\\n\"Subscriptions\" overview. You will also find the user has the \"Reader\" role\\nunder the Sharing tab. \\n    \\n    If there are members in the Sharing list that are not in the Subscribers\\n    list, it means that they have not been added via this product. You can only\\n    manage these members through Plone\\'s Sharing form (and not via our \"Manage\\n    subscriptions\" screen), because these members are not subscribers.\\n\\n    If you revoke a subscriber\\'s Reader role from the Sharing tab, the\\n    subscriber will also not show up as a subscriber in the \"Manage\\n    subscriptions\" screen anymore. \\n\\nIn this form, you can check the box to remove the subscription. Submit the\\nform, and you\\'ll see the subscription has disappeared.  If you look under\\n\"Sharing\", you\\'ll notice the Reader role has also been removed.\\n\\nSubscribing to a Closed Section\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThis is similar to subscribing to an Open Section, but after subscribing you\\'ll\\nsee a list of your subscriptions. The top of the screen shows a message which\\nsays that your subscription request has been added.\\n\\nAs a manager, you will see this request in the \"Subscription requests\" portlet\\nwhich was also added to the right column upon product installation. Clicking\\nthe link will take you to the Section\\'s \"Manage subscriptions\" page.\\n\\nApproving subscriptions\\n-----------------------\\n\\nOn the subscriptions management form of the Closed Section, the Manager will\\nsee a list of subscription requests. Checking the box in the \"Approve\" column\\nand submitting the form will approve the request: You\\'ll see a portal message\\nsaying the subscription was approved. You\\'ll see the user has been moved from\\nthe \"Requests\" to the \"Subscriptions\" list. Looking at the \"Sharing\", you\\'ll\\nnotice the user has been granted the Reader role.\\n\\n\\nContinuous integration testing\\n==============================\\n\\n.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/collective/collective.subscribablesections.png\\n    :target: http://travis-ci.org/collective/collective.subscribablesections\\n\\nHave an idea?

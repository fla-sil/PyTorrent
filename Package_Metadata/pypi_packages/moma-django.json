Created and maintained by [Gadi Oren](http://twitter.com/gadioren), as a part of the [Lucidel](http://lucidel.com) and [Cloudoscope](http://cloudoscope.com) products.\n\n* License: GPL license\n* Documentation: http://moma-django.rtfd.org.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n* Adoption: changing a model to reside on MongoDB is as simple as changing the inheritance from django.db.models.Model to MongoModel!\n* Model features: large subset of the model capabilities is supported (e.g. unique together)\n* Enhanced model: Mongo models can include lists and dictionaries as a field\n* Django administration: most of the administration functions are supported for Mongo based models\n* Testing: support the creation of an alternative mongodb collection for unit tests\n* Relationships between models on SQL db and Mongo: limited support. ForeignKeys can be defined but transactions or cascading delete is not supported\n* Django query: support for queries (e.g. `date__gte` notation) as well as Q statements. Not supported yet: annotations and aggregations\n* Enhanced Django query: queries can include \"drill into\" objects. E.g. for a record `entry = {a:3, b:{k1:4, k2:3,km:'a'}}` you can query: `qs = Entry.objects.filter(a__gte=2,b__km__regexp='^a$') )` (note the `b__km__regexp` \"drill into\")\n* South: applications can contain regular and mongo models. However, in order to use south, the mongo models should be excluded of the south management (see documentation on how to exclude mongo models)\n* loaddata_mongo: utility that allows loading of fixtures\n\n\nWhy?\n====\nThere are other packages out there that create tight integration between MongoDB and django. **Why use this one?**\nThis package was originally created as a part of very careful experimentation with MongoDB, and developed in small increments. The reason was\nthat we couldn't afford a radical change like replacing the entire Django or moving completely to a NoSQL type of environment.\nThis package allowed us to enjoy both worlds without massive impact on the project. It is used in production, as part of a high scale & performance project.\nIf that is the type of decision and constraints that you are facing, this package may be a good option.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n\nGet MongoDB::\n\n    Download the right version per http://www.mongodb.org/downloads\n\nGet pymongo:\n\n    pip install pymongo=>2.1.1\n\nGet the code::\n\n    pip install moma-django==0.1.0\n\nInstall the dependency in your settings.py::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n    ...\n    'moma_django',\n    ...\n    )\n\nDocumentation\n==============\n\nAll the documentation for this project is hosted at http://moma-django.readthedocs.org.\n\n\n\nDependencies\n============\n* Django 1.4.1\n* PyMongo 2.1.1\n* djangotoolbox 0.9.2\n\n\nQuick start\n===========\n\n* Install (or clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/gadio/moma-django.git`).\n* Please read \"Example application README\" (https://github.com/gadio/moma-django/tree/master/moma_example/README.md) about running the example application.\n\n\nVersioning\n============\n\nReleases will be numbered with the following format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nAnd constructed with the following guidelines:\n\n* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)\n* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)\n* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch\n\n\n\nBug tracker\n============\n\nHave a bug?

We've even provided a [repo file](https://github.com/juicer/juicer/blob/master/docs/juicer.repo) that you can place in /etc/yum.repos.d/ . From there, run\n\n    $ yum install juicer juicer-admin\n\nand you're set!\n\n## Setting Up and Contributing\n\n1.

Pulp ships with a default user whose name and password are both admin. If you've changed that, it's fine. If not, Juicer provides an easy way to do so! Either way, put your account credentials in your juicer.conf. There's really only two things left to configure Pulp for use with Juicer.\n\nFirst, you need to decide on how many Pulp environments you're going to have. At least three (dev, qa, and prod) is recommended. Then, configure Juicer to use them.\n\n    $ man juicer.conf\n\n\nNow you're ready to start creating release carts!\n\n### Upload an rpm into a repository\n\n    $ juicer rpm upload -r juicy-software ~/Downloads/juicer-0.1.7-1.fc17.noarch.rpm\n\n### Example Workflow\n\nStart by creating a release cart `MyJuicyRelease` with items from the Internet:\n\n    $ juicer cart create MyJuicyRelease -r juicy-software https://my.sweet.host/pulp/repos/dev/juicy-software/juicer-0.1.7-1.fc17.noarch.rpm\n\nThen push the cart and its contents to pulp:\n\n    $ juicer cart push MyJuicyRelease\n\nWhen you're satisfied, promote the cart to the next environment\n(perhaps `stage`, or `production`):\n\n    $ juicer cart promote MyJuicyRelease\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/juicer/juicer", "keywords": null, "license": "GPLv3+", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "juicer", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/juicer/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/juicer/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/juicer/juicer"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/juicer/0.7.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Administer Pulp and Release Carts", "version": "0.7.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p># Juicer</p>\n<p>## What is Juicer?</p>\n<p>From a Release Engineering point of view, Juicer is a collection of\ntools for administering Pulp [1], a Fedora Hosted Project for managing\nyum repositories.</p>\n<p>Juicer allows you to remotely manage repositories in multiple\nenvironments such as QA, STAGE, or PROD as well as upload and promote\nrpm packages through a Pulp installation.</p>\n<p>[1] Pulp  <a href=\"https://fedorahosted.org/pulp/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://fedorahosted.org/pulp/</a></p>\n<p>## Download</p>\n<p>We have a [public yum repository](<a href=\"http://tbielawa.fedorapeople.org/juicer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tbielawa.fedorapeople.org/juicer/</a>) set up for your convenience!

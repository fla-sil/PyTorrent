It provides ***ready-to-use models***, handles ***data preprocessing and augmentation***, tracks your AI's ***training sessions*** and provides other goodies such as an ***automatic REST interface***.\n\nHere is how it looks in action:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/vergeml/vergeml/raw/master/docs/img/term.png\" alt=\"terminal\" width=\"691px\"/>\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nVergeML runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS. You need to have Python 3.6 and [TensorFlow installed](docs/installation.md).\n\nGet VergeML via pip:\n\n    pip install vergeml\n\nVerify your installation by typing:\n\n    ml help\n\nCongratulations, you have successfully installed VergeML! If you need further help, see the full [installation guide](docs/installation.md).\n\nQuick Start\n===========\n\nLet's create a very simple image classifier which tells apart cats from dogs.\n\nFirst, we create a new project for our classifier. Projects help you organize your data, save your training results and compare the performance between trained AIs.\n\nGo to the directory where you want to create your project and type:\n\n    ml --model=imagenet new cats_dogs\n\nThis sets up a model based on [Keras](https://keras.io) called ```imagenet```, which is based on transfer learning.\n\nLet's change to this project directory and have a look:\n\n    cd cats_dogs\n\nVergeML will automatically create a samples folder and a configuration file (vergeml.yaml). Among other things, this configuration file defines the current model.\n\nLet's get some help on what we can do with the current model:\n\n    ml help\n\nIn the output you will see a section on model functions. It says we have two model functions, train and predict. Let's try training first!\n\nStart training!\n-----------\n\nTo start training an AI we will need a dataset:\n\n    ml download:cats-and-dogs\n\n> Info: VergeML provides several datasets to get you started. To see a list type ```ml help download```\n\nAfter the download has finished, you will see a lot of images in your ```samples``` directory divided into two folders: cats and dogs.\n\nLater, when you use your own data, simply copy your images into subdirectories of the samples directory. VergeML will automatically pick up the directory names as labels.\n\nTo start training, type:\n\n    ml train\n\nAs a first step, VergeML will feed each of our images into a pretrained neural network, extract their features as output and cache it on disk. (On a GPU, this will typically take around 15 minutes.) Then it will train a new neural network based on this output. As a last step it will combine these two networks into a single network tailored for our task of classifying cats and dogs. This process is called \"transfer learning\".\n\nVergeML will print out the test accuracy after our training is finished to evaluate the model's final performance. Our cats-and-dogs classifier achieves 98.6%, which is pretty good.\n\n> Info: By default, VergeML reserves 10% of your samples as validation and 10% as testing data. This step is required to measure the accuracy of your model.\n\nWe can inspect our model's performance using the list command:\n\n    ml list\n\nThis will give you the name (prefixed by the @ sign) and several performance metrics.\n\nFor instance, the training accuracy (```acc```) will tell you how good your AI can classify the images it sees during training, while validation accuracy (```val_acc```) tells you how well it performs with unseen images.\n\nUsing the AI from the command line\n-----------\n\nOur cats-and-dogs classifier is now ready to use. Let's point it to an image of a cat or a dog and see what it predicts:\n\n    ml @name-of-your-AI predict <filename>\n\n> Info: You can even point it to a directory: ```ml @name-of-your-AI predict my_cats_and_dogs_pictures/*```\n\nLaunching a REST service\n-----------\nFinally, let's deploy our newly trained AI on a web service:\n\n    ml @name-of-your-AI run:rest\n\nVergeML provides an API explorer that will launch in a new browser window. (If you don't want the browser to open use the ```--no-browser``` option.)\n\nFor example, to use the REST interface with cURL:\n\n    curl -F 'files=@path/to/image' http://localhost:2204/predict\n\n\nLicense\n============\n[MIT](/LICENSE)\n\nCopyright (c) 2018-2019 Markus Ecker\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/vergeml/vergeml", "keywords": "ai deep learning", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "vergeml", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/vergeml/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/vergeml/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://github.com/vergeml/vergeml"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/vergeml/0.1.5/", "requires_dist": ["numpy", "pyyaml", "lz4", "scikit-learn", "Pillow", "keras", "waitress", "matplotlib"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Machine Learning Environment", "version": "0.1.5", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p><img alt=\"VergeML\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/6b3a9f68aa8c34dc473b8802ac2ab16f13b6f141/68747470733a2f2f6769746875622e636f6d2f76657267656d6c2f76657267656d6c2f7261772f6d61737465722f646f63732f696d672f6865616465722e706e67\"></p>\n<p>VergeML is a <strong>command line based environment</strong> for exploring, training and running state-of-the-art Machine Learning models.

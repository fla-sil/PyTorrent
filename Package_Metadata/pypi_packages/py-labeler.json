There are two main steps involved in entity matching:\nblocking and matching. The blocking step aims to remove obvious non-matching\ntuple pairs and reduce the set considered for matching. Entity matching in\npractice involves many steps than just blocking and matching. While performing EM\nusers often execute many steps, e.g. exploring, cleaning, debugging, sampling,\nestimating accuracy, etc. Current EM systems however do not cover the entire\nEM pipeline, providing support only for a few steps (e.g., blocking, matching), while\nignoring less well-known yet equally critical steps (e.g., debugging, sampling).\npy_entitymatching seeks to support all the steps involved in EM pipeline.\n\nAt the matching step, users would want to check and verify candidate pairs as matches\nor non-matches.

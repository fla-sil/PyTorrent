You will see a PyQDA icon appear in the PyQDA folder. Double-click this to start PyQDA. This icon can be moved to the Desktop or into the Unity Launcher (on Ubuntu).\nExtract the tar.gz folder.\nOpen a terminal and type the following to install PyQDA::\n\n    # Move to the extracted PyQDA folder.\n    # This assumes the folder is in your Downloads folder.\n\n    cd Downloads/PyQDA-0.1.0\n\n    # Run the install.sh file. The install process will ask for your permission to install PyQDA.\n\n    ./install.sh\n\n\nMETHOD 2:\n\nExtract the tar.gz folder.\nOpen a terminal and type the following to start PyQDA. Of course replace path to directory with the actual file path::\n\n    python /pathtodirectory/PyQDA.py\n\nIf you are using Windows you can double-click the PyQDA.py file to start PyQDA.\n\nDependencies\n=========\n\nRequired\n\n* Python 2.7. PyQDA has been developed using Python 2.7\n\n* PyQt\n\nOptional\n\n* PyPdf to allow importing of pdf text\n\n* igraph to view network graphs of codes and categories\n\nIssues\n=========\n\n* Testing has only been performed on Ubuntu and CrunchBang using English\n  character sets.\n\n* I did have some problems with decoding some Unicode characters and have put in\n  a few workarounds for these.

Any false positives are easily negated by using the\n        same RegExp framework to cancel out the false match.\n        \n        With a few simple steps it can be easily implemented into a CI / CD workflow\n        with tooling such as [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Gitlab CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/).\n        \n        It is currently used in the Linux Foundations project ['OPNFV'](https://opnfv.org)\n        as means to provide automated security checks at gate, but as shown in the\n        examples below, it can be used for other scenarios.\n        \n        Anteater also provides a Virus Total API, so any binaries, public IP addresses\n        or URL's found by anteater, will be sent to the Virus Total API and a report\n        will be returned. If any object is reported as malicous, it will fail the build.\n        \n        Why would I want to use this?\n        -----------------------------\n        \n        Anteater has many uses, and can easily be bent to cover your own specific needs.\n        \n        First, as mentioned, it can be set up to block strings and files with a\n        potential security impact or risk. This could include private keys, a shell\n        history, aws credentials etc.\n        \n        It is especially useful at ensuring that elements used in a staging /\n        development enviroment don't find there way into a production enviroment.\n        \n        Let's take a look at some examples:\n        \n        ```\n        apprun:\n          regex: app\\.run\\s*\\(.*debug.*=.*True.*\\)\n          desc: \"Running flask in debug mode could potentially leak sensitive data\"\n        ```\n        \n        The above will match code where a flask server is set to running in debug mode\n        `` app.run(host='0.0.0.0' port=80 debug=true)``, which can be typical to a\n        developers enviroment and mistakenly staged into production.\n        \n        For a rails app, this could be:\n        \n        ``  regex: \\<%=.*debug.*%>``\n        \n        Even more simple, look for the following in most logging frameworks:\n        \n        `` regex: log\\.debug``\n        \n        Need to stop developers mistakenly adding a private key?\n        \n        ```\n          private_key:\n            regex: -----BEGIN\\sRSA\\sPRIVATE\\sKEY----\n            desc: \"This looks like it could be a private key\"\n        ```\n        \n        How about credential files that would cause a job loss if ever leaked into\n        production? Anteater works with file names too.\n        \n        For Example:\n        \n        ``jenkins\\.plugins\\.publish_over_ssh\\.BapSshPublisherPlugin\\.xml``\n        \n        Or even..\n        \n        ```\n        - \\.pypirc\n        - \\.gem\\/credentials\n        - aws_access_key_id\n        - aws_secret_access_key\n        - LocalSettings\\.php\n        ```\n        \n        If your app has its own custom secrets / config file, then its very easy to\n        add your own regular expressions. Everything is set using YAML formatting,\n        so no need to change anteaters code.\n        \n        Depreciated functions, classes etc\n        ----------------------------------\n        \n        Another use is for when a project depreciates an old function, yet developers\n        might still make pull requests using the old function naming:\n        \n        ```\n        depreciated_function:``\n          regex: depreciated_function\\(.*\\)\n          desc: This function was depreciated in release X, use Y function.\n        ```\n        \n        Or perhaps stopping people from using 1.x versions of a framework:\n        \n        ``<script.src.*=\"https:\\/\\/ajax\\.googleapis\\.com\\/ajax\\/libs\\/angularjs\\/1.*<\\/script>``\n        \n        What if I get false postives?\n        -----------------------------\n        \n        Easy, you set a RegExp to stop the match , kind of like RegExp'ception.\n        \n        Let's say we want to stop use of MD5:\n        \n        ```\n        md245:\n          regex: md[245]\n          desc: \"Insecure hashing algorithm\"\n        ```\n        \n        This then incorrectly gets matched to the following:\n        \n        ``mystring = int(amd500) * 4``\n        \n        We set a specific ignore RegEx, so it matches and then is unmatched by the\n        ignore entry.\n        \n        ``mystring.=.int\\(amd500\\).*``\n        \n        Yet other instance of ``MD5`` continue to get flagged.\n        \n        Binaries\n        --------\n        \n        With anteater, if you pass the argument ``--binaries``, any binary found\n        causes a build failure on the originating pull request. It is not until a\n        sha256 checksum is set within anteater's YAML ignore files, that the build is\n        allowed to pass.\n        \n        This means you can block people from checking in compiled objects, images, PDFs\n        etc that may have an unknown origin or tampering with the existing binary files.\n        \n        An example:\n        \n        ```\n        $ anteater --binaries --project myproj --patchset /tmp/patch\n        Non Whitelisted Binary file: /folder/to/repo/images/pal.png\n        Please submit patch with this hash: 3aeae9c71e82942e2f34341e9185b14b7cca9142d53f8724bb8e9531a73de8b2\n        ```\n        Let's enter the hash::\n        ```\n        binaries:\n          images/pal.png:\n            - 3aeae9c71e82942e2f34341e9185b14b7cca9142d53f8724bb8e9531a73de8b2\n        ```\n        Run the job again::\n        ```\n        $ anteater --binaries --project myproj --patchset /tmp/patch\n        Found matching file hash for: /folder/to/repo/images/pal.png\n        ```\n        \n        This way we can sure binaries are not tampered with by means of a failed\n        cryptographic signature / checksum.\n        \n        Any binaries not having a sha256 checksum will also be sent to the Virus Total\n        API for scanning.\n        \n        Virus Total API\n        ---------------\n        \n        If the following flags (combined or individually) ``--ips``, ``-urls``, ``--binaries``\n        are used, anteater will perform a lookup to the Virus Total API.\n        \n        IP addresses, will be have their DNS history checked for any previous or present connection\n        with known black listed domains marked as malicious or containing malware.\n        \n        URLs, will be checked for any previous or present connection with known black listed domains\n        marked as malicious or containing malware.\n        \n        As mentioned, Binaries will be sent to Virus Total and verified as clean / infected.\n        \n        For more details and indepth documentation, please visit [readthedocs](http://anteater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n        \n        Last of all, if you do use anteater, I would love to know (twitter: @lukeahinds)\n        and pull requests / issues are welcome!\n        \nKeywords: anteater\nPlatform: UNKNOWN\nClassifier: Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha\nClassifier: Intended Audience :: Developers\nClassifier: License :: OSI Approved :: Apache Software License\nClassifier: Natural Language :: English\nClassifier: Programming Language :: Python :: 3\nClassifier: Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: CPython\nClassifier: Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: PyPy\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/anteater/anteater", "keywords": "", "license": "Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004 http://www.apache.org/licenses/", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "anteater", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/anteater/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/anteater/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/anteater/anteater"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/anteater/0.22/", "requires_dist": ["PyYAML", "binaryornot", "docopt", "pylimit", "redis", "requests", "six"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Anteater - CI Validation Framework", "version": "0.22", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION<br><br>   1.

Any false positives are easily negated by using the<br>        same RegExp framework to cancel out the false match.<br>        <br>        With a few simple steps it can be easily implemented into a CI / CD workflow<br>        with tooling such as [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Gitlab CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/).<br>        <br>        It is currently used in the Linux Foundations project ['OPNFV'](https://opnfv.org)<br>        as means to provide automated security checks at gate, but as shown in the<br>        examples below, it can be used for other scenarios.<br>        <br>        Anteater also provides a Virus Total API, so any binaries, public IP addresses<br>        or URL's found by anteater, will be sent to the Virus Total API and a report<br>        will be returned. If any object is reported as malicous, it will fail the build.<br>        <br>        Why would I want to use this?<br>        -----------------------------<br>        <br>        Anteater has many uses, and can easily be bent to cover your own specific needs.<br>        <br>        First, as mentioned, it can be set up to block strings and files with a<br>        potential security impact or risk. This could include private keys, a shell<br>        history, aws credentials etc.<br>        <br>        It is especially useful at ensuring that elements used in a staging /<br>        development enviroment don't find there way into a production enviroment.<br>        <br>        Let's take a look at some examples:<br>        <br>        ```<br>        apprun:<br>          regex: app\\.run\\s*\\(.*debug.*=.*True.*\\)<br>          desc: \"Running flask in debug mode could potentially leak sensitive data\"<br>        ```<br>        <br>        The above will match code where a flask server is set to running in debug mode<br>        `` app.run(host='0.0.0.0' port=80 debug=true)``, which can be typical to a<br>        developers enviroment and mistakenly staged into production.<br>        <br>        For a rails app, this could be:<br>        <br>        ``  regex: \\&lt;%=.*debug.*%&gt;``<br>        <br>        Even more simple, look for the following in most logging frameworks:<br>        <br>        `` regex: log\\.debug``<br>        <br>        Need to stop developers mistakenly adding a private key?<br>        <br>        ```<br>          private_key:<br>            regex: -----BEGIN\\sRSA\\sPRIVATE\\sKEY----<br>            desc: \"This looks like it could be a private key\"<br>        ```<br>        <br>        How about credential files that would cause a job loss if ever leaked into<br>        production? Anteater works with file names too.<br>        <br>        For Example:<br>        <br>        ``jenkins\\.plugins\\.publish_over_ssh\\.BapSshPublisherPlugin\\.xml``<br>        <br>        Or even..<br>        <br>        ```<br>        - \\.pypirc<br>        - \\.gem\\/credentials<br>        - aws_access_key_id<br>        - aws_secret_access_key<br>        - LocalSettings\\.php<br>        ```<br>        <br>        If your app has its own custom secrets / config file, then its very easy to<br>        add your own regular expressions. Everything is set using YAML formatting,<br>        so no need to change anteaters code.<br>        <br>        Depreciated functions, classes etc<br>        ----------------------------------<br>        <br>        Another use is for when a project depreciates an old function, yet developers<br>        might still make pull requests using the old function naming:<br>        <br>        ```<br>        depreciated_function:``<br>          regex: depreciated_function\\(.*\\)<br>          desc: This function was depreciated in release X, use Y function.<br>        ```<br>        <br>        Or perhaps stopping people from using 1.x versions of a framework:<br>        <br>        ``&lt;script.src.*=\"https:\\/\\/ajax\\.googleapis\\.com\\/ajax\\/libs\\/angularjs\\/1.*&lt;\\/script&gt;``<br>        <br>        What if I get false postives?<br>        -----------------------------<br>        <br>        Easy, you set a RegExp to stop the match , kind of like RegExp'ception.<br>        <br>        Let's say we want to stop use of MD5:<br>        <br>        ```<br>        md245:<br>          regex: md[245]<br>          desc: \"Insecure hashing algorithm\"<br>        ```<br>        <br>        This then incorrectly gets matched to the following:<br>        <br>        ``mystring = int(amd500) * 4``<br>        <br>        We set a specific ignore RegEx, so it matches and then is unmatched by the<br>        ignore entry.<br>        <br>        ``mystring.=.int\\(amd500\\).*``<br>        <br>        Yet other instance of ``MD5`` continue to get flagged.<br>        <br>        Binaries<br>        --------<br>        <br>        With anteater, if you pass the argument ``--binaries``, any binary found<br>        causes a build failure on the originating pull request. It is not until a<br>        sha256 checksum is set within anteater's YAML ignore files, that the build is<br>        allowed to pass.<br>        <br>        This means you can block people from checking in compiled objects, images, PDFs<br>        etc that may have an unknown origin or tampering with the existing binary files.<br>        <br>        An example:<br>        <br>        ```<br>        $ anteater --binaries --project myproj --patchset /tmp/patch<br>        Non Whitelisted Binary file: /folder/to/repo/images/pal.png<br>        Please submit patch with this hash: 3aeae9c71e82942e2f34341e9185b14b7cca9142d53f8724bb8e9531a73de8b2<br>        ```<br>        Let's enter the hash::<br>        ```<br>        binaries:<br>          images/pal.png:<br>            - 3aeae9c71e82942e2f34341e9185b14b7cca9142d53f8724bb8e9531a73de8b2<br>        ```<br>        Run the job again::<br>        ```<br>        $ anteater --binaries --project myproj --patchset /tmp/patch<br>        Found matching file hash for: /folder/to/repo/images/pal.png<br>        ```<br>        <br>        This way we can sure binaries are not tampered with by means of a failed<br>        cryptographic signature / checksum.<br>        <br>        Any binaries not having a sha256 checksum will also be sent to the Virus Total<br>        API for scanning.<br>        <br>        Virus Total API<br>        ---------------<br>        <br>        If the following flags (combined or individually) ``--ips``, ``-urls``, ``--binaries``<br>        are used, anteater will perform a lookup to the Virus Total API.<br>        <br>        IP addresses, will be have their DNS history checked for any previous or present connection<br>        with known black listed domains marked as malicious or containing malware.<br>        <br>        URLs, will be checked for any previous or present connection with known black listed domains<br>        marked as malicious or containing malware.<br>        <br>        As mentioned, Binaries will be sent to Virus Total and verified as clean / infected.<br>        <br>        For more details and indepth documentation, please visit [readthedocs](http://anteater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)<br>        <br>        Last of all, if you do use anteater, I would love to know (twitter: @lukeahinds)<br>        and pull requests / issues

Go check there to see how it works.\n\nIn this library, you send requests as per the onkyo-eiscp spec (volume=55)\nand then ... nothing. All requests are fire and forget. To understand what's\nhappening with the reciever, you'll need to provide a callback_function that\ngets called whenever something changes on the reciever.\n\nYour callback function will recieve a tuple consisting of 3 values (a triple?):\nzone: [main, zone1, zone2, zone3, zone4, dock]\nname: (volume, power, etc..)\nvalue: (volume_up, 55, tv)\n\nI essentially mashed the two projects together and it seems to work so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f...\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n-  Python 3.4 or newer with asyncio\n-  An Onkyo reciever\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can, of course, just install the most recent release of this package\nusing ``pip``. This will download the more rececnt version from\n`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyeiscp>`__ and install it to your\nhost.\n\n::\n\n   pip install pyeiscp\n\nIf you want to grab the the development code, you can also clone this\ngit repository and install from local sources:\n\n::\n\n   cd py-eiscp\n   pip install .\n\nAnd, as you probably expect, you can live the developer\u2019s life by\nworking with the live repo and edit to your heart\u2019s content:\n\n::\n\n   cd py-eiscp\n   pip install . -e\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nThe package installs a command-line tool which will connect to your\nreceiver, power it up, and then monitor all activity and changes that\ntake place. The code for this console monitor is in\n``pyeiscp/tools.py`` and you can invoke it by simply running this at\nthe command line with the appropriate IP and port number that matches\nyour receiver and its configured port:\n\n::\n\n   eiscp_monitor --host 10.0.0.100 --port 60128\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\n-  Most of this package was written by David McNett.\n\n   -  https://github.com/nugget\n   -  https://keybase.io/nugget\n- Pretty much everything else was written by @miracle2k\n- I just mushed it all together.\n\nHow can you help?\n-----------------\n\n-  First and foremost, you can help by forking this project and coding.\n   Features, bug fixes, documentation, and sample code will all add\n   tremendously to the quality of this project.\n\n-  If you have a feature you\u2019d love to see added to the project but you\n   don\u2019t think that you\u2019re able to do the work, I\u2019m someone is probably\n   happy to perform the directed development in the form of a bug or\n   feature bounty.\n\n-  If you\u2019re anxious for a feature but it\u2019s not actually worth money to\n   you, please open an issue here on Github describing the problem or\n   limitation. If you never ask, it\u2019ll never happen\n\n-  If you just want to thank me for the work I\u2019ve already done, I\u2019m\n   happy to accept your thanks, gratitude, pizza, or bitcoin. My bitcoin\n   wallet address can be on `Keybase <https://keybase.io/nugget>`__ or\n   you can send me a donation via\n   `PayPal <https://www.paypal.me/macnugget>`__.\n\n-  Or, if you\u2019re not comfortable sending me money directly, I\u2019ll be\n   nearly as thrilled (really) if you donate to `the\n   ACLU <https://action.aclu.org/donate-aclu>`__,\n   `EFF <https://supporters.eff.org/donate/>`__, or\n   `EPIC <https://epic.org>`__ and let me know that you did.\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/nugget/python-anthemav.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/nugget/python-anthemav\n.. |GitHub release| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/release/nugget/python-anthemav.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/nugget/python-anthemav/releases\n.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/anthemav.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/anthemav\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/winterscar/python-eiscp", "keywords": "", "license": "LICENSE", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "pyeiscp", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyeiscp/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyeiscp/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/winterscar/python-eiscp"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyeiscp/0.0.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Python API for controlling Anthem Receivers", "version": "0.0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p><a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/nugget/python-anthemav\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Build Status\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/5cb3381b582223bdf70ce14940f2df270cd99829/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f6e75676765742f707974686f6e2d616e7468656d61762e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\"></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/nugget/python-anthemav/releases\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"GitHub release\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/7e57993dd436e4f974c9aaf93ead6811e308c53f/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6769746875622f72656c656173652f6e75676765742f707974686f6e2d616e7468656d61762e737667\"></a> <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/anthemav\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"PyPI\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/f945409d6b7f9e28c880e82afdd68307188f886a/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f707970692f762f616e7468656d61762e737667\"></a></p>\n<p>This is a Python package to interface with\nOnkyo receivers.</p>\n<p>This package was created primarily to replace <cite>onkyo-eiscp &lt;https://github.com/miracle2k/onkyo-eiscp/&gt;</cite> which is used in the media_player\nplatform for the <a href=\"https://home-assistant.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Home Assistant</a>\nautomation platform but it is structured to be general-purpose and\nshould be usable for other applications as well.</p>\n<p>The structure of this code is _very_ heavily inspired by the <cite>Python Anthem library &lt;https://github.com/nugget/python-anthemav/&gt;</cite> and the protocol used\nis copied directly from the onkyo-eiscp library.

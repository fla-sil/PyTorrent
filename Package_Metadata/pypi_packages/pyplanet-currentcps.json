It shows the progress of multiple players\non the current track. The players are ordered by their current CP and their time at that\nCP.\n\n### Finished players\nPlayers that already finished the track are shown first, but only the fastest 5\nfinished players are shown. However, each finished player can always see themselves.\n\n### Restart\nWhen a player starts to drive and they haven't reached any CP before, they are shown\nwith CP 0 and a time of 0:00.000. A player that has already reached a CP before and\ndecides to restart is shown with the old CP and time until they pass a CP. The same\nhappens with players that have already finished.\n\n### Spectating\nA player is automatically set to spectator mode when they click on a name in the\nwidget. Of course, the player will be spectating the player they clicked on.\nAlso, players that enter spectator mode via this or any other method, will be\nremoved from the current-CP-list. They will be re-added when they start to drive\nagain.\n\n## Installation\nInstallation of this app is handled by PyPi. To install it, simply activate your\nvirtual environment and type\n```commandline\npip install -U pyplanet_currentcps\n```\nThe same command can also be used to update the plugin and any dependencies.  \nIf you have already installed a version from github, you'll have to remove or\nrename it.\n\n[pyplanet]: https://github.com/PyPlanet/PyPlanet", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/teemann/currentcps", "keywords": "maniaplanet,pyplanet,rpg,checkpoint", "license": "GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "pyplanet-currentcps", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyplanet-currentcps/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyplanet-currentcps/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/teemann/currentcps"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/pyplanet-currentcps/1.0.4/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Current CP widget, useful for RPG servers, App for PyPlanet Server Controller", "version": "1.0.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p># Currentcps\nPyPlanet cp tracker app</p>\n<p>## Description\nCurrentcps is an app for [PyPlanet][pyplanet].

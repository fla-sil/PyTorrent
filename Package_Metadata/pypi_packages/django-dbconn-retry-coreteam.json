Even though you can mostly\nprevent surprises by enabling TCP keep-alive packets through `tcpka`_,\n`clitcpka`_ and `srvtcpka`_, I still encounter situations where the\nunderlying TCP connection has been closed through the load-balancer.

Then add\n``django_dbconn_retry`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings.py``.\n\n\nSignals\n-------\nThe library provides an interface for other code to plug into the process to,\nfor example, allow `12factor-vault`_ to refresh the database credentials\nbefore the code tries to reestablish the database connection. These are\nimplemented using `Django Signals`_.\n\n===========================  ==================================================\nSignal                       Description\n===========================  ==================================================\n``pre_reconnect``            Installs a hook of the type\n                             ``Callable[[type, BaseDatabaseWrapper], None]``\n                             that will be called before the library tries to\n                             reestablish a connection. 12factor-vault uses this\n                             to refresh the database credentials from Vault.\n``post_reconnect``           Installs a hook of the type\n                             ``Callable[[type, BaseDatabaseWrapper], None]``\n                             that will be called after the library tried to\n                             reestablish the connection.

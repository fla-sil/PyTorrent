Provide a tool that can compute recommendations in project `Thoth <https://thoth-station.ninja>`__.\n2. Check provenance of installed packages (which package source indexes are used - this is not guaranteed by pip nor Pipenv).\n3. A tool called \"Dependency Monkey\" that generates all the possible software stacks for a project respecting dependency resolution.\n\nTo interact with a deployed Thoth, you can use the\n`Thamos CLI <https://github.com/thoth-station/thamos>`__.\n\n\nDependency Monkey\n=================\n\nDependency Monkey is a functionality that allows you to generate all the\npossible software stacks for your project. Given the input (direct dependencies\nof your project), Dependency Monkey creates N-ary dependency graph (as\ndescribed above) stating all the dependencies of your direct\ndependencies/libraries as well as dependencies of all the transitive\ndependencies in your application stack.\n\nThe primary use-case for Dependnecy Monkey is to generate software stacks that\nare subsequently validated and scored in the `Amun\n<https://github.com/thoth-station/amun-api>`__ service. Simply when generating\nall the possible software stacks, we can find the best software stack for an\napplication by validating it in a CI (or Amun in case of Thoth), running the\napplication in the specific runtime environment (e.g. Fedora 28 with installed\nnative packages - RPMs) on some specific hardware configuration. Generating and\nscoring all the possible software stacks is, however, most often not doable in\na reasonable time. For this purpose, Dependency Monkey can create a sample of\nsoftware stacks (see the ``distribution`` and ``seed`` parameters) that can be\ntaken as representatives. These representatives are scored and aggregated data\nare used for predicting the best application stack (again, generated and run\nthrough CI/Amun to make predictions more accurate by learning over time).\n\nSee `Dependency Monkey\n<https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/adviser/dependency_monkey.html>`_\nfor more info.\n\nAdvises and Recommendations\n===========================\n\nIn Thoth's terminology, advises and recommendations are the same. Based on\naggregated knowledge stored in the graph database, provide the best application\nstack with reasoning on why the given software stack is used. There is reused\nthe N-ary dependency graph implementation stated above to compute possible\ncandidates of software stacks and based on data aggregated, there is performed\nscoring of software stacks based on solely package-level data (e.g. the given\npackage cannot be installed into the given runtime environment) or software\nstack information - the combination of packages cannot be assembled together or\nthere were spotted issues when the same packages were used together in some\nspecific versions.\n\nProvenance Checks\n=================\n\nAs Thoth aggregates information about packages available, it can verify\na user's stack against its knowledge base. See provenance_checks\nfor more info.\n\nPackage source configuration\n############################\n\nWhen Thoth is deployed in your infrastracture that restricts packages installed\nto only trusted package source indexes, you can disable untrusted package\nsource indexes by setting ``THOTH_WHITELISTED_SOURCES`` environment variable.\nThis variable holds a comma separated list of URLs pointing to whitelisted\npackage source indexes respecting\n`PEP-0503 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0503/>`__ standard (the URL\nis with the ``/simple`` suffix).\n\nThis environment variable is automatically fed from Thoth's graph database\nin a deployment. This way Thoth's operator has full control on what package\nsource indexes which are used by users of Thoth.\n\nInstallation and deployment\n===========================\n\nAdviser is built using OpenShift Source-to-Image and deployed\nautomatically with Thoth's deployment playbooks available in the `core\nrepository <https://github.com/thoth-station/core>`__.\n\nIn a Thoth deployment, adviser is run based on requests comming to the\n`user API <https://github.com/thoth-station/user-api>`__ - each deployed adviser\nis run per a user request. You can run adviser locally as well by installing it\nand using its command line interface:\n\n::\n\n  pip3 install thoth-adviser\n  thoth-adviser --help\n  # Or use git repo directly for the latest code:\n  # pip3 install git+https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser\n\nWhen thoth-adviser is scheduled in a deployment, it is actually executed as a\nCLI with arguments passed via environment variables.\n\nSee `thoth-storages repository <https://github.com/thoth-station/storages>`__\nrepository on how to run Thoth's knowledge graph locally and\nexample `notebooks <https://github.com/thoth-station/notebooks>`__ for experiments.\n\nAdviser also considers environment variable ``THOTH_ADVISER_BLOCKED_UNITS`` that\nstates a comma separated list of pipeline units that should not be added to\nthe pipeline. This can be handy if an issue with a unit arises in a deployment - Thoth\noperator can remove pipeline unit by adjusting adviser template and provide\nthis configuration without a need to deploy a new version of adviser.\n\nRunning adviser locally\n=======================\n\nOften it is useful to run adviser locally to experiment or verify your changes\nin implementation. You can do so easily by running:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n  pipenv install\n  PYTHONPATH=. pipenv run ./thoth-adviser --help\n\nThis command will run adviser locally - adviser will try to connect to a local\nPostgreSQL instance and compute recommendations. `Browse docs here\n<https://github.com/thoth-station/thoth-storages>`__ to see how to setup a local\nPostgreSQL instance. Also, follow the developer's guide to get `more\ninformation about developer's setup\n<https://github.com/thoth-station/thoth/blob/master/docs/developers_guide.rst>`__.\n\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://pypi.org/project/thoth-adviser", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser", "keywords": "", "license": "GPLv3+", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "thoth-adviser", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/thoth-adviser/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/thoth-adviser/", "project_urls": {"Download": "https://pypi.org/project/thoth-adviser", "Homepage": "https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/thoth-adviser/0.9.4/", "requires_dist": ["attrs", "click", "contoml (==0.30)", "fext (>=0.2.0)", "matplotlib", "thoth-python", "thoth-solver", "thoth-storages", "toml", "pyyaml", "voluptuous"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Package and package stack adviser for the Thoth project", "version": "0.9.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>A recommendation engine and software stack generation for project <a href=\"https://github.com/thoth-station/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thoth</a>.</p>\n<p>There are the following main goals of thoth-adviser (as of now):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide a tool that can compute recommendations in project <a href=\"https://thoth-station.ninja\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thoth</a>.</li>\n<li>Check provenance of installed packages (which package source indexes are used - this is not guaranteed by pip nor Pipenv).</li>\n<li>A tool called \u201cDependency Monkey\u201d that generates all the possible software stacks for a project respecting dependency resolution.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To interact with a deployed Thoth, you can use the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/thoth-station/thamos\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thamos CLI</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"dependency-monkey\">\n<h2>Dependency Monkey</h2>\n<p>Dependency Monkey is a functionality that allows you to generate all the\npossible software stacks for your project.

But the slides are hard to read, or got cropped out somehow,\nand you want to fix that. Fear not, superimposer has you covered! Just\ntell it what slide to display when, point it at your slides and your\nvideo, and it will generate a new video for you with the slides front\nand center, and your video tucked away nicely in a corner.\n\nTo get up and running, you first need the video file for your\npresentation (let's say it's `presentation.mp4`) and a PDF file with\nyour slides (let's say it's `slides.pdf`). Then, create a file called\n`transitions.txt` and write:\n\n```\n00:00 1\n```\n\nYou probably get the gist here. Play through your presentation, and\nevery time you change slides, write down a new line with the current\ntimestamp (the `O` hotkey in `mpv` is handy here) and the desired slide\nnumber. When you're done, run:\n\n```console\n$ superimposer presentation.mp4 slides.pdf superimposed.mp4\n```\n\nThis will eventually kick off `ffmpeg`, which will take a while to\nencode your video. When it's done, `superimposed.mp4` should have what\nyou want!\n\nSuperimposer takes a bunch of handy command-line arguments to tweak the\noutput. Run `superimposer --help` to see them. If you're using H.264,\nyou may want to consider also giving:\n\n```console\n-- --tune stillimage\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n - `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` (usually installed with [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/))\n - `pdftoppm` (part of [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/))\n\n## Normalizing audio\n\nIf your audio is sad, try [`fmpeg-normalizer`] with something like:\n\n```console\n$ ffmpeg-normalize superimposed.mp4 -o superimposed-normalized.mp4 -c:a aac\n```\n\n## Hardware acceleration\n\nYou can pass additional parameters to the ffmpeg encoder by placing them\nafter `--` in the argument list to `superimposer`. You'll probably want\nto read up on [hardware acceleration in ffmpeg], and maybe the [ffmpeg\nVAAPI encoding docs].\n\n## Examples\n\nHere are some examples of what the resulting video looks like:\n\n[![Considering Rust](https://img.youtube.com/vi/DnT-LUQgc7s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT-LUQgc7s)\n\n  [hardware acceleration in ffmpeg]: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/HWAccelIntro\n  [ffmpeg VAAPI encoding docs]: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Hardware/VAAPI#Encoding\n  [`ffmpeg-normalizer`]: https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-normalize", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/jonhoo/superimposer", "keywords": "presentation slides video ffmpeg", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "superimposer", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/superimposer/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/superimposer/", "project_urls": {"Bug Reports": "https://github.com/jonhoo/superimposer/issues", "Homepage": "https://github.com/jonhoo/superimposer", "Say Thanks!": "https://twitter.com/jonhoo", "Source": "https://github.com/jonhoo/superimposer"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/superimposer/0.1.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.5, <4", "summary": "Superimpose presentation records onto PDF slides", "version": "0.1.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Superimposer \u2014 combine presentation videos with slides</h1>\n<p><strong>You have</strong>: pdf slides and a video of you talking about them.</p>\n<p><strong>You want</strong>: a video of your slides with you in the corner.</p>\n<p><strong>You need</strong>: superimposer.</p>\n<p>So, you presented something, and now have a recording of it, that's\nawesome!

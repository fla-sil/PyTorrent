The BED file must have 3\nor 4 columns as explained in the standalone application (sequana_coverage) \n`documentation <http://sequana.readthedocs.io/en/master/applications.html?highlight=coverage#sequana-coverage>`_. \nIn short, the first column is the chromosome name, the second column is the\nposition (sorted) and the third column is the coverage (an optional fourth\ncolumn would contain a coverage signal, which could be high quality coverage for\ninstance).\n\nIf you have only BAM files, you can convert them using **bioconvert** tool or\nthe command::\n\n    samtools depth -aa input.bam > output.bed\n\nIf you have a CRAM file::\n\n    samtools view -@ 4 -T reference.fa -b -o out.bam  in.cram\n\nFor very large BAM/BED files, we recommend to split the BED file by\nchromosomes. For instance for the chromosome  chr1, type::\n\n    # samtools index in.bam\n    samtools depth -aa input.bam -r chr1 in.bam > chr1.bed\n\nThe standalone or Snakemake application can also take as input your BAM file and\nwill convert it automatically into a BED file.\n\n\nRules and configuration details\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere is the `latest documented configuration file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequana/sequana_coverage/master/sequana_pipelines/coverage/config.yaml>`_\nto be used with the pipeline.

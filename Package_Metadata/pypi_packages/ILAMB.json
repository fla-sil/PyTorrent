Not only is this needed as basemap is\n  being deprecated, but plotting is now approximately 10x faster. For\n  the most part, this change will be invisible to the user.\n* Added options and structure to `ilamb-run` to improve runtimes. If\n  running a large set of models on a cluster, we recommend first\n  running with the `--skip_plots` option and using a low number of\n  processes per node. This is because memory utilization tends to\n  dominate the analysis phase and you do not want to run out. Then you\n  can submit a second job without `--skip_plots` and using a large\n  number of processes per node.\n* Intermediate files generated during `ilamb-run` will now include a\n  `complete` flag, initialized to `False` and only flagged true if the\n  file closed at the end of the analysis phase without error. This\n  helps us reinitialize `ilamb-run` when a parallel run crashes and\n  leaves file present and not corrupted, but neither complete.\n* If the `psutil` python package is installed, `ilamb-run` will now\n  log the peak memory being used during the analysis phase in the\n  logfiles along with the node name and process rank. This is to help\n  in memory debugging for when high resolution models are being run.\n* In addition to this, `ilamb-run` now caches the model initialization\n  process which should speed up re-initialization for when multiple\n  jobs must be submitted.\n* Added initial support for uncertainty bounds in the\n  ILAMB.Variable. If uncertainty is included in the observations, such\n  as in the Hoffman `nbp` dataset, then ILAMB will automatically\n  operate of it and show it as a shading in plots without changes to\n  your scripts.\n* `ilamb-fetch` now will correctly try to decode server SSL\n  certificates before downloading files. However, the authority that\n  `www.ilamb.org` uses to create its certificates is not in the list\n  that python supports. Your browser maintains a different list of\n  authorities, which is why you can navigate to sites like `this\n  <http://www.ilamb.org/CMIP6/historical/>`_. You will likely need to\n  run with the `--no-check-certificate` option which implies that you\n  trust that we are who we say we are.\n\nUseful Information\n------------------\n\n* `Documentation <https://www.ilamb.org/doc/>`_ - installation and\n  basic usage tutorials\n* Sample Output\n\n  * `CMIP6 <http://www.ilamb.org/CMIP6/historical/>`_ - land comparison against a collection of CMIP6 models\n  * `CMIP5 vs CMIP6 <http://www.ilamb.org/CMIP6/historical/>`_ - land comparison against a collection of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models\n  * `IOMB <http://www.ilamb.org/IOMB/>`_ - ocean comparison against a few ocean models\n\n* `Paper <https://doi.org/10.1029/2018MS001354>`_ published in JAMES\n  which details the design and methodology employed in the ILAMB\n  package.

Building upon past model evaluation studies,\nthe goals of ILAMB are to:\n\n* develop internationally accepted benchmarks for land model\n  performance, promote the use of these benchmarks by the\n  international community for model intercomparison,\n* strengthen linkages between experimental, remote sensing, and\n  climate modeling communities in the design of new model tests and\n  new measurement programs, and\n* support the design and development of a new, open source,\n  benchmarking software system for use by the international community.\n\nIt is the last of these goals to which this repository is\nconcerned. We have developed a python-based generic benchmarking\nsystem, initially focused on assessing land model performance.\n\nFunding\n-------\n\nThis research was performed for the *Reducing Uncertainties in Biogeochemical Interactions through Synthesis and Computation* (RUBISCO) Scientific Focus Area, which is sponsored by the Regional and Global Climate Modeling (RGCM) Program in the Climate and Environmental Sciences Division (CESD) of the Biological and Environmental Research (BER) Program in the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://bitbucket.org/ncollier/ilamb", "keywords": "benchmarking,earth system modeling,climate modeling,model intercomparison", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "ILAMB", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ILAMB/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ILAMB/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://bitbucket.org/ncollier/ilamb"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/ILAMB/2.5/", "requires_dist": ["numpy (>=1.11.0)", "matplotlib (>=2.2)", "cartopy (>=0.17.0)", "netCDF4 (>=1.1.4)", "cf-units (>=2.0.0)", "sympy (>=0.7.6)", "mpi4py (>=1.3.1)", "scipy (>=0.9.0)"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "The International Land Model Benchmarking Package", "version": "2.5", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>We are pleased to announce a new version of the ILAMB package.

The\noriginal version of this app supported just teh AppleTV, but later versions (0.2 onwards) have also supported streaming\nto a Chromecast.\n\nThe external HTTP interface of the AppleTV isn't documented, but there is unofficial information available, primarily at \nhttp://nto.github.io/AirPlay.html, which allowed me to write this.\nThe Chromecast code shown here uses the Google cast API, which is documented but without the work of many people in the\nopen source world I wouldn't have been able to add support.\n\n## Why HLS?\nCreating the HLS stream takes time and delays the start of playback, so why use it? The simple answer is that for large files, once created it starts the playback faster. Additionally, while the stream is being created the video is correctly encoded, allowing a far wider range of formats to be played via the AppleTV than is possible when sending the files directly.\n\n## Status\nIt plays video files via an AppleTV or Chromecast device. \n\nThe http module is still a work in progress. It may see more development depending on how my time go and it's use in some of my other projects. It's bundled here to reduce dependency issues.\n\nBasic logging support has been added, but this needs to be expanded to be more useful.\n\nThe tests provide only a basic coverage, but are useful.\n\nAs always, feedback is welcome and contributions doubly so!\n\n## Todo\n* I really need to add logging support to see what's going on when it doesn't work as expected.\n* The progress bar doesn't work as it should under Python3.\n\n## Notes\n* For HLS support this module requires a recent build of ffmpeg.\n\n## Future Plans\nThis was written for my own use, but there are a few things I have considered for the future. If anyone else finds this useful, that may help with my time planning :-)\n\n* Improve the code :-)\n* Add more logging", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "https://github.com/zathras777/atavism/tarball/0.2", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/zathras777/atavism", "keywords": "appletv video ffmpeg streaming", "license": "Unlicense", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "atavism", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/atavism/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/atavism/", "project_urls": {"Download": "https://github.com/zathras777/atavism/tarball/0.2", "Homepage": "https://github.com/zathras777/atavism"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/atavism/0.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Module to play video to an AppleTV", "version": "0.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            _**atavism** - an evolutionary throwback._<br><br># atavism<br>Python module and script to allow playing videos to an AppleTV or Chromecast.<br><br>## Usage<br><br>&gt; $ atavism ~/Videos/some_video.mp4<br><br>The output is simple :-)<br><br>```<br> Looking for devices...<br><br>     Found Apple TV [AppleTV3,2]  1920x1080 @ 192.168.xxxxxxx:7000<br><br> Search complete.<br><br> Creating the HLS stream...<br>     done<br> HLS stream created: 4 segments...<br><br>    Playback: [###                                               ]   7.031%<br>    Playback: [#####                                             ]  11.081%<br>    Playback: [########                                          ]  16.117%<br>    Playback: [##########                                        ]  21.151%<br>    Playback: [#############                                     ]  26.690%<br>    Playback: [###############                                   ]  31.725%<br>    Playback: [##################                                ]  36.760%<br>    Playback: [####################                              ]  41.796%<br>    Playback: [#######################                           ]  46.834%<br>    Playback: [#########################                         ]  51.866%<br>    Playback: [############################                      ]  56.904%<br>    Playback: [##############################                    ]  61.937%<br>    Playback: [#################################                 ]  66.972%<br>    Playback: [####################################              ]  72.007%<br>    Playback: [######################################            ]  77.043%<br>    Playback: [#########################################         ]  82.078%<br>    Playback: [###########################################       ]  87.113%<br>    Playback: [##############################################    ]  92.148%<br>    Playback: [################################################  ]  97.183%<br>    Playback: [ Completed                                        ] 100.000%<br>```<br><br>This will look for ffmpeg and AppleTV or Chromecast devices on your network.

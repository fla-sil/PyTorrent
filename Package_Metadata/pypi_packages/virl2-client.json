It provides a Python package to programmatically create, edit,\ndelete and control network simulations on a VIRL 2 controller.\n\nIt is a pure Python implementation that requires Python3. We've tested and\nwritten the package with Python 3.6.8.\n\nThe **status** of this package can be considered **Beta**. We're not aware of\nany major issues at the time of release. However, since this is the first\nrelease of the package, bugs might exist. Both in the package as well as in the\nAPI implementation on the controller itself.\n\n## Use Case Description\n\nThe client library provides a convenient interface to control the lifecycle of a\nnetwork simulation. This can be used for automation scripts directly in Python\nbut also for third party integrations / plugins which need to integrate with a\nsimulated network. Examples already existing are an [Ansible\nplugin](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ansible-virl).\n\n## Installation\n\nThe package comes in form of a wheel that is downloadable from the VIRL\ncontroller itself. It should also be available on PyPi after the release of\nVIRL 2 itself. When available on PyPi, the package can be installed via\n\n    pip3 install virl2_client\n\nOtherwise, the wheel can be installed via\n\n    pip3 install ./virl2_client-*.whl\n\nEnsure to replace use the correct file name, replacing the wildcard with the\nproper version/build information. For example\n\n    pip3 install virl2_client-2.0.0b10-py3-none-any.whl\n\nWe recommend the use of a virtual environment for installation.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe package itself is fairly well documented using docstrings. In addition, the\ndocumentation is available in HTML format on the controller itself, via the\n\"Tools -> Client Library\" menu.\n\n## Known Issues\n\nThere are no known issues at this point. See the comment in the *Introduction*\nsection.\n\n## Getting Help\n\nIf you have questions, concerns, bug reports, etc., please create an issue\nagainst this repository.\n\n## Getting Involved\n\nWe welcome contributions. Whether you fixed a bug, added a new feature or\ncorrected a typo, all contributions are welcome.

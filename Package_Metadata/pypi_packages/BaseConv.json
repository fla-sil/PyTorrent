What is baseconv?\n\nbaseconv is a generic _base conversion_ library for Python. It allows you to\nconvert any number between binary, hexadecimal, decimal, octal or any other\nbase you can define. A base is a method of representing numbers; using two or\nmore different _words_ you can represent any conceivable number using an\nordered combination of those words. For example, the _decimal_ base is made up\nof 10 words: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. _Binary_ uses only 0 and 1.\n\nh2. Usage\n\nh3.

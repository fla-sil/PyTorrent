Matching is done via several algorithms, ie email address, email\naddress's domain or the original Odoo algorithm.\n\nThis gives a simple possibility to archive emails in Odoo without a mail\nclient integration.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nIn your fetchmail configuration, you'll find a new list field `Folders to \nmonitor`. Add your folders here in IMAP notation (usually something like\n`INBOX.your_folder_name.your_subfolder_name`), choose a model to attach mails\nto and a matching algorithm to use.\n\nExact mailaddress\n-----------------\n\nFill in a field to search for the email address in `Field (model)`. For\npartners, this would be `email`. Also fill in the header field from the email\nto look at in `Field (email)`. If you want to match incoming mails from your\ncustomers, this would be `from`. You can also list header fields, so to match\npartners receiving this email, you might fill in `to,cc,bcc`.\n\nDomain of email addresses\n-------------------------\n\nMatch the domain of the email address(es) found in `Field (email)`. This would\nattach a mail to `test1@example.com` to a record with `Field (model)` set to\n`test2@example.com`. Given that this is a fuzzy match, you probably want to\ncheck `Use 1st match`, because otherwise nothing happens if multiple possible\nmatches are found.\n\nOdoo standard\n-------------\n\nThis is stricly speaking no matching algorithm, but calls the model's standard\naction on new incoming mail, which is usually creating a new record.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nA widespread configuration is to have a shared mailbox with several folders,\ni.e. one where users drop mails they want to attach to partners. Let this\nfolder be called `From partners`. Then create a folder configuration for your\nserver with path `\"INBOX.From partners\"` (note the quotes because of the space,\nthis is server dependent). Choose model `Partners`, set `Field (model)` to\n`email` and `Field (email)` to `from`. In `Domain`, you could fill in\n`[('customer', '=', True)]` to be sure to only match customer records.\n\nNow when your users drop mails into this folder, they will be fetched by Odoo\nand attached to the partner in question. After some testing, you might want to\ncheck `Delete matches` in your folder configuration so that this folder doesn't\ngrow indefinitely.\n\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/issues>`_.

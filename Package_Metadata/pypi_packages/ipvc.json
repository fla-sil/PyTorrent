It is suitable for any kind of data, not only human readable content. It is also particularly suitable for versioning large files. The underlying concepts are heavily influenced by git and [gitless](gitless.com).\n\n## Caveats\n* The project is purely experimental at this stage, with many missing features (see the TODO section)\n* Due to the [public nature](https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/270) of IPFS data, IPVC might not be suitable for private repositories, unless it is hosted on a private network.\n* Due to the interaction with the IPFS daemon (and possibly Python), IPVC commands are quite slow, unlike snappy git commands\n\n## Why IPFS?\nIPFS with its content addressable merkle-dags is the perfect technology for hosting repositories of data as well as commit graphs.\n\n### Why not just use git?\nWhile there is a [git remote helper for ipfs](https://github.com/magik6k/git-remote-ipld) that translates the git file formats to traversable hash links, there is currently no way of getting interoperability for large files since IPFS has a maximum block size of ~4 Mb and git stores files as single blobs. While a workaround may be available in the future we can therefore not currently recreate compatible hashes using ipld.\n\n## What does it do?\n* The implementation leverages IPFS's merkle-dag data structure for the commit graph, object storage and decentralized bit-torrent-like sharing\n  * Supports large files out of the box, with no need for plugins, manually triggering file packing etc\n  * Enables sharing the burden of seeding (pinning) large versioned datasets, just like bit-torrent\n  * Decentralized publishing using ipns (Inter-Planetary Naming System), no need for a centralized git server (as longs as repostories are pinned (seeded) by anyone else)\n  * Easy browsing of commits and repository content using go-ipfs gateway server\n* Similar to gitless, each branch keeps track of its own workspace and the staging index. This allows for switching branches without having to commit or stash changes first.

Until the Server responds, the Client port blocks\n* A Component can be instantiated multiple times in an application with different port configurations\n* A component has a single operation queue that handles timer triggers and receives messages\n* A component has an executor thread that processes this operation queue\n* Components register functionality e.g. timer_operations, subscribers_operations etc. \n* Component instances are grouped together into a process, called *Actor*\n* An actor receives a configuration (.JSON) file, that contains information regarding the components to instantiate\n* This configuration file also contains properties of all timers and ports contained by the component instances", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/pranav-srinivas-kumar/python-zcm", "keywords": "zeroMQ component actor models protobuf", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "zcm", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zcm/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zcm/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/pranav-srinivas-kumar/python-zcm"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/zcm/1.0.0/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "A lightweight component model using ZeroMQ", "version": "1.0.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <ul>\n<li>ZCM is a lightweight component model using ZeroMQ (<a href=\"http://zeromq.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://zeromq.org/</a>)</li>\n<li>Components are the building blocks of an application</li>\n<li>Components are characterized by ports and timers.</li>\n<li>Timers are bound to an <em>operation</em> and fire periodically</li>\n<li>There are four basic types of ports in ZCM: publisher, subscriber, client and server</li>\n<li>Publishers publish messages and Subscribers receive messages</li>\n<li>Clients request the services of a server by sending a request message; Servers receive such requests, process the requests, and respond back to the Client.

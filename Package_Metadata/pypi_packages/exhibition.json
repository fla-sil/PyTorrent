See LICENSE for the actual text.\n\nWhy though?\n-----------\n\nI've been using Hyde since forever, but I wasn't happy with it. I was also very\nunhappy with other static site generators (SSGs) that used Jinja2 for their\ntemplating needs:\n\n- Pelican and the like are too blog focused. It didn't feel in the spirit of\n  those projects to have anything other than a blog and a few plain pages. I\n  wanted something more freeoform to work with various projects.\n- Hyde is everything I want, except for the complete lack of documentation and\n  a massive code base that needs a lot of work to make it run on Python 3. It\n  is also currently unmaintained.\n\n  - I should also mention that there are huge parts of Hyde that do not use, so\n    starting from scratch made more sense than upgrading what would be (to me)\n    legacy code.\n\nThere are SSGs that aren't written in Python or don't use Jinja2 for their\ntemplates, but I'm not interested in rewriting all the templates for the sites\nthat I have made with Hyde.\n\nWhat's the status of this project?\n----------------------------------\n\nThere are tests, there's some documentation, and I currently use it for a\nnumber of websites, including my personal blog.\n\nPlease feel free to add your site to `the wiki`_ if it uses Exhibition, but\nplease make sure its safe for work and not covered in adverts.\n\n.. _`the wiki`: https://github.com/moggers87/exhibition/wiki\n\nContributions\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nI'm always looking for contributions, whether they be bug reports, bug fixes,\nfeature requests, new features, or documentation. Also, feel free to open issues\nfor support requests too - these are very helpful in showing me where\ndocumentation is required or needs improving.\n\nThere are however some items I won't consider for inclusion:\n\n- Functionality to upload the static site once generated. This is and shall\n  remain out of scope for this project.\n- Windows support. I've tried maintaining packages before that have Windows\n  support. I usually end up breaking it as I have no way to test out my changes\n  on a regular basis.\n- Python 2 support.\n\nCode Of Conduct\n---------------\n\nThe Exhibition project has adopted the Contributor Covenant Code version 1.4.

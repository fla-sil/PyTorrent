Fracture is \n very quick at resolving searches - so this can be a preferable mechanism\n when interacting with data if you have a reasonable idea of what you're looking\n for. \n \nWhen no search entries are present this view will show any _Data Elements_ which\nyou have marked as being favourites - allowing them to be accessed very quickly\nwith no overhead. \n\n\n# Setting up a Project\n\n\nThe qFracture UI offers a wizard to make it easy to setup a new fracture \nproject. This guides you through the process of defining the data structure \nlocation, the plugin locations and where you want to save your project file.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/mikemalinowski/qfracture/blob/master/docs/qfracture_wizard.png?raw=true)\n\nIt will also initiate a short scan of your data location.

The system tray\nallows you to specify an interval time (in seconds), and enable or disable\ntimed scans. \n\nThis approach allows the scanning to occur in a completely different process\nto any qFracture instances which can aid performance, especially if you're \nrunning qFracture from within environments such as Maya or Max etc. \n\n\n# Collaboration\n\nI am always open to collaboration, so if you spot bugs lets me know, or if\nyou would like to contribute or get involved just shout!\n\n\n# Compatibility\n\nLaunchpad has been tested under Python 2.7 and Python 3.7 on Windows and Ubuntu.", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/mikemalinowski/qfracture", "keywords": "fracture data composite qfracture", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "qfracture", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/qfracture/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/qfracture/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/mikemalinowski/qfracture"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/qfracture/0.9.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "qFracture is a lightweight UI atop of fracture", "version": "0.9.2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>qfracture is a Qt based front end exposing a fracture project.

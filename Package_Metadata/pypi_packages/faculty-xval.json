At present, the\npackage mostly offers a way to cross validate models in parallel by means of\nFaculty jobs. To access the functionality one makes use of the class:\n\n```python\nfaculty_xval.validation.JobsCrossValidator\n```\n\nAdditional information is found in the example notebooks provided. Please have a\nlook at the section `Try out the examples` below.\n\nThe package supports `keras` and `sklearn` models. Whilst one can write custom\nmodels that are compatible with `faculty-xval`, no guarantee is given that the\npackage handles these situations correctly, in particular because of issues\nconcerning the randomisation of weights.\n\nTwo sets of installation instructions are provided below:\n\n- If you would like to simply use `faculty-xval`, please follow the\n  `User installation instructions`.\n- If you would like to develop `faculty-xval` further, please follow the\n  `Developer installation instructions`.\n\n## User installation instructions\n\n### Create an environment\n\nIn your project on Faculty platform, create an environment named `faculty_xval`.\nIn the `PYTHON` section, select `Python 3` and `pip` from the dropdown menus.\nThen, type `faculty-xval` in the text box, and click on the `ADD` button.\n\nThe environment installs the package `faculty-xval`, and should be applied on\nevery server that you create; this includes both interactive servers and job\nservers, as explained next.\n\n### Create a job definition\n\nCreate a new job definition named `cross_validation`. In the `COMMAND` section,\npaste the following:\n\n`faculty_xval_jobs_xval $IN_PATHS`\n\nThen, add a `PARAMETER` with the name `IN_PATHS`, and ensure that the\n`Make field mandatory` box is checked.\n\nFinally, under `SERVER SETTINGS`, add `faculty_xval` to the `ENVIRONMENTS`\nsection.\n\nFor cross-validation jobs that are computationally intensive, we recommend using\ndedicated servers as opposed to running on shared infrastructure. To achieve\nthis, click on `Large and GPU servers` under `SERVER RESOURCES`, and select an\nappropriate server type from the dropdown menu.\n\nRemember to click `SAVE` when you are finished.\n\n## Developer installation instructions\n\n### Select a username\n\nBefore beginning the installation process, pick an appropriate username, such as\n`foo`. This does not necessarily need to match your Faculty platform username.\nIn the following instructions, your selected username will be referred to as\n`<USER_NAME>`.\n\n##### Clone the repository\n\nCreate the folder `/project/<USER_NAME>`. Then, run the commands:\n\n```bash\ncd /project/<USER_NAME>\ngit clone https://github.com/facultyai/faculty-xval.git\n```\n\n### Create an environment\n\nNext, create an environment in your project named `faculty_xval_<USER_NAME>`.\n\nIn this environment, under `SCRIPTS`, paste in the following code to the `BASH`\nsection, remembering to change the `USER_NAME` definition on the second line to\nyour selected `<USER_NAME>`:\n\n```bash\n# Remember to change username!\nUSER_NAME=<USER_NAME>\n\n# Install faculty-xval from local repository.\npip install /project/$USER_NAME/faculty-xval/\n\n# Turn USER_NAME into an environment variable.\necho \"export USER_NAME=$USER_NAME\" > /etc/faculty_environment.d/app.sh\nif [[ -d /etc/service/jupyter ]] ; then\n  sudo sv restart jupyter\nfi\n```\n\nThis environment should be applied on every server that you create; this\nincludes both 'normal' interactive servers and job servers, as explained next.\n\n### Create a job definition\n\nNext, create a new job definition named `cross_validation_<USER_NAME>`. In the\n`COMMAND` section, paste the following:\n\n`faculty_xval_jobs_xval $in_paths`\n\nThen, add a `PARAMETER` with the name `in_paths`, and ensure that the\n`Make field mandatory` box is checked.\n\nFinally, under `SERVER SETTINGS`, add `faculty_xval_<USER_NAME>` to the\n`ENVIRONMENTS` section.\n\nFor cross-validation jobs that are computationally intensive, we recommend using\ndedicated servers as opposed to running in the cluster. To achieve this, click\non `Large and GPU servers` under `SERVER RESOURCES`, and select an appropriate\nserver type from the dropdown menu.\n\nRemember to click `SAVE` when you are finished.\n\n## Try out the examples\n\nPlease clone this repository. Examples of cross validation with `faculty-xval`\nfor the different types of model are provided in the directories\n`examples/keras` and `examples/sklearn`. Usage instructions are then divided in\ntwo notebooks:\n\n- `jobs_cross_validator_run.ipynb` loads the data, instantiates the model, and\n  starts a Faculty job that carries out the cross validation.\n- `jobs_cross_validator_analyse.ipynb` gathers the results from the cross\n  validation, reloads the target data, and calculates the model accuracy over\n  multiple train-test splits.\n\nNote that the example notebooks must be run in the order just defined.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/facultyai/faculty-xval", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "faculty-xval", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/faculty-xval/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/faculty-xval/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/facultyai/faculty-xval"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/faculty-xval/0.1.0/", "requires_dist": ["click", "faculty", "keras (>=2.2.4)", "numpy", "scikit-learn", "tensorflow"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Cross validation of machine-learning models on Faculty platform.", "version": "0.1.0", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>faculty-xval</h1>\n<p>Cross validation of machine-learning models on Faculty platform.

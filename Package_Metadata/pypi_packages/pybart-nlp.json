[**Converter:**](#converter-description) The current project.\n2. [**Model:**](https://github.com/allenai/ud_spacy_model) UD based [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) model (pip install [the_large_model](https://storage.googleapis.com/en_ud_model/en_ud_model_lg-1.1.0.tar.gz)). This model is needed when using the converter as a spaCy pipeline component (as spaCy doesn't provide UD-format based models).\n3.

Else, if the marker is not one of \"as/so/when/if\" (this   includes no marker at all which is mostly equivalent to \"while\"   marker), both the subject and the object of the main clause are equivalent   options (unless no object found, then the subject is propagated).</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Noun-modifying   participles</td>\n        <td>(see   [here](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-6507))</td>\n        <td>-</td>\n        <td>-</td>\n        <td>extra</td>\n        <td></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Correct   possible subject of Noun-modifying participles</td>\n        <td>-</td>\n        <td>-</td>\n        <td>-</td>\n        <td>extra</td>\n        <td>1.   This is a correctness of the subject decision of the previous bullet.&lt;br&gt;2.

Moreover, If the modifiers father   is not the immediate conjunction part, then all the conjunction parts between   the father and the modifier are (most probably) modified by the   modifier.&lt;br&gt;2. If the modifier father is the immediate conjunction part, we propagate   the modifier backward only if the new father, doesn't have any modifiers sons   (this is to restrict a bit the amount of false-positives).&lt;br&gt;3. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t propagate modifier forwardly (that is, if the conjunct part   appears after the modifier, we assume they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t refer).&lt;br&gt;4.

The preferred way to install pyBART is via `pip`. Just run `pip install pybart-nlp` in your Python environment and you're good to go!\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pybart-nlp\n   ```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce you've installed pyBART, you can use the package in one of the following ways.\nNotice that for both methods we placed '...' (three dots) in the API calls, as we provide a list of optinal parameters to configure the conversion process. We will elaborate about it next.\n\n### spaCy pipeline component\n\n```\n# Load a UD-based english model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_ud_model\")\n\n# Add BART converter to spaCy's pipeline\nfrom pybart-nlp.api import Converter\nconverter = Converter( ... )\nnlp.add_pipe(converter, name=\"BART\")\n\n# Test the new converter component\ndoc = nlp(\"He saw me while driving\")\nme_token = doc[2]\nfor par_tok in me_token._.parent_list:\n    print(par_tok)\n\n# Output:\n{'head': 2, 'rel':'dobj', 'src':'UD'}\n{'head': 5, 'rel': 'nsubj',\n  'src':('advcl','while'), 'alt':'0'}\n```\n\n### CoNLL-U format\n\n```\nfrom pybart-nlp.api import convert_bart_conllu\n\n# read a CoNLL-U formatted file\nwith open(conllu_formatted_file_in) as f:\n  sents = f.read()\n\n# convert\nconverted = convert_bart_conllu(sents, ...)\n\n# use it, probably wanting to write the textual output to a new file\nwith open(conllu_formatted_file_out, \"w\") as f:\n  f.write(converted)\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nEach of our API calls can get the following optional parameters:\n\n[//]: # (<style>.tablelines table, .tablelines td, .tablelines th {border: 1px solid black;}</style>)\n\n\n\n| Name | Type | Default | Explanation |\n|------|------|-------------|----|\n| enhance_ud | boolean | True | Include Stanford's EnhancedUD conversions. |\n| enhanced_plus_plus | boolean | True | Include Stanford's EnhancedUD++ conversions. |\n| enhanced_extra | boolean | True | Include BART's unique conversions. |\n| conv_iterations | int | inf | Stop the (defaultive) behaivor of iterating on the list of conversions after `conv_iterations` iterations, though before reaching convergance (that is, no change in graph when conversion-list is applied). |\n| remove_eud_info | boolean | False | Do not include Stanford's EnhancedUD&EnhancedUD++'s extra label information. |\n| remove_extra_info | boolean | False | Do not include BART's extra label information. |\n| remove_node_adding_conversions | boolean | False | Do not include conversions that might add nodes to the given graph. |\n| remove_unc | boolean | False | Do not include conversions that might contain `uncertainty` (see paper for detailed explanation). |\n| query_mode | boolean | False | Do not include conversions that add arcs rather than reorder arcs. |\n| funcs_to_cancel | ConvsCanceler class | Empty class instantiation | A list of conversions to prevent from occuring by their names.

If the modifier father is the immediate conjunction part, we propagate   the modifier backward only if the new father, doesn't have any modifiers sons   (this is to restrict a bit the amount of false-positives).&lt;br&gt;3.

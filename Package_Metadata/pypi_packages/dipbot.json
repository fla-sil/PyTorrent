It depends on a couple of environment variables\ndescribed below.\n\nHere is the bot's help dialogue, which describes the commands it\nsupports:\n\n``` shell\nStatus:\n  status   instructs me to report on the status of my webdip game.\n  status!  same as `$status`, but mentioning @everyone\n  status?  same as `$status`, but with additional information about the game\n  status?! same as `$status?`, but mentioning @everyone\n\u200bNo Category:\n  help     Shows this message\n\nType $help command for more info on a command.\nYou can also type $help category for more info on a category.\n```\n\nA `$status` request produces output in the\nfollowing format:\n\n``` shell\n\"It is the [game-phase] of the [season] of [year].\n\nWe are awaiting the orders of:\n[list of non-ready players with their order statuses]\nThere are [N] days until the deadline, which is at [date]\"\n```\n\nrun as `dipbot report`, dipbot will produce the output of `$status`.\n\n## configuration\n\nboth `dipbot daemon` and `dipbot report` receive their configuration\nfrom environment variables. Both need to know which game to look at;\n`dipbot daemon` also needs to know its discord API key.\n\n### compulsory environment variables\n\nIn order to know which game to parse, the environment variable\nWEBDIP_GAME_ID must be set to the corresponding webdiplomacy.com game\nid. This is the number at the end of the webdiplomacy url for the\ngame; for instance, in the following URL, the id is 111111\n\nhttps://webdiplomacy.net/board.php?gameID=111111\n\nIn addition, to host the discord bot yourself it's necessary to create\na bot account as described\n[here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html), and\nto set the environment variable DISCORD_API_KEY to the value of the\nbot's token.\n\nthese [environment\nvariables](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Environment.html)\ncan be set for a single session like this:\n\n``` shell\n$ export WEBDIP_GAME_ID=[game_id]\n$ export DISCORD_API_KEY=[api_key]\n```\nthat will let dipbot work in the current shell; to avoid having to run these commands, you can put the variable assignments in the config file for your shell (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc or whatever).\n\n### handling multiple games\n\nBoth `dipbot daemon` and `dipbot report` will get whatever game has\nthe id specified by WEBDIP_GAME_ID.

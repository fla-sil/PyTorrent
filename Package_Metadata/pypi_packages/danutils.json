It's full of random hacks that I've accumulated and needed\nsomewhere to stick. Many of them probably no longer work. Some that do may be\nstupid ways of doing things, or obsoleted by real libraries.\n\nSome parts are also copied directly from blogs or whatnot; such code is marked\naccordingly.\n\nI'm only putting this online so that I can use it when I need to work with some\nold thing I developed that relies on some random function from here. Feel free\nto use it, but do so at your own risk.\n\n``danutils.do.interact``\n========================\n\nHonestly, the only part of this library that I ever use on a regular basis is\nthe module ``danutils.do.interact``, which, upon import, harvests the locals and\nglobals at that point, calls ``code.interact`` with that namespace, and then\ndeletes itself from the module registry so that it can be imported again. I use\nit when debugging::\n\n  def foo(x):\n    from danutils.do.interact import doit\n    return x*x\n\nIf you run the above, you'll suddenly find yourself at a command line at that\npoint where you imported interact.\n\nSome other things, at least the ones that I remember what they do, are:\n\n``danutils.cuda``\n=================\n\nSome automation tools for building modules with pyCuda. I'm pretty sure various\nother libraries have made this ENTIRELY OBSOLETE.\n\n``danutils.img``\n================\n\nLooks like a bunch of image manipulation functions that are probably already\nprovided by some library or other.

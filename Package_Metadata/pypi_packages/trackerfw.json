It includes a browser plugin which routes all traffic that invades the user its privacy to a local python server. Instead of only cancelling all bad traffic we want to make sure most (if not all) websites keep working but just don't invade your privacy.\n\nTrackerFW **is not** an ad-blocker but a tracker-blocker. It's often used in combination with uBlock Origin.\n\n## Why?\nI was using Ghostery, uBlock, Anti Tracker Protection (Firefox) and a lot of other plugins to block trackers but over time this has a couple of disadvantages:\n\n- Multiple plugins try to block the same traffic\n- Websites broke because scripts couldn't load\n- Websites could see if trackers were being blocked\n\nWith this open-source project I'm trying to solve all these problems.\n\n## How?\nThe browser plugin fetches a list of URL patterns from a locally installed Python server. When a request matches one of the routes the traffic is sent through the Python server which will take further action. Apart from a static file of patterns and actions it also includes some more 'intelligent' block methods.\n\n## Features\n### Currently working\n- List of URL patterns to block traffic or serve another Javascript file so that the website things the tracker is working\n- Firefox browser plugin (will be ported to Google Chrome as well)\n- Python aiohttp basic webserver including SSL support\n- Bit.ly auto-fetcher which uses the BitLy API to fetch the final URL\n- Click tracking redirector which redirects to the final URL without going through a click tracker such as google.nl/url..\n\n### Upcoming\n- Auto-update static tracker list\n- Create ArchLinux, Debian, Fedora packages\n- Port Firefox extension to Google Chrome\n- Auto-install SSL certificate for local webserver\n- Auto remove URL parts that invade privacy (UTM codes etc.)\n- Add A LOT of trackers\n\n## Support\nWe succesfully tested TrackerFw on Linux and Windows.\nMac Osx should be supported as well.\n\nThe webserver is written in Python, you need at least python 3.5 or higher.\nWe will **never** support Python 2.\n\n", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/PrivacySec/TrackerFw", "keywords": "trackerfw tracker-fw anti-track ghostery", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "trackerfw", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/trackerfw/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/trackerfw/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/PrivacySec/TrackerFw"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/trackerfw/0.0.4/", "requires_dist": ["PyYAML", "Jinja2", "aiohttp", "aiohttp-jinja2"], "requires_python": ">=3.5", "summary": "TrackerFw - firewall for trackers", "version": "0.0.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p># ![Logo](extensions/firefox/icons/TrackerFW-48.svg) TrackerFw - &lt;small&gt;Intelligent Firewall for trackers&lt;/small&gt;</p>\n<p>## Installation</p>\n<p>### Webserver</p>\n<p>You can install TrackerFw from PyPi using <cite>pip</cite>:</p>\n<p><tt>`bash\npip install trackerfw\n`</tt></p>\n<p>For testing you can install it locally:</p>\n<p><tt>`bash\ngit clone <span class=\"pre\">https://github.com/PrivacySec/TrackerFw.git</span>\ncd TrackerFw\npip install <span class=\"pre\">-e</span> .\n`</tt></p>\n<p>After this you can run the webserver using the <cite>trackerfw</cite> command.\nThere is also a systemd service file present in the project if you want to autostart the webserver.\nWe are working on packages for Linux and Windows.</p>\n<p>### Browser plugin\nOnly the Firefox browser plugin is available at the moment but it will be ported to Google Chrome as well (which should be quite easy since they seem to use the same webExtensions API).\nThe first alpha version of the firefox browser plugin can be downloaded using [Github Releases](<a href=\"https://github.com/PrivacySec/TrackerFw/releases/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/PrivacySec/TrackerFw/releases/</a>).</p>\n<p>## What?\nTrackerFw is a software firewall for trackers.

If the following represents ones package structure\n.. . ::\n.. . \n.. .  PACKAGE/        # The root folder of ones package.\n.. .   overlay/       # The overlay containing the patches.\n.. .

The packages main file makes it's usual calls to import the `SOURCE` modules but by importing the overlay first ApeMan redirects later imports to use ones patched modules instead.\n.. ::\n.. \n..  import overlay\n..  from SOURCE import *\n..  \n..  ...\n\nOverlay Structure\n=================\n\nWhether it is made available globally or locally ones structures their overlay(s) as follows::\n\n  OVERLAY/        # The root folder of the ApeMan overlay\n   _PACKAGE_.py   # The module containing ones patches, renamed after the source module or package\n   ...            # Further patches provided by the overlay\n   __init__.py    # The file invoking ApeMan; identifying it as an overlay\n\nThe overlays' :file:`__init__.py` file then imports and registers the :class:`ApeMan` instance;\n::\n\n  from apeman import ApeMan; \n  apeman = ApeMan()\n\nwhich intercepts later imports, substituting ones patches for the original modules.\n\nLocal Overlay(s)\n================\n\nLocally one may create an overlay at any level within their package by including a sibling package along side it's modules.\n::\n\n PROJECT/         # The root folder for ones project\n  PACKAGE/        # The root folder of ones package.\n   OVERLAY/       # The ApeMan overlay\n    ...           # The contents of the overlay\n   ...            # The other modules in the package.\n   __main__.py    # The main script importing and using the patched module.\n\nOther modules within ones package may then invoke the overlay via relative import.\n::\n\n import .OVERLAY\n from SOURCE import *\n \n ...\n\nGlobal Overlay(s)\n=================\n\nGlobally, an overlay, is provided as a separate, standalone package.\n::\n\n PROJECT/         # The root folder for ones project\n  OVERLAY/        # The root folder of the ApeMan Overlay\n    ...           # The contents of the overlay\n  PACKAGE/        # The root folder of ones package.\n   ...            # The other modules in the package.\n   __main__.py    # The main script importing and using the patched module.\n\nIn this case the modules in ones package must invoke the overlay using an absolute import.\n::\n\n import OVERLAY\n from SOURCE import *\n \n ...\n\n.. One must explicitly import the features they need as the `OverlayImporter` actually blocks further imports.\n\n.. Note that an overlay package is meant to reside alongside its sibling module to afford the most flexibility. \n.. Whether or not this is possible at every level within a package depends upon how python enforces scoping.\n\n-------\nExample\n-------\n\nConsider patching the :class:`Decimal` class from the :mod:`decimal` module.\n\nMonkey Patching\n===============\n\nThe following structure is the simplest to implement.\n::\n\n PACKAGE/        # The root folder of ones package.\n  _decimal_.py   # The module containing ones patches to the decimal module.\n  __main__.py    # The packages main script, executed when invoked as a module.\n\nWithin :file:`_decimal_.py` import everything from the :mod:`decimal` module then subclass and monkey patch the `Decimal` class; modifying it's string representation.\n::\n \n from decimal import *\n \n class Decimal(Decimal): \n  def __str__(self) :\n   return super().__str__().split(\"'\")[1]\n \nThen within the :file:`__main__.py` file one would import and use the patch as follows::\n\n import ._decimal_ as decimal\n from decimal import Decimal\n \n print(Decimal(42))\n\nThis should output `42` instead of `Decimal('42')` when we invoke the package using :code:`python -m PACKAGE`.\n\nApe Patching\n============\n\nUsing ApeMan we would move the `_decimal_.py` file into a sub-folder called `overlay`, with the resulting structure;\n::\n\n PACKAGE/        # The root folder of ones package.\n  overlay/       # The overlay containing the patches.\n   _decimal_.py  # The module containing ones patches to the decimal module.\n   __init__.py   # The __init__.py script importing ApeMan.\n  __main__.py    # The packages main script, executed when invoked as a module.\n\naccordingly the :file:`__init__.py` file should contain ::\n \n from apeman import ApeMan\n apeman = ApeMan\n\nThe main file is then adapted to reflect the following.\n::\n\n import .overlay\n from decimal import Decimal\n \n print(Decimal(42))\n\nWithout ...\n===========\n\nOne might argue that a cleaner structure still, is as follows\n::\n\n PACKAGE/        # The root folder of ones package.\n  decimal.py     # The module containing ones patches to the decimal module.\n  __main__.py    # The packages main script, executed when invoked as a module.\n\nbut this results in a whole series of clashes and the following error\n::\n\n AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Decimal'\n \n.. Other related errors include : \n.. SystemError: Parent module '' not loaded, cannot perform relative import\n \n.. Essentially the :file:`decimal.py` module gets installed within the  decimal  name space preventing the import of the original library.\n\nEssentially the :file:`PACKAGE/decimal.py` file gets loaded as the :mod:`decimal` module and is assigned under :attr:`sys.modules` reserving the `decimal` key; preventing the subsequent import of the actual :mod:`decimal` module.\n\n.. note ::\n\n   This method actually works if one tells python it's executing a module using the `-m` switch,  :code:`python -m PACKAGE`, but only I found this out after creating the package.\n\n-------------\nCompatability\n-------------\n\nThe machinery underlying :meth:`import` has undergone some radical changes over the lastest releases of Python (Particularly versions 3.3-3.5 and next in 3.7).\nIn light of this ApeMan aims to support a minimal set of features; namely explicit and implicit overlays providing patches whose structure matches their intended source packages.\nAny functionality offered beyond these base features is considered sugar e.g. repeated imports, stacked overlays, restructured patches and substructured patches;\n\n.. tested by the :mod:`*Explcit` :mod:`*Implcit` and  :mod:`*Init` tests (See :ref:`Testing`).\n\n.. table :: Set of features supported by the Python import system in the different Python implementations\n   :align: center\n   :widths: auto\n   \n   ====================== === === === ===\n   Python                 2.7 3.3 3.4 3.7\n   ====================== === === === ===\n   explicit packages       X   X   X   X \n   implicit packages           X   X   X \n   lazy loading                        X \n   C implementation        X   X      \n   Python implementation           X   X\n   ====================== === === === ===\n\nIt should be noted that Apeman has only been developed and tested in Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.6.\nThe Python 3.4 implementation was last tested when the author still had it installed, before switching to 3.6. \nThe author also maintains a flaky build of Python 3.5 but this is not a good testing envvironment as a result ApeMan in 3.5 is flaky.\nGenerally speaking if you're using ApeMan in anything other then Python 2.7 or 3.6 you're on your own.\n\n.. table :: Set of features supported ApeMan under the different Python implementations\n   :align: center\n   :widths: 4,1,1,1,1\n   \n   ======================= === === === ===\n   Python                  2.7 3.4 3.5 3.6\n   ======================= === === === ===\n   explicit packages        X   X   ?

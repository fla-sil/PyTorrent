Update to django-frequently<1.0 and run the migrations to make sure that\n   your DB is at the latest version of the old frequently app\n2. Update the django-frequently to the latest version and install\n   cmsplugin-frequently like described above\n3. Add ``cmsplugin_frequently`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``\n4. Run the first migration via ``./manage.py migrate cmsplugin_frequently 0001 --delete-ghost-migrations``\n5. Migrate your old plugins to this new app via ``./manage.py migrate_to_frequently_v1``\n\nStep 5 deletes your migrations for django-frequently from\n``south_migrationhistory`` because for version 1 we have reset the South\nmirations.

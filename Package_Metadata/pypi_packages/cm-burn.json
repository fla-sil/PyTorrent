The program is developed in\nPython and is portable on Linux, Windows, and OSX. It allows users to\ncreate readily bootable SD cards that have the network configured,\ncontain a public ssh key from your machine that you used to configure\nthe cards.  The unique feature is that you can burn multiple cards in\na row.\n\nA sample command invocation looks like:\n\n```\ncm-burn \u2014-name  red[5-7] \\\n        --key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \\\n        \u2014-ips 192.168.1.[5-7] \\\n        \u2014-image 2018-06-27-raspbian-stretch\n```\n\nThis command creates 3 SD cards where the hostnames `red5`, `red6`, `red 7`\nwith the network addresses `192.168.1.5`, `192.168.1.6`,\nand `192.168.1.7`. The public key is added to the authorized_keys file\nof the pi user.  The password login is automatically disabled and only\nthe ssh key authentication is enabled.\n\n## Process\n\nThe process of the burn is as follows.\n\n1. start the programm with the appropriate parameters the program will\n   ask you to place an SD Card in the SD Card writer. Place it in\n2. the specified image will be burned on the SD Card\n3. next the SD Card will be mounted by the program and the appropriate\n   modifications will bbe conducted.\n4. after the modifications the SD Card will be unmounted\n5. you will be asked to remove the card\n6. if additional cards need to be burned, you will go to step 2.\n\nIn case a SD Card of a PI in the cluster goes bad, you can simply burn\nit again by providing the appropriate parameters, and just print the\nsubset that are broken.\n\n## Setting up a Single Large Cluster with cm-burn\n\n`cm-burn` will setup a simple network on all cluster nodes\nconfigured. There are different models for networking configuration we\ncould use.  However we have decided for one that allows you to\ninterface with your local Laptop to the cluster via Wifi.  The setup\nis illustrated in Figure Networking.\n\n\n![](images/network.png)\n\nFigure: Networking\n\nWe assume that you have used cm-burn to create all SD cards for the\nPi's. One of the Pi's is specially configured with the command\n\n```\ncm-burn --master red01\n```\n\nThe SD Card in the SD Card writer will be configured as a `master`. If\nthe name does not match it will be configured as a worker.  Only the\n`master` is connected with the Wifi network. All other nodes rout the\ninternet connection through the master node.  As the `master` node is\non the same Wifi network as the laptop you can login to the 'master'\nnode and from there log into the workers.  To simplify access you\ncould even setup ssh tunneled connections from the Laptop via the\nmaster. But this is left up to you if you wish.\n\nAs a result you will be able to login on each of the machines and\nexecute commands such as\n\n```\nsudo apt-get update\n```\n\nCertainly you can even have a much simpler setup by just attaching a keyboard, mouse and monitor/TV to your `master`. \nThis will allow you to directly work on the master node, not needing any additional hardware.\n\n## Setting up a Cluster of Clusters with cm-burn\n\nTo integrate the clusters into a single network, we need a switch  or combination of switches to which we connect the clusters.\nThis is depicted in the Figure Cluster of Clusters\n\n\n![](images/network-cluster.png)\n\nEach cluster is naemed cluster01-clusterNN. The hostnames are node followed by 3 zeros padded with the node number\nThere is a correlation between the cluster number and the node numbers in the following interval\n\na cluster has the nodes \n\n```\n[(clustername - 1) * 5 + 1, (clustername - 1) * 5 + 5]\n```\n\nFor convenience we will be also enabeling a cluster burn logic, that burns all images for a given cluster\n\ncm-burn --workers=5 --name=cluster --nodes=nodes --id=3\n\n![](images/pi_clusters_case.jpg)\n\n## Prerequisits\n\n### Raspberry Pi\n\nWe assume that you have set up a raspberry pi with the newest raspbian\nOS. We assume that you have changed the default password and can log\ninto the pi.\n\nWe assume you have not done anything else to the OS.\n\nThe easiest way to duplicate the SD card is simply to clone it with\nthe build in SD Card copier. This program can be found in the menu\nunder Accessories.\n\n![SD Card Copier](images/sdcc.png) \n\nFigure: SD Card Copier\n\nThis program will copy the contents of the card plugged into the PI\nonto another one. The only thing you need is an USB SD Card\nwriter. You cn accept the defaults when the cards are plugged in which\nallow you to copy the Internal SD Card onto the other one. Just be\ncarefull that you do not overwrite your internal one. This feature can\nalso be used to create backups of images that you have worked on and\nwant to preserve.\n\nThus as you can see there is not much you need to do to prepare a PI\nto be used for burning the SD Card.\n\nTODO: Python3\n\n#### Card Burning from commandline\n\n* Insert card and find mmcblk0, e.g. no letter p in it for partition\n\n```sudo ls -ltr /dev/*```\n\n\n```sudo dd bs=1M if=~/.cloudmesh/images/imagename.img of=mmcblk0 status=progress conv=fsync```\n\n\n### OSX \n\n#### Card Burning\n\nOn OSX a good program is to use etcher for burning the images on disk:\n\n* <https://etcher.io/>\n\nTo access it form the commandline you can also use\n\n* <https://etcher.io/cli/>\n\n#### File System Management\nUnfortunately, the free versions of writing the ext file system are no\nlonger supported on OSX. This means that as of writing of this document\nthe best solution we found is to purchase and install extFS on the\nMacOS computer you use for burning the SD Cards. If you find an\nalternative, please let us know. (We tested ext4fuse, which\nunfortunately only supports read access, see Appendix)\n\nTo easily read and write ext file systems, please install extFS which\ncan be downloaded from\n\n* <https://www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-mac/>\n\nThe purchase price of the software is $39.95.\n\nIf you like to not spend any money we recommend that you conduct the\nburning on a raspberry pi.\n\nTODO: PYTHON3 use pyenv\n\nTip: An alternative would be using virtualbox and using a virtual machine \nto avoid purchasing extFS.\n\n## Windows\n\n\n#### Elevate permissions for Python.exe in Windows\n\n* Create a shortcut for python.exe\n* Change the shortcut target into something like C:\\xxx\\...\\python.exe  \n* Click \"advance...\" in the property panel of the shortcut, and click\n  the option \"run as administrator\"\n\n#### Executable needed to burn the image on SD Card:\n\nDownload CommandLineDiskImager from the following url\n\n* <https://github.com/davidferguson/CommandLineDiskImager>\n\nThe above executable will be used by cm-burn script.\n\nIt's necessary to burn the raspbian image to the SD card with this executable manually or thru Etcher in order to continue with next step.\n\n```CommandLineDiskImager.exe C:\\Users\\John\\Downloads\\raspbian.img G```\n\n#### File System Management\n\nDownload the Open source ext3/4 file system driver for Windows installer from\n\n* <http://www.ext2fsd.com/>\n* Open Ext2fsd exe\n* The burned image in the previous step in SD card will have 2 partition\n* FAT32 partition will be assigned with the Drive letter - Boot Drive\n* Assign Drive Letter for EXT4 (Right click on the EXT4, \n  Assign letter.  \n  The drive letter will be used while running cm-burn) - Root Drive\n* Setting Automount of this EXT4\n* F3 or Tools->Ext2 Volume Management\n* Check-> Automatically mount via Ext2Mgr\n* The instructions above needed for the Ext2fsd to reserve the Drive Letters and any raspbian image burned to SD will be auto mounted to the specific reserved drive letters. These drive letters need to be specified while using cm-burn\n\n\n## Installation \n\n### Install on your OS\n\nOnce you have decided which Computer system (MacOS, Linux, or Windows)\nyou like to use for using the cm-burn program you need to install\nit. The program is written in python3 which we assume you have\ninstalled and is your default python in your terminal.\n\nTo install cm-burn, please execute \n```\ngit clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cm-burn.git\ncd cm-burn\npip install .\n```\n\nIn future it will also be hosted on pypi and you will be able to\ninstall it with\n\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/cloudmesh/cm-burn\n```\nTo check if the program works please issue the command\n\n```cm-burn check install```\n\nIt will check if you have installed all prerequisites and are able to\nrun the command as on some OSes you must be in the sudo list to runi\nit and access the SD card burner as well as mounting some file systems.\n\n\n### Usage\n\n#### cmburn.yaml\n\n```\ncloudmesh:\n    burn:\n       image: None\n```\n\n#### Manual page\n\n\n1. git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cm-burn\n2. cd cm-burn\n3. python setup.py install\n4.

To install it please\nuse the following steps. However it will not allow you to use the\ncm-burn program. It may be useful for inspection of SD Cards\n\nOn OSX you will need brew and install osxfuse and ext4fuse\n\n```\nbrew cask install osxfuse\nbrew install ext4fuse\n```\n\nTo run it, your account must be in the sudoers list. Than you can do the following\n\n```\nmkdir linux\nmkdir boot\ncp  ../*.img 00.img\nbrew cask install osxfuse\nbrew install ext4fuse\nhdiutil mount 00.img \n```\n\nThis will return \n```\n/dev/disk3          \tFDisk_partition_scheme         \t\n/dev/disk3s1        \tWindows_FAT_32                 \t/Volumes/boot\n/dev/disk3s2        \tLinux          \n```\n\nWe can now access the boot partition with \n\n```\nls /Volumes/boot/\n```\n\nThis partition is writable as it is not in ext format.\n\nHowever to access the Linux partition in read only form we need to mount it with fuse\n\n```\nsudo mkdir /Volumes/Linux\nsudo ext4fuse /dev/disk2s2 /Volumes/Linux -o allow_other\next4fuse /dev/disk2s2 linux\nless linux/etc/hosts\nsudo umount /Volumes/Linux \n```\n\n### Activate SSH\n\nsee method 3 in <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/>\n\nDraft:\n\nSet up ssh key on windows (use and document the ubuntu on windows thing)\n\nyou will have ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\ncopy the content of the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub into ???/.ssh/authorized_keys\n??? is the location of the admin user i think the username is pi\n\nenable ssh on the other partition while creating the fike to activate ssh\n\n### Hostname\n\nchange /etc/hostname\n\n### Activate Network\n\nsee <https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/networking-lessons/rpi-static-ip-address/>\n\n### Change default password\n\nFrom the net (wrong method):\n\nMount the SD card, go into the file system, and edit /etc/passwd. Find the line starting with \"pi\" that begins like this:\n\n```pi:x:1000:1000...```\n\nGet rid of the x; leave the colons on either side. This will eliminate the need for a password.\n\nYou probably then want to create a new password by using the passwd command after you log in.\n\nThe right thing to do is to create a new hash and store it in place of x.\nnot yet sure how that can be done a previous student from the class may have been aboe to do that \nBertholt is firstname.\n\ncould this work?

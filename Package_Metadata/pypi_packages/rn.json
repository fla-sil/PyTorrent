It should work unchanged in\r\nGNU/Linux and OS X, too, but I have not tested it.\r\n\r\nIf you own  or have access to a Mac, I would really appreciate it if you\r\nrun the test program in it and let me know the results. The same goes for any\r\nGNU/Linux system. See the test section for details.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nTo install the program:\r\n\r\n``$ pip install rn``\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nTo install the documentation you will have to download the package and untar it with your favorite program or through the console:\r\n\r\n``$ tar -xz -f rn-1.0.?.tar.gz``\r\n\r\nNow you will find, in different formats, the manual under the doc folder.\r\n\r\n**rn.1** is the manual in man format. If you are using a UNIX like system,\r\nyou can copy it to your man directory (as root) and access it anytime with\r\n``man rn``.\r\n\r\nAs root:\r\n\r\n``gzip rn.1``\r\n\r\n``cp rn.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1/``\r\n\r\nThe path to your man pages may be different.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\n- Delete any number of characters from your selection of file names starting at the beginning, at the\r\n  end or in the middle.\r\n- Crop text from the files names: words, letters, from a word to the end, from the beginning to a letter or word...\r\n- Replace letter or words inside the names of the files.\r\n- Change the capitalization or case.\r\n- Add prefixes or suffixes.\r\n- Apply all the above to directory names or file extensions.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n=======\r\n\r\nIf you have downloaded the package (and not only install it with pip), you\r\nwill have a test folder containing two archives.\r\n\r\nTo run the test, make a copy of the executable rn as rn.py in the test \r\ndirectory, change to the test directory and execute the script *test* :\r\n\r\n``$ ./test``\r\n\r\nYou have to have pytest installed.\r\n\r\nIf some error raises, please, run the test again directing the output to a \r\nfile and e-mail it to me with any details you may find important.\r\n\r\n``$ ./test > test-results-file``\r\n\r\nIf there were not errors and you are running a system different of FreeBSD or Windows XP, please let me know that the program works in your operating system, too.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\n\r\nYou may contact the author of the program at: <rn-program at mundo-r dot com>\r\n\r\nVersions\r\n========\r\n\r\n- rn-1.0.2, September 26, 2015.

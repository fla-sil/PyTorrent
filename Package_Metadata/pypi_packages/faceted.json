For example, perhaps\nyou would like to make a figure that fits exactly within a column of a\nmanuscript without any scaling, and you would like the panels to be as large as\npossible, but retain a fixed aspect ratio (height divided by width). Maybe some\n(or all) of your panels require an accompanying colorbar. With out of the box\nmatplotlib tools this is actually somewhat tricky. \n\nInternally, this module uses the flexible [`matplotlib` `AxesGrid` toolkit](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid/users/overview.html#axes-grid1),\nwith some additional logic to enable making these kinds of\ndimensionally-constrained\npanel plots with precise padding and colorbar size(s).\n\nAnother project with a similar motivation is [panel-plots](\nhttps://github.com/ajdawson/panel-plots); however it does not have support\nfor adding colorbars to a dimensionally-constrained figure.  One part of the \nimplementation there that inspired part of what is done here is the ability \nto add user-settable padding to the edges of the figure (to add space for \naxes ticks, ticklabels, and labels).  This eliminates the need for using \n`bbox_inches='tight'` when saving the figure, and enables you \nto make sure that your figures are *exactly* the dimensions you need for your\nuse.\n\nImportant links\n---------------\n- HTML documentation: https://faceted.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n- Issue tracker: https://github.com/spencerkclark/faceted/issues\n- Source code: https://github.com/spencerkclark/faceted\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/spencerkclark/faceted", "keywords": "matplotlib cartopy multi-panel plots colorbars", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "faceted", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/faceted/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/faceted/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/spencerkclark/faceted"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/faceted/0.1/", "requires_dist": ["matplotlib (>=1.5)", "numpy (>=1.7)"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Precisely spaced subplots", "version": "0.1", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>The purpose of this module is to make it easy to produce single-or-multi-panel\nfigures in matplotlib with strict dimensional constraints.

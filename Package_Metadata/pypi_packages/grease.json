The component-based architecture allows games to be constructed\r\nbit by bit with built-in separation of concerns. The engine acknowledges that\r\nall game projects are unique and have different requirements. Thus Grease does\r\nnot attempt to provide one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead it provides\r\npluggable components and systems than can be configured, adapted and extended\r\nto fits the particular needs at hand.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project include:\r\n\r\n* Making Python game development faster and more fun by allowing the developer\r\n  to focus on creating their game rather than getting bogged down in\r\n  architecture, low-level apis and adapting ill-fitting tools together.\r\n\r\n* To provide pluggable and extensible parts that implement first-class\r\n  techniques and algorithms that can be leveraged for many projects.\r\n\r\n* To fully document the engine and provide examples that demonstrate best\r\n  practices for others to base their projects on.\r\n\r\n* To facilitate outside contribution of parts and ideas into the framework\r\n  that have proven useful in the wild.\r\n\r\n* To provide optional native-code optimized parts for maximum performance,\r\n  but also provide equivalent parts coded in pure Python for ease\r\n  of installation and distribution.\r\n\r\nNot all of these goals have been realized yet, but I feel the project is well\r\non their path.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nGrease is distributed under a permissive MIT-style open source license. This\r\nlicense permits you to use grease for commercial or non-commercial purposes\r\nfree of charge.

The APIs may change in\r\nfuture releases, however efforts will be made to minimize breakage between\r\nreleases.\r\n\r\nContributing and Getting Support\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nCome visit us at the Grease users google group to get help, moral support,\r\nlavish praise, complain bitterly, report a bug, or contribute ideas:\r\n\r\n* http://groups.google.com/group/grease-users\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute to Grease, feel free to fork the git\r\nrepository and make a pull request to have your changes reviewed. Note that\r\nbug fixes must be accompanied by unit tests, and features must also be\r\ndocumented.

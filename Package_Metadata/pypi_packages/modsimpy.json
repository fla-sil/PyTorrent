It is organized in three parts:\n\n-  The first part presents discrete models, including a bikeshare system\n   and world population growth.\n\n-  The second part introduces first-order systems, including models of\n   infectious disease, thermal systems, and pharmacokinetics.\n\n-  The third part is about second-order systems, including mechanical\n   systems like projectiles, celestial mechanics, and rotating rigid\n   bodies.\n\nTaking a computational approach makes it possible to work with more\nrealistic models than what you typically see in a first-year physics\nclass, with the option to include features like friction and drag.\n\nPython is an ideal programming language for this material. It is a good\nfirst language for people who have not programmed before, and it\nprovides high-level data structures that are well-suited to express\nsolutions to the problems we are interested in.\n\n*Modeling and Simulation in Python* is a Free Book. It is available\nunder the `Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 Unported\nLicense <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/>`__, which\nmeans that you are free to copy, distribute, and modify it, as long as\nyou attribute the work and don't use it for commercial purposes.\n\n\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nTo run the examples and work on the exercises in this book, you have to:\n\n1. Install Python on your computer, along with the libraries we will\n   use.\n\n2. Copy my files onto your computer.\n\n3. Run Jupyter, which is a tool for running and writing programs, and\n   load a **notebook**, which is a file that contains code and text.\n\nThe next three sections provide details for these steps. I wish there\nwere an easier way to get started; it's regrettable that you have to do\nso much work before you write your first program. Be persistent!\n\nInstalling Python\n-----------------\n\nYou might already have Python installed on your computer, but you might\nnot have the latest version. To use the code in this book, you need\nPython 3.6 or later. Even if you have the latest version, you probably\ndon't have all of the libraries we need.\n\nYou could update Python and install these libraries, but I strongly\nrecommend that you don't go down that road. I think you will find it\neasier to use **Anaconda**, which is a free Python distribution that\nincludes all the libraries you need for this book (and more).\n\nAnaconda is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. By default, it puts\nall files in your home directory, so you don't need administrator (root)\npermission to install it, and if you have a version of Python already,\nAnaconda will not remove or modify it.\n\nStart at `the Anaconda download\npage <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section>`__.\nDownload the installer for your system and run it. You don't need\nadministrative privileges to install Anaconda, so I recommend you run\nthe installer as a normal user, not as administrator or root.\n\nI suggest you accept the recommended options. On Windows you have the\noption to install Visual Studio Code, which is an interactive\nenvironment for writing programs. You won't need it for this book, but\nyou might want it for other projects.\n\nBy default, Anaconda installs most of the packages you need, but there\nare a few more you have to add. Once the installation is complete, open\na command window. On macOS or Linux, you can use Terminal. On Windows,\nopen the Anaconda Prompt that should be in your Start menu.\n\nRun the following command (copy and paste it if you can, to avoid\ntypos):\n\n::\n\n   conda install jupyterlab pandas seaborn sympy beautifulsoup4 lxml html5lib pytables\n\nTo install Pint, run this command:\n\n::\n\n   conda install -c unidata pint\n\nAnd to install the ModSim library, run this command:\n\n::\n\n   pip install modsim\n\nThat should be everything you need.\n\nCopying my files\n----------------\n\nThe simplest way to get the files for this book is to download a `Zip\narchive from\nGitHub <https://github.com/AllenDowney/ModSimPy/archive/master.zip>`__.\nYou will need a program like WinZip or gzip to unpack the Zip file. Make\na note of the location of the files you download.\n\nIf you download the Zip file, you can skip the rest of this section,\nwhich explains how to use Git.\n\nThe code for this book is available from\nhttps://github.com/AllenDowney/ModSimPy, which is a **Git repository**.\nGit is a software tool that helps you keep track of the programs and\nother files that make up a project. A collection of files under Git's\ncontrol is called a repository (the cool kids call it a \"repo\"). GitHub\nis a hosting service that provides storage for Git repositories and a\nconvenient web interface.\n\nBefore you download these files, I suggest you copy my repository on\nGitHub, which is called **forking**. If you don't already have a GitHub\naccount, you'll need to create one.\n\nUse a browser to view the homepage of my repository at\nhttps://github.com/AllenDowney/ModSimPy. You should see a gray button in\nthe upper right that says Fork. If you press it, GitHub will create a\ncopy of my repository that belongs to you.\n\nNow, the best way to download the files is to use a **Git client**,\nwhich is a program that manages git repositories. You can get\ninstallation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux at\nhttp://modsimpy.com/getgit.\n\nIn Windows, I suggest you accept the options recommended by the\ninstaller, with two exceptions:\n\n-  As the default editor, choose instead of .\n\n-  For \"Configuring line ending conversions\", select \"Check out as is,\n   commit as is\".\n\nFor macOS and Linux, I suggest you accept the recommended options.\n\nOnce the installation is complete, open a command window. On Windows,\nopen Git Bash, which should be in your Start menu. On macOS or Linux,\nyou can use Terminal.\n\nTo find out what directory you are in, type \"pwd\", which stands for \"print\nworking directory\". On Windows, most likely you are in . On MacOS or\nLinux, you are probably in your home directory, .\n\nThe next step is to copy files from your repository on GitHub to your\ncomputer; in Git vocabulary, this process is called **cloning**. Run\nthis command:\n\n::\n\n   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUserName/ModSimPy\n\nOf course, you should replace with your GitHub user name. After cloning,\nyou should have a new directory called .\n\nRunning Jupyter\n---------------\n\nThe code for each chapter, and starter code for the exercises, is in\nJupyter notebooks. If you have not used Jupyter before, you can read\nabout it at https://jupyter.org.\n\nTo start Jupyter on macOS or Linux, open a Terminal; on Windows, open\nGit Bash. Use \"cd\" to change directory into the code directory in the\nrepository:\n\n::\n\n   cd ModSimPy/code\n\nThen launch the Jupyter notebook server:\n\n::\n\n   jupyter notebook\n\nJupyter should open a window in a browser, and you should see the list\nof notebooks in my repository. Click on the first notebook, and follow\nthe instructions to run the first few \"cells\". The first time you run a\nnotebook, it might take several seconds to start, while some Python\nfiles get initialized. After that, it should run faster.\n\nFeel free to read through the notebook, but it might not make sense\nuntil you read Chapter 1.\n\nYou can also launch Jupyter from the Start menu on Windows, the Dock on\nmacOS, or the Anaconda Navigator on any system. If you do that, Jupyter\nmight start in your home directory or somewhere else in your file\nsystem, so you might have to navigate to find the directory.\n\n.. |Binder| image:: https://mybinder.org/badge.svg\n   :target: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AllenDowney/ModSimPy/master?filepath=notebooks", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://github.com/AllenDowney/ModSimPy", "keywords": "", "license": "LICENSE", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "modsimpy", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/modsimpy/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/modsimpy/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "http://github.com/AllenDowney/ModSimPy"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/modsimpy/1.1.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Python library for the book Modeling and Simulation in Python.", "version": "1.1.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <p>Supporting code for Modeling and Simulation in Python.  <a href=\"http://greenteapress.com/wp/modsimpy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> and other Free Books by\nAllen Downey are available from <a href=\"http://greenteapress.com/wp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Tea\nPress</a>.</p>\n<p>You can run the code from the repository in a browser by pressing the\nBinder button below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AllenDowney/ModSimPy/master?filepath=notebooks\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Binder\" src=\"https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/86eb116bc9e98bea90d9454762d384d9cae5055c/68747470733a2f2f6d7962696e6465722e6f72672f62616467652e737667\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Modeling and Simulation in Python</em> is an introduction to physical\nmodeling using a computational approach.

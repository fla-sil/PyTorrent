If you are unable to get your questions answered\nthere, or are interested in helping develop the product, see the credits below\nfor individuals you might contact.\n\nOverview\n========\n\nUsing Plone's Archetypes system and archetypes.schemaextender, the RSVP for\nSalesforce add-on product enables a mechanism for \"marking\" pieces of content\nas eligible to accept RSVPs (i.e. registrations) from site visitors. The act of\n\"marking\" content extends the existing piece of content with several additional\nfields for custom RSVP behaviors.\n\nHowever, this is not a generic RSVP/registration system, but as the name\nsuggests, is optimized to work with the Salesforce.com Customer Relationship\nManagement system, which is a generic system that can be used to manage Leads,\nContacts, Campaigns, and Events. By default, registrants are stored as Lead\nobjects with an associated CampaignMember object serving as the \"junction\"\nbetween an organization's configured \"Campaign\" and those interested in\nparticipating. This can be useful in cases of in person and/or virtual events\n(i.e. a training, a conference, a political rally, etc.) and online campaigns\nallowing participant sign-on (signature drives, pledge drives, etc.). The\ndefault behavior of creating a Lead and CampaignMember associated with the\nconfigured Campaign can be fully customized with the optional add-on Plone\nproducts PloneFormGen (and dependencies) and Salesforce PFG Adapter.\n\nFeatures of RSVP for Salesforce include:\n\n  - Complete integration with the robust and powerful CRM system \n    Salesforce.com\n  \n  - Ability to mark and configure any Archetypes content object as RSVP-aware\n  \n  - Default registration form requiring minimal attendee information and \n    completely free of complex configuration demands.\n  \n  - Optional maximum capacity for RSVP-enabled activities\n  \n  - Optional acceptance of \"waitlist\" registrations in the event of \n    cancellations\n  \n  - Optional expiration date for the automatic disabling of RSVP\n  \n  - Ability to model \"first come first served\" or \"apply for acceptance after \n    further consideration\" type events.  This can be done by setting the \n    default signup \"status\" from within Salesforce.com for the RSVP-enabled \n    event (i.e. the status for a newly created CampaignMember could be \"sent\", \n    \"applied\", \"responded\", etc. depending upon how event attendance is \n    modeled in each case.\n  \n  - Optional Add-on Capability: Using PloneFormGen with Salesforce PFG Adapter \n    create enhanced and completely customizable registration forms requesting \n    and/or requiring arbitrary sign-up data that can be mapped to arbitrary \n    Salesforce.com objects.  The referring \"RSVP\" accepting Salesforce.com \n    object id is passed to the custom form for appropriate association.\n\n\nWhat this isn't...\n==================\n... and may or may not ever be:\n\n  - A general, feature complete ticketing, online registration system.  This is  \n    simple and optimized to integrate well with Salesforce.com and is optimized \n    towards events with a flexible amount of capacity. While one can certainly \n    use this to lock down capacity a bit more tightly, the burden is upon a \n    correct configuration of the capacity related fields.\n\n  - A system for accepting online payment to secure event attendance -- though \n    we're placing bets internally on how long it will be until this feature is \n    requested.\n\n  - A fail safe system for absolutely capping attendance at a hard capacity.  \n    Because a greater than max capacity # of participants could load a custom \n    PloneFormGen-based registration form (or the default registration form for \n    that matter) that suggests available capacity, we advise you to set \n    expectations appropriately during the signup process and via any \n    auto-response emails that are sent.  In other words, text like the \n    following goes a long way towards expectation management: \"Thanks for \n    expressing your interest in attending our event. A follow-up email will be \n    sent within 24 hours confirming your space for the event.\"\n\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n============\n\nRSVP for Salesforce requires Plone 3.0 or greater.\n\nThe following dependencies should be pulled in automatically when you install\nthe egg:\n\n  * beatbox >= 0.9.1.1\n  * Products.salesforcebaseconnector >= 1.0\n  * archetypes.schemaextender\n\nIf you want to use custom PloneFormGen-based registration forms, then you must\nhave PloneFormGen >= 1.5b2.\n\nCONFIGURATION TIPS\n==================\n\nQ: But I only want content type X or Y (i.e. Event objects) to be configured as RSVP-aware...\n  A: To limit which content types the user can easily configure as RSVP-aware, the \n  condition_expr for the \"allowRSVPs\" and \"disableRSVPs\" actions, could be changed to something \n  like (replace 'Event' with the name(s) of your preferred content type below)::\n\n    condition_expr=\"python:not object.restrictedTraverse('@@rsvp-configuration').isRSVPEnabled() and object.portal_type in ('Event',) \"\n\n\nQ: How can I customize the registration form and messages?\n  A: You can configure a PloneFormGen form as a custom registration form.  In this case RSVP for\n  Salesforce displays the form and checks for whether capacity has been reached, but does not\n  actually handle the management of records in Salesforce.com.  To achieve that with a custom\n  registration form, use the Salesforce PFG Adapter (Products.salesforcepfgadapter).  In a typical\n  use case, you might use two PFG adapters to create a Contact and a CampaignMember object linking\n  that contact to a particular campaign.\n  \n  Note: This requires PloneFormGen >= 1.5b2.\n\n  RSVP for Salesforce will pass the configured Salesforce object (typically a Campaign) to the form\n  in the 'signup-object-id' variable of the request, so that it is possible to optionally use the\n  same registration form to register people for multiple campaigns.  For instance, you might create\n  a 'CampaignID' string field in the PloneFormGen form with the server-side only flag set (so that\n  the field doesn't render) and with a default value override like\n  python:request.get('signup-object-id', ''), and map this field to the Salesforce CampaignID field\n  via the salesforcepfgadapter edit screen.\n\n  If you need to modify the messages regarding waitlist status and successful registration,\n  the best approach is to override the rsvp.register viewlet on a theme-specific browser layer.\n  The ZMCL to do so might look something like this::\n\n    <browser:viewlet\n        name=\"rsvp.register\"\n        for=\"collective.salesforce.rsvp.interfaces.ISalesforceRSVPable\"\n        manager=\"plone.app.layout.viewlets.interfaces.IBelowContentBody\"\n        class=\"collective.salesforce.rsvp.registration.RegistrationViewlet\"\n        template=\"path/to/my_custom_template.pt\"\n        allowed_interface=\"collective.salesforce.rsvp.interfaces.IRegistrationViewlet\"\n        permission=\"zope2.View\"\n        layer=\"myproduct.interfaces.IThemeSpecific\"\n        />\n\n  where my_custom_template.pt would be a modified copy of browser/templates/registration-viewlet.pt\n  from this package.\n\nCredits\n=======\nThe Plone & Salesforce crew in Seattle and Portland:\n\n- Jon Baldivieso <jonb --AT-- onenw --DOT-- org>\n- Andrew Burkhalter <andrewburkhalter --AT-- gmail --DOT-- com>\n- Brian Gershon <briang --AT-- webcollective --DOT-- coop>\n- David Glick <davidglick --AT-- onenw --DOT-- org> \n- Jesse Snyder <jesses --AT-- npowerseattle --DOT-- org>\n\nSalesforce.com Foundation and Enfold Systems for their gift and work on beatbox\nand the original proof of concept code that has become Salesforce Auth Plugin (see: \nhttp://gokubi.com/archives/onenorthwest-gets-grant-from-salesforcecom-to-integrate-with-plone)\n\nCHANGELOG\n=========\n\n1.3 (2010-10-04)\n----------------\n\n- Fix issue with extended characters in form prologue/epilogue.\n  [davisagli]\n\n1.2 (2010-06-01)\n----------------\n\n- Keep the custom registration form reference when RSVPable items are\n  copied.

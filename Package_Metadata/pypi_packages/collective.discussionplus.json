It attempts to keep as much of the existing commenting\nmachinery as possible, but adds the following features:\n\nEvents:\n\n * An `IObjectAddedEvent` is fired when a discussion item (described by the\n   interface `Products.CMFCore.interfaces.IDiscussionResponse`) is created.\n * Similarly, an `IObjectRemovedEvent` is fired when a discussion item is\n   deleted.\n \nIndexing:\n \n * Content items gain two additional catalogue indexes: `number_of_comments`,\n   which contains the number of comments left on a content item, and\n   `commentators`, which contains a list of unique usernames of those who\n   have left one or more comments on the content item. `number_of_comments`\n   is also available as catalogue metadata.\n * Collections are configured so that it is possible to search by these \n   indexes. For example, the 'Current author' criterion can be used to list\n   all content items upon which the current user has left a comment.\n * Discussion items gain an additional catalogue metadata column, \n   `comment_subject`, which contains the title of the content item that was\n   commented upon (note that this is not updated if the content item changes\n   title).\n \nWorkflow:\n \n * Discussion items will respect the workflow set in portal_workflow. By\n   default, the `one_state_workflow` is used, which means a comment is\n   always published. An additional `comment_review_workflow` is installed,\n   which has two states: `pending` and `published`. Comments may either be\n   published or deleted.\n * A new view, @@review-comments, is available for any folder or the portal\n   root. This allows site-wide (or folder-wide) moderation of comments, with\n   quick publish/delete operations.\n   \nNote that the @@review-comments view makes a few assumptions:\n\n * Comments pending review are always in the `pending` state. You can add\n   a `review_state` request parameter to specify a different state to search\n   for, however.\n * There is a transition called `publish` to move a comment from `pending` to\n   `published`. You can request a different transition by providing a\n   request parameter `publish_transition`.\n\nFurthermore:\n\n  * The `number_of_comments` index will only include comments in the\n    `published` state.\n  * Neither the `portal_catalog` `Clear and rebuild`, nor the \n    `portal_workflow` `Update security settings` operation will correctly\n    find and update comments, due to the way that comments are stored.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nThis product requires Plone 3.3+ (and will likely not work with Plone 4). In\nparticular, it relies on `plone.indexer`, which is part of Plone 3.3+.\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.0b2 - 2009-04-17\n------------------\n\n* Catch up to Plone 3.3", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.discussionplus", "keywords": "plone discussion commenting", "license": "GPL", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "collective.discussionplus", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/collective.discussionplus/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/collective.discussionplus/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.discussionplus"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/collective.discussionplus/1.0b2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Augments the standard Plone discussion tool to add basic approvals workflow, and ibetter indexing of comment metadata (number of comments, who has commented?)", "version": "1.0b2", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"introduction\">\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>This package provides some enhancements to Plone\u2019s standard commenting\nfunctionality.

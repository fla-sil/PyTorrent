We're still working on the code!)\n\n- Has multiple basis sets for the underlying PSF model, including pixel-based,\n  shapelets, Gaussian mixture, maybe also Moffat and/or Kolmogorov.\n- Can build the models in either chip or sky coordinates, properly accounting\n  for the WCS of the image.\n- Can interpolate across the full field-of-view, or across each chip separately,\n  or a combination of both.\n- Can do the fitting in either real or Fourier space.\n- Has multiple interpolation functions including polynomials, gaussian processes,\n  and others.\n- Can take knowledge of the optical aberrations as input to convolve the model\n  of the atmospheric PSF.\n- Performs outlier rejection to detect and remove stars that are not good\n  exemplars of the PSF.  Outputs the list of stars that were actually used\n  to build the final model.\n- Allows the centroid to be fixed or floating.\n- In general, allow any value to be fixed rather than fit for.\n- Uses highly readable YAML configuration files to set the various options.\n- Includes Python code to read in the PSF files and use it to draw an image\n  of the PSF at an arbitrary location.\n- Currently, the lead developers are:\n  - Mike Jarvis (mikejarvis17 at gmail)\n  - Josh Meyers (jmeyers314 at gmail)\n  - Pierre-Francois Leget (leget at stanford)\n  - Chris Davis (chris.pa.davis at gmail)\n  If you'd like to join the development effort, or if you have any other\n  questions or comments about the code, feel free to contact us at the above\n  email addresses.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe easiest way to install Piff is with pip::\n\n    pip install piff\n\nIf you have previously installed Piff and want to uprade to a new released version,\nyou should do::\n\n    pip install piff --upgrade\n\nDepending on the write permissions of the python distribution for your specific\nsystem, you might need to use one of the following variants::\n\n    sudo pip install piff\n    pip install piff --user\n\nThe latter installs the Python module into ``~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages``,\nwhich is normally already in your PYTHONPATH, but it puts the executables\n``piffify`` and ``meanify`` into ``~/.local/bin`` which is probably not in your PATH.\nTo use these scripts, you should add this directory to your PATH.  If you would\nrather install into a different prefix rather than ~/.local, you can use::\n\n    pip install piff --install-option=\"--prefix=PREFIX\"\n\nThis would install the executables into ``PREFIX/bin`` and the Python module\ninto ``PREFIX/lib/python3.7/site-packages``.\n\nIf you need the bleeding edge version on master, you can download or clone\nthe repo and install with::\n\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    python setup.py install\n\nDepending on your setup, you might prefer/need one of these variants::\n\n    sudo python setup.py install\n    python setup.py install --user\n    python setup.py install --prefix=PREFIX\n\n\nRunning Tests\n-------------\n\nAfter installing Piff, you can run the unit tests by doing::\n\n    cd tests\n    nosetests\n\n\nReporting bugs\n--------------\n\nIf you have any trouble installing or using the code, or if you find a bug,\nplease report it at:\n\nhttps://github.com/rmjarvis/Piff/issues\n\nClick \"New Issue\", which will open up a form for you to fill in with the\ndetails of the problem you are having.\n\n\nRequesting features\n-------------------\n\nIf you would like to request a new feature, do the same thing.  Open a new\nissue and fill in the details of the feature you would like added to Piff.\nOr if there is already an issue for your desired feature, please add to the\ndiscussion, describing your use case.

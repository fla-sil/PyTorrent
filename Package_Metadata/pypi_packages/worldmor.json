The game can also be played in fullscreen mode.\nThere are three levels of difficulty that are specified by enemy surveillance and their speed.\n\nInstallation\n-------------\n\n- Game is released on `Pypi`_.\n- This game can be install using pip.\n- Use following command: ``python -m pip install worldmor``\n\nControl and aim of the game\n-----------------------------\n\nYou can use WSAD or arrows to walk, and you can use Spacebar or 0 to shoot.\nThe body always shoots in the direction of movement.\n\nThe goal of the game is to destroy the enemy,\nafter each destroyed extra-emblem, there is blood on the map that points,\nbut the attention need not be collected by you alone.\nThe game ends after you've been killed.\nThe number of objects on the map drops to a minimum and the number of\nenemies increases with the distance from start, which will soon bring about an end.\n\nSemestral work assignment\n----------------------------\n\nThe work aims to create a game that will take place on a 2D endless map.\nYour aim of the game will be to get the highest score.\n\nThe map itself is endless. Visibility is limited.\nThe map finds aliens (opponents) controlled by some artificial intelligence (more likely to settle the difficulty).\nTheir goal is your destruction of course, but they have more primitive weapons than you can find.\n\nThe score can be obtained for the destruction of computer opponents.\nSome bonuses can also be placed on the map, where you can get points and\nweapons which can help you destroy computer opponents.\n\nWeapons will have a different range of damage which they can cause.\nAlso, weapons will have a range. With the use of weapons, it is clear\nthat everyone on the map will have his own life. This can be supplemented by some pharmacies.\n\nWith increasing time, the game will become more and more difficult,\nthe number of opponents will increase, and the number of weapons, pharmacies on the map will decreasing.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n- Fullscreen mode\n- The ability to save and load a saved game\n- Increasing skill on an endless map\n- Several levels of enemy intelligence\n- Some different types of weapons\n\n\nBuild from repository\n-----------------------\n\nFor editing and local use, it is also possible to download this repository and to bring the game directly from it.\nTry following commands:\n\n1. Clone **WorldMor** from `repository`_.\n2. Go into the cloned directory.\n3. Run ``python -m pip install -r requirements.txt``\n4. Use the following command to build Cython code for your system: ``python setup.py develop``\n5. Now you can run game using ``python -m worldmor``\n\n\nDocumentation\n--------------\n\nThe documentation are build using `ReadTheDocs`_\nand you can find it at `WorldMorDoc`_\n\nAlso the documentation can build using the following steps:\n\n1. Clone **WorldMor** from `repository`_.\n2. Go into the cloned directory.\n3. Run ``python -m pip install -r requirements.txt``\n4. Use the following command to build Cython code for your system: ``python setup.py develop``\n5. Go to **docs** directory inside the **WorldMor**.\n6. Run ``make html``\n7.

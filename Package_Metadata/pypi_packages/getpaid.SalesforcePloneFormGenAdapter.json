In particular,\nthe \"Overview\" and \"Rationale For This Product\" sections are recommended.\n\n.. _PloneFormGen: http://plone.org/products/ploneformgen\n\nIn addition if you are unfamiliar with Salesforce please see salesfoce.com. \nFor more information about Salesforce base Connector and Salesforce PloneFormGen \nAdapter please see http://plone.org/products/salesforcebaseconnector/releases/1.0.1 \nand http://plone.org/products/salesforcepfgadapter.\n\nOnce you've setup a suitable PloneFormGen form folder (and correctly\ninstalled and configured the PloneFormGen GetPaid Salesforce Adapter \nits dependencies), you'll have the option of adding a new action adapter called a\n\"GetPaid Salesforce Adapter\".\n\nOnce you've added a GetPaid Salesforce Adapter to your form, you're presented with \nboth \"default\" and \"field mapping\" (in addition to the standard \"overrides\") \nmanagement screens for editing the adapter. The default screen consists of a \ndrop-down menu populated with all the sObject types (i.e. Salesforce Objects) \nfound in the Salesforce.com instance that corresponds to the credentials\nentered when creating a Salesforce Base Connector in the ZMI. This should \ninclude both standard and custom sObjects. \n \nOnce you've chosen your sObject type, moving through to the \"field mapping\"\nmanagement screen will display two seperate sets of two-column forms.  \nEach for setting which Salesforce field will be populated by a field on \neither your form, or from data supplied by GetPaid. Each field is\nrepresented by a single row, with the field name in the left column, and a\ndrop-down selection menu of all available Salesforce fields on the right. \nSelect the desired Salesforce field for each field and click \"Save\". \n \n# Add section talking about creating an object per line item\n\n# Probably want to explaing the difference between line item cost and total cost\n\nNB: While it is not required to map every form field to a Salesforce field,\nyou will want to make sure that all the sObject fields defined as required\nfields in your Salesforce configuration *do* have a mapping.  Otherwise, the\nsObject will not be succesfully created on submission of the form.  All required\nfields for your chosen sObject should be marked accordingly and appear at the\ntop of the list of options.\n\nShould you go back and switch to a different sObject type after having provided\na  mapping at any time, you'll want to recreate your desired mapping.  This is\nintended behavior, since the update would fail (or worse, produce very\nconfusing results) if the previously selected sObject type's mapping were\nmaintained.\n\nRationale For This Product\n==========================\n\nUsing the wonderful foundation that is provided by PloneFormGen, PloneGetPaid\n(and Plone for that matter), the task of creating a form that collects and \nvalidates some desired information, then integrates with third party payment \nprocessors to collect funds associated with the information is no longer a \ntask that requires developer intervention. Now this can be done by the any \ncontent editor with a decent grasp of the Plone user interface.  Having this \ndata inside the CMS or emailed is only of limited use however. \n\nSalesforce.com provides an extensible, powerful platform from which\nto do Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tasks ranging from sales,\nmarketing, nonprofit constituent organizing, and customer service. The\nSalesforce PFG Adapter symbolizes the pragmatic joining of a best of breed CMS\nand CRM so that each can focus on its own strengths in a way that is easy for\nnon-developers to use.\n\nSalesforce.com offers functionality called web-to-lead, but aside from \nPloneFormGen's many strengths over the web-to-lead form builder this software \noffers the following additional features:\n\n- Configurable validation of individual form fields\n- Ability to create as many different records as you'd like from the results \n  of one form\n- Ability to create custom sObject records with your form\n- Ability to create whichever type of sObject records, whereas web-to-lead\n  creates a Lead record, which can only be converted to a Contact, Account, or\n  Opportunity record. Want to directly create a Campaign record from a form?  \n  That's fine.\n\n\nDependencies\n============\n\nDepends upon the beatbox library >= 0.9.1.1, which is a Python wrapper to the\nSalesforce.com API (version 7.0).  You must have a Salesforce.com account\nthat provides API access.\n\nTo download and install beatbox, please visit::\n\n http://code.google.com/p/salesforce-beatbox/\n\nSee dependencies for PloneFormGen 1.2.x+.  As a pre-requisite, all of these must \nbe met in order to use the PloneFormGen GetPaid Salesforce Adapter.\n\nSalesforcePFGAdapter see\nhttp://plone.org/products/salesforcepfgadapter\n\nSalesforceBaseConnector >= 1.0a3. See \nhttp://plone.org/products/salesforcebaseconnector\n\nDataGridField >= 1.6.x.  Earlier versions didn't properly disable \nDataGridField's add row feature, which is important in our case because the \nuser can't add new possible form fields for mapping from within the Salesforce\nAdapter.  Those need to be added to the form itself.\n \nInstallation\n============\n#\n# Todo update section\n#\n\nTypical for a Zope/Plone product:\n\n* Install and *configure* dependencies (includes beatbox setup and creation of\n  Salesforce Base Connector with credentials in the root of the Plone site.)\n\n* Unpack the product package into the Products folder of the Zope/Plone \n  instance. Check your ownership and permissions.\n\n* Restart Zope.\n\n* Go to the Site Setup page in the Plone interface and click on the Add/Remove\n  Products link. Choose salesforcepfgadapter (check its checkbox) and click the \n  Install button. If not done already, this will install PloneFormGen in \n  addition to the salesforcepfgadapter.  If PloneFormGen is not available on the \n  Add/Remove Products list, it usually means that the product did not load due \n  to missing prerequisites.\n\nPermissions\n===========\n\nSee Permissions section of README.txt within PloneFormGen.\n\nSecurity\n========\n\nSee Security section of README.txt within PloneFormGen.\n\nKnown Problems\n==============\n\nCredits\n=======\n\n- Rob LaRubbio <rob --AT-- onenw --DOT-- org>\n\nThe Plone & Salesforce crew in Seattle and Portland for their work on\nSalesforce PFG Adapter:\n\n- Jon Baldivieso <jonb --AT-- onenw --DOT-- org>\n- Andrew Burkhalter <andrewb --AT-- onenw --DOT-- org>\n- Brian Gershon <briang --AT-- webcollective --DOT-- coop>\n- David Glick <davidglick --AT-- onenw --DOT-- org> \n- Jesse Snyder <jesses --AT-- npowerseattle --DOT-- org>\n\nWith special PloneFormGen guest star:\n\n- Steve McMahon <steve@dcn.org> \n\nJesse Snyder and NPower Seattle for the foundation of code that has become\nSalesforce Base Connector\n \nSimon Fell for providing the beatbox Python wrapper to the Salesforce.com API\n \nSalesforce.com Foundation and Enfold Systems for their gift and work on \nbeatbox (see: http://gokubi.com/archives/onenorthwest-gets-grant-from-salesforcecom-to-integrate-with-plone)\n\nSee the CHANGES.txt file for the growing list of people who helped\nwith particular features or bugs.\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nDistributed under the GPL.\n\nSee LICENSE.txt and LICENSE.GPL for details.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://code.google.com/p/getpaid", "keywords": "Zope CMF Plone Salesforce.com CRM PloneFormGen forms integration", "license": "GPL", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "getpaid.SalesforcePloneFormGenAdapter", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/getpaid.SalesforcePloneFormGenAdapter/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/getpaid.SalesforcePloneFormGenAdapter/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "http://code.google.com/p/getpaid"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/getpaid.SalesforcePloneFormGenAdapter/1.7/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "PloneFormGen adapter allowing for creation of arbitrary Salesforce.com         records based on data collected from a web form", "version": "1.7", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <div id=\"ploneformgen-getpaid-salesforce-adapter\">\n<h2>PloneFormGen GetPaid Salesforce Adapter</h2>\n<p>#\n# This section needs to be updated once the final home is decided on\n#</p>\n<p>Product home is\n<a href=\"http://plone.org/products/salesforcepfgadapter\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://plone.org/products/salesforcepfgadapter</a>.\nA <a href=\"http://plone.org/documentation/manual/integrating-plone-with-salesforce.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">documentation area</a> and <a href=\"http://plone.org/products/salesforcepfgadapter/issues\" rel=\"nofollow\">issue tracker</a> are available at the linked locations.</p>\n<p>A Google Group, called <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/plonesf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plone Salesforce Integration</a>\nexists with the sole aim of discussing and developing tools to make Plone integrate well\nwith Salesforce.com.

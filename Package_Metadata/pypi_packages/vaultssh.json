In environments which have configured Vault as a trusted CA and use it to issue signed keys for authenticating against SSH servers, this tool provides a simple wrapper which handles all the backend communication and produces a signed public key ready for the end-user to authenticate with.\n\nThis tool assumes that your Vault environment has been properly configured for signing SSH keys. Hashicorp provides extensive documentation along with examples on how to perform this configuration [in their docs](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ssh/signed-ssh-certificates/).\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\npip install vaultssh\n```\n\n## Usage example\n\nVaultSSH takes two arguments: a path to the public SSH key to sign and the [Vault role](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/identity-access-management/iam-policies) that should be used to sign it. Please refer to the [Vault documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ssh/signed-ssh-certificates/) to learn more about configuring SSH key signing. \n\n```sh\n$ vaultssh ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub myrole\n```\n\nVaultSSH will automatically detect if you had previously authenticated with the Vault server by looking for an existing token in the default Vault environment variable (`VAULT_TOKEN`) or Vault token file (~/.vault-token). You can override this behavior and provide your own token by passing the --token flag. If a token is not found, or has expired, the tool will prompt you to authenticate with the Vault backend to fetch a new token (Note: only RADIUS is currently supported). By default the tool will persist the newly acquired token in the Vault token file, however this can be disabled by passing the --no-persist flag.\n\nVaultSSH will automatically detect the location of the Vault server by using the default Vault environment variable (`VAULT_ADDR`). You can override this behavior by passing the --server flag.\n\n```sh\n$ vaultssh --server https://myvault.com:8200 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub myrole\n```\n\nIf the signing process succeeds, VaultSSH will automatically write the signed certificate to the same directory as the given public key:\n\n```sh\n$ vaultssh ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub myrole\nSigned key saved to /home/josh/.ssh/id_rsa-cert.pub\n```\n\n## Development setup\n\nThis project was developed using Pipenv as the virtual environment wrapper. To install all dependencies, run the following command at the root of the project:\n\n```sh\npipenv install --dev\n```\n\n## Release History\n\n* 0.1.0\n    * Initial prototype\n\n## Meta\n\nJoshua Gilman \u2013 joshuagilman@gmail.com\n\nDistributed under the MIT license.

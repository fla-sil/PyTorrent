The data is\noutput as CSV values and represents a varying set of use-cases.\n\nCOMMON USE CASES\n\n1. Entering data in a UI that requires a field which captures product information as CSV values, indicators or numbers.\n2. ETL applications where CSV data is needed to test ETL application processes.\n3. Database applications, where CSV data is needed to test automation of inserts and database constraints.\n4. Spreadsheet applications to test automated spreadsheet imports and external queries common in spreadsheets.\n5. Any use-case where you don't have access to a database but need data-sets to test your code.\n6. Any import-export automation process which requires output files in CSV format for testing.\n\nPossible Examples\n\n1. A website where users are required to enter defective product identifiers in CSV format for return processing.\n2. A database application that bulk processes delivery addresses.\n3. A ETL application responsible for scrubbing data and removing duplicate items or addresses.\n4. Testing of applications that require minimum and maximum field lengths.\n\n\nAbout Data\n==========\n\n\nThis application contains compiled data as the basis for generating output data.

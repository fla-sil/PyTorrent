Also it allows automatic saving of best model and logging of all training outputs for easy aftermath analysis.\n\n---\n### Install\n\nFirst you need to install [theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano)\n\nThen install mozi via pip for bleeding edge version\n```bash\nsudo pip install git+https://github.com/hycis/Mozi.git@master\n```\nor simply clone and add to `PYTHONPATH`.\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/hycis/Mozi.git\nexport PYTHONPATH=/path/to/Mozi:$PYTHONPATH\n```\nin order for the install to persist via export `PYTHONPATH`. Add `PYTHONPATH=/path/to/TensorGraph:$PYTHONPATH` to your `.bashrc` for linux or\n`.bash_profile` for mac. While this method works, you will have to ensure that\nall the dependencies in [setup.py](setup.py) are installed.\n\n---\n### Set Environment\nIn Mozi, we need to set three environment paths\n* *MOZI_DATA_PATH*\n* *MOZI_SAVE_PATH*\n* *MOZI_DATABASE_PATH*\n\n`MOZI_DATA_PATH` is the directory for saving and loading the datasets.  \n`MOZI_SAVE_PATH` is the directory for saving all the models, the output log and epoch error.  \n`MOZI_DATABASE_PATH` is the directory for saving the database that contains tables recording the hyperparameters and test errors for each training job.\n\n---\n### Let's Have Fun!\nBuilding a model in Mozi is as simple as\n\n```python\nimport theano.tensor as T\nfrom mozi.model import Sequential\nmodel = Sequential(input_var=T.matrix(), output_var=T.matrix())\n```\nThe `input_var` is the input tensor variable that corresponds to the number of dimensions of the input dataset. The `output_var` is the tensor variable that corresponds to the target of the dataset. `T.matrix` for `2d data`, `T.tensor3` for `3d data` and `T.tensor4` for `4d data`. Next add the layers\n\n```python\nfrom mozi.layers.linear import Linear\nfrom mozi.layers.activation import RELU, Softmax\nfrom mozi.layers.noise import Dropout\n\nmodel.add(Linear(prev_dim=28*28, this_dim=200))\nmodel.add(RELU())\nmodel.add(Linear(prev_dim=200, this_dim=100))\nmodel.add(RELU())\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.5))\nmodel.add(Linear(prev_dim=100, this_dim=10))\nmodel.add(Softmax())\n```\nTo train the model, first build a dataset and a learning method, here we use the mnist dataset and SGD\n```python\nfrom mozi.datasets.mnist import Mnist\nfrom mozi.learning_method import SGD\n\ndata = Mnist(batch_size=64, train_valid_test_ratio=[5,1,1])\nlearning_method = SGD(learning_rate=0.1, momentum=0.9, lr_decay_factor=0.9, decay_batch=10000)\n```\nFinally build a training object and put everything in to train the model\n```python\nfrom mozi.train_object import TrainObject\nfrom mozi.cost import mse, error\n\ntrain_object = TrainObject(model = model,\n                           log = None,\n                           dataset = data,\n                           train_cost = mse,\n                           valid_cost = error,\n                           learning_method = learning_method,\n                           stop_criteria = {'max_epoch' : 10,\n                                            'epoch_look_back' : 5,\n                                            'percent_decrease' : 0.01}\n                           )\ntrain_object.setup()\ntrain_object.run()\n```\n#### Stopping Criteria\n```python\nstop_criteria = {'max_epoch' : 10,\n                 'epoch_look_back' : 5,\n                 'percent_decrease' : 0.01}\n```\nThe stopping criteria here means the training will stop if training has reach 'max_epoch' of 10 or the validation error does not decrease by at least 1% in the past 5 epoch.\n#### Test Model\nAnd that's it! Once the training is done, to test the model, it's as simple as calling the forward propagation `fprop(X)` in model\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nypred = model.fprop(data.get_test().X)\nypred = np.argmax(ypred, axis=1)\ny = np.argmax(data.get_test().y, axis=1)\naccuracy = np.equal(ypred, y).astype('f4').sum() / len(y)\nprint 'test accuracy:', accuracy\n```\n---\n### More Examples\nMozi can be used to build effectively any kind of architecture. Below is another few examples\n* [**Convolution Neural Network**](doc/cnn.md)\n* [**Denoising Autoencoder**](doc/dae.md)\n* [**Variational Autoencoder**](doc/vae.md)\n* [**Alexnet**](example/voc_alexnet.py)\n\n---\n### Layer Template\nTo build a layer for Mozi, the layer has to implement the template\n```python\nclass Template(object):\n    \"\"\"\n    DESCRIPTION:\n        The interface to be implemented by any layer.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.params = [] # all params that needs to be updated by training go into the list\n\n    def _test_fprop(self, state_below):\n        # the testing track whereby no params update is performed after data flows through this track\n        raise NotImplementedError()\n\n    def _train_fprop(self, state_below):\n        # the training track whereby params is updated every time data flows through this track\n        raise NotImplementedError()\n\n    def _layer_stats(self, state_below, layer_output):\n        # calculate everything you want to know about the layer, the input, the output,\n        # the weight and put in the return list in the format [('W max', T.max(W)), ('W min', T.min(W))].\n        # This method provides a peek into the layer and is useful for debugging.\n        return []\n```\nEach layer provides two tracks: training track and testing track. During training, the model will call `_train_fprop` in every layer and the output from the model will be used to update the params in `self.params` in each layer. During testing, `_test_fprop` is called in every layer and the output is used to evaluate the model and to judge if model should stop training based on the stopping criteria set in the `TrainObject`. We can also peek into each layer by putting whatever we want to know about the layer into `_layer_stats`. For example, if we want to know what is the maximum weight in a layer, we can compute `T.max(W)` and return `[('W max', T.max(W))]` from `_layer_stats`, so that after every epoch, `'W max'` will be calculated for that layer and output to screen.\n\n---\n### Data Interface\nMozi provides two data interface, one is for dataset small enough to fit all into the memory [(SingleBlock)](mozi/datasets/dataset.py#L99), another is for large datasets which cannot be fit into memory in one go and has to be broken up into blocks and load into training one block at a time [(DataBlocks)](mozi/datasets/dataset.py#L185).  \nCheck out the [Mnist](mozi/datasets/mnist.py) or [Cifar10](mozi/datasets/cifar10.py) examples on how to build a dataset.\n\n#### Using SingleBlock Directly\nBesides subclassing `SingleBlock` or `DataBlocks` to create dataset like Mnist and Cifar10 example, we can use `SingleBlock` or `DataBlocks` directly to build a dataset in as simple as\n```python\nfrom mozi.datasets.dataset import SingleBlock\nimport numpy as np\nX = np.random.rand(1000, 5)\ny = np.random.rand(1000, 3)\ndata = SingleBlock(X=X, y=y, batch_size=100, train_valid_test_ratio=[3,1,1])\ntrain_object = TrainObject(dataset = data)\n```\n\n#### For Large Dataset Trained in Blocks\nFor large dataset that cannot fit into memory, you can use `DataBlocks` to train block by block. Below is an example for demonstration. You can also run the [Example](example/datablocks_exp.py)\n```python\nfrom mozi.datasets.dataset import DataBlocks\nimport numpy as np\n\n# we have two blocks of 100 images each saved\n# as ('X1.npy', 'y1.npy') and ('X2.npy', 'y2.npy')\nX1 = np.random.rand(1000, 3, 32, 32)\ny1 = np.random.rand(1000, 10)\nwith open('X1.npy', 'wb') as xin, open('y1.npy', 'wb') as yin:\n    np.save(xin, X1)\n    np.save(yin, y1)\n\nX2 = np.random.rand(1000, 3, 32, 32)\ny2 = np.random.rand(1000, 10)\nwith open('X2.npy', 'wb') as xin, open('y2.npy', 'wb') as yin:\n    np.save(xin, X1)\n    np.save(yin, y1)\n\n# now we can create the data by putting the paths\n# ('X1.npy', 'y1.npy') and ('X2.npy', 'y2.npy') into DataBlocks\n# during training, the TrainObject will load and unload one block at a time\ndata = DataBlocks(data_paths=[('X1.npy', 'y1.npy'), ('X2.npy', 'y2.npy')],\n                  batch_size=100, train_valid_test_ratio=[3,1,1])\ntrain_object = TrainObject(dataset = data)\n```\n\n---\n### Logging\nMozi provides a logging module for automatic saving of best model and logging the errors for each epoch.\n\n\n```python\nfrom mozi.log import Log\n\nlog = Log(experiment_name = 'MLP',\n          description = 'This is a tutorial',\n          save_outputs = True, # log all the outputs from the screen\n          save_model = True, # save the best model\n          save_epoch_error = True, # log error at every epoch\n          save_to_database = {'name': 'Example.db',\n                              'records': {'Batch_Size': data.batch_size,\n                                          'Learning_Rate': learning_method.learning_rate,\n                                          'Momentum': learning_method.momentum}}\n         ) # end log\n```\nThe log module allows logging of outputs from screen, saving best model and epoch-errors. It also allows recording of hyperparameters to the database using the `save_to_database` argument, the `save_to_database` argument takes in a dictionary that contains two fields `'name'` and `'records'`. `'name'` indicates the name of the database to save the recording table. The name of the recording table will follow the experiment name under argument `experiment_name`. The `'records'` field takes in a dictionary of unrestricted number of hyperparameters that we want to record. The `'records'` only accepts primitive data types (str, int, float).\nOnce log object is built, it can be passed into `TrainObject` as\n```python\nTrainObject(log = log)\n```\n<!--### More Features-->\n<!--##### Data Iterators-->\n<!--##### Customized Learning Method-->\n<!--##### Customized Weight Initialization-->\n---\n### Load Saved Model\nWhen we set `save_model` in `Log` to be true, the best model is automatically saved to `MOZI_SAVE_PATH`. The model is serialized in pickle format, so to load the saved model. We can use cPickle.\n```python\nimport cPickle\nwith open('model.pkl', 'rb') as fout:\n    model = cPickle.load(fout)\n    y = model.fprop(X)\n```\n---\n\n### Why Mozi?\n[Mozi](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mozi) (\u58a8\u5b50) (470 B.C - 391 B.C) is a Chinese philosopher during warring states period (\u6625\u79cb\u6230\u570b), his philosophy advocates peace, simplicity, universal love and pragmatism.\n\n---\n### Licence\nMIT Licence", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "UNKNOWN", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/hycis/Mozi", "keywords": null, "license": "The MIT License (MIT), see LICENCE", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "mozi", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/mozi/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/mozi/", "project_urls": {"Download": "UNKNOWN", "Homepage": "https://github.com/hycis/Mozi"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/mozi/2.0.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Deep learning package based on theano for building all kinds of models", "version": "2.0.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            Mozi<br>=====<br><br>Mozi is based on Theano with a clean and sharp design, the **design philosophy** of Mozi<br><br>1. **Fast and Simple**: The main engine of the package is only 200 lines of code.

The model is serialized in pickle format, so to load the saved model. We can use cPickle.<br>```python<br>import cPickle<br>with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as fout:<br>    model = cPickle.load(fout)<br>    y = model.fprop(X)<br>```<br>---<br><br>### Why Mozi?<br>[Mozi](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mozi) (\u58a8\u5b50) (470 B.C - 391 B.C) is a Chinese philosopher during warring states period (\u6625\u79cb\u6230\u570b), his philosophy advocates peace, simplicity, universal love and pragmatism.<br><br>---<br>### Licence<br>MIT Licence\n          </div>"}, "last_serial": 2370329, "releases": {"2.0.3": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "21e4bb91b87e1d5147a94c5ba49fa767", "sha256": "cf79a8aa0bf2ed3010816e1a05744b18726b71e9dc6c9530d2969528b2b5ef63"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "mozi-2.0.3.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "21e4bb91b87e1d5147a94c5ba49fa767", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 43589, "upload_time": "2016-09-29T06:13:47", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2016-09-29T06:13:47.816977Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e4/90/776f9e43effa7eb185575454ea1e9b82b0664ba52b0ee7bfd9b264869d81/mozi-2.0.3.tar.gz", "yanked": false}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "21e4bb91b87e1d5147a94c5ba49fa767", "sha256": "cf79a8aa0bf2ed3010816e1a05744b18726b71e9dc6c9530d2969528b2b5ef63"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "mozi-2.0.3.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "21e4bb91b87e1d5147a94c5ba49fa767", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 43589, "upload_time": "2016-09-29T06:13:47", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2016-09-29T06:13:47.816977Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e4/90/776f9e43effa7eb185575454ea1e9b82b0664ba52b0ee7bfd9b264869d81/mozi-2.0.3.tar.gz", "yanked": false}], "timestamp": "Fri May  8 00:51:25 2020"}

If you aren't authorized -- in python terms, if remote_user is\nnot set on the request -- then CAPTCHAs and a hidden key will be added\nto forms with ``method=POST``.  You will be required to correctly\nsolve the CAPTCHA in order to submit the POST request.  Otherwise, the\nCAPTCHAmiddleware will stop your request and redirect you back to\nthe form.\n\n\nWhat are CAPTCHAs?  -or- I hate those things\n--------------------------------------------\n\nCAPTCHAs are admittedly imperfect ways of telling humans and computers\napart.  Presumedly if you are already identified (logged in), then the\ncomputer is satisfied that you are you.  But what if you want to make\nan anonymous comment on someone's blog post?  In a perfect world,\nthere would be no CAPTCHAs.  In the real world, there is SPAM.  So if\nI want to protect my blog from SPAM-bots, I need to do something.\nAgain, CAPTCHAs aren't perfect, but they're at least something.\n\n\nWhy SkimpyGimpy?\n----------------\n\nI used SkimpyGimpy because it is free, open souce, and has an easy to\nuse API.  People complain that the CAPTCHAs are hard to read.  I'm\nsorry about that.  If you really want to help, I'm sure the\nSkimpyGimpy developers would be more than glad for a hand.\n\n\nWhy not reCAPTCHA?\n------------------\n\nreCAPTCHA is annoying because it uses an API key and is not open\nsource.  I have no idea why either of those things are true.  If\nsomeone wanted to help include reCAPTCHA support in this package, I'd be happy\nto help.  But because my opposition to closed source software (yes,\neven if they are web services) and API keys, its not a priority for\nme.\n\n\nWhy do this with middleware instead of in an app?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a long debate and the subject of many blog posts.  In short, both\napproaches are valid.  If you want to integrated with application\nlogic, you shouldn't use middleware for something like this.  If you\njust want this functionality and don't care about tight integration,\nthen this approach might work for you.\n\n\nWhy does CAPTCHAmiddleware look half done?\n----------------------------------------------\n\nBecause it is.  This is very much a work in progress.  Its target\naudience is clearly developers who want to get their hands dirty.

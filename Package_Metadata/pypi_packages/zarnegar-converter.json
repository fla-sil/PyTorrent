The first version of Zarnegar (for DOS), was released in\nApril-May 1991, and Windows versions have been available since 2000.\n\nZarnegar has employed two different character sets and file formats.\n\n-----------------------\nZarnegar1 Character Set\n-----------------------\n\nZarnegar used an `Iran System`_-based character encoding system, named\n*Zarnegar1*, with text file formats for its early versions, up to its \"Zarnegar\n75\" version.  *Zarnegar1* character set is a *2-form left-to-right visual\nencoding*, meaning the every `Perso-Arabic`_ letter receives different\ncharacter codes based on its cursive joining form, but most letters receive\nonly 2 forms, because of the limited code-points available2 forms, because of\nthe limited code-points available.\n\nThis project has a partial implementation of `Zarnegar1`_ encoding\n(`zarnegar_converter/zar1_encoding.py`) and a full implementation of its binary\nand text file formats (`zarnegar_converter/zar1_file.py`).\n\n------------------------\nZarnegar75 Character Set\n------------------------\n\nWith \"Zarnegar 75\" version of the program, a new character encoding system was\nintroduced, and the file format was changed to another binary format.\n*Zarnegar75* character set is a 4-form bidirectional encoding, meaning that\nevery `Perso-Arabic`_ letter receives one, two, or four character code,\ndepending on its cursive joining form, and these letters are stored in the\nmemory in the semantic order.\n\nSupport for *Zarnegar75* file format and encoding is still in progress.\n\n----------\nHow to Use\n----------\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n  $ ./src/zarnegar-converter.py unicode_legacy_lro samples/zar1-sample-text-01.zar\n  \u202d                                                          \ufee1\ufe8e\ufbfe\ufea7 \ufe95\ufe8e\ufbfe\ufecb\ufe8e\ufe91\ufead \uf8fd\ufee9\ufead\ufe8e\ufe91\ufead\ufea9 |\n  \u202d                                                            \ufbfd\ufee7\ufb58\ufe8d\ufb8a \ufead\ufecc\ufeb7 \ufead\ufea9 \ufeed\ufb90\ufbfe\ufe8e\ufeeb |\n\n-----------------\nHow to Contribute\n-----------------\n\nPlease report any issues at\n<https://github.com/behnam/python-zarnegar-converter/issues> or submit GitHub\npull requests.\n\nThe encoding mappings (both Zarnegar1 and Zarnegar75) can be improved with\naccess to more sample files.

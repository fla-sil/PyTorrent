For example:\n* Old: `from driver import apa102`\n* New: `from apa102_pi.driver import apa102`\n\n## Introduction\nApa102-pi is a pure Python library to drive APA102 type LED strands. It is supposed to work on a Raspberry Pi,\nand is not tested on any other platform.\n\nAPA102 LEDs are typically 5050 type LEDs with an additional driver chip per LED.\nThe driver chip takes care of receiving the desired colour via its input lines, and then holding\nthis colour until a new command is received.\n\nDepending on where these LEDs are bought, they might be called \"APA102\", \"Superled\", or \"DotStar\".\nThey should not be confused with the three-wire WS2812 LEDs, also known as \"NeoPixel\".\n\nThe really nice part about the driver chip is this: Once it has received its own colour command,\nit forwards any further colour commands from its input to its output lines.\nThis allows to easily chain multiple LEDs together. Colour command #1 lights the first LED,\ncommand #2 the next LED, and so forth. Sending for example 300 colour commands does light\nan entire 5 Meter, 60 LEDs per Meter strip.\n\nSome APA102 pictures are available [here](https://www.iot-projekte.ch/apa102-led-part-1-pictures)\n\n## Purpose\nThe library is designed to take care of the details about sending colour commands.\nIt is supposed to be educational, and is therefore written in Python.\nThe library is fast enough to produce nice colour effects on a 300 LED strand, even though it is running\nvia the Python interpreter. However, if you need something really fast, e.g. to drive a\nsmall \"display\" based on APA102 LEDs with 15 frames per second, then you have to look elsewhere.\n\n## Prerequisites\n* A Raspberry Pi, running an up-to-date version of Raspbian (the library is tested with the 2019-09-26\nversion of Raspbian Buster Lite).\n* If hardware SPI is used: SPI enabled and active (`raspi-config`, Interfacing Options, SPI, \\<Yes\\>);\nThe SPI must be free and unused.\n* For software SPI (bit bang mode): Two free GPIO pins\n* The Adafruit_Python_GPIO library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO).\nThe library will be installed automatically if you follow the instructions below.  \n* Python 3: Some people tried with Python 2 and reported it working, but I can't vouch for this myself.\nI used Python 3 for all development and test. \n\nFor a permanent installation, a 10$ Raspberry Pi Zero W can be dedicated to the task of driving the LEDs.\nThe connector to the LED stripe would be soldered directly to the correct ports on the board.\nFor development purposes, a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is a better choice due to its greater speed.\nEven the 1GB model is more than enough.\n\n## Wiring\nThe Raspberry Pi is a 3.3 Volt device, and the APA102 LEDs are 5 Volt devices. \nTherefore it's possible that the 3.3 Volt SPI signal is not properly recognized by the LED driver chips.\nTo avoid this risk, use a 74AHCT125 or 74AHC125 level shifter for both the clock and the MOSI signal.\nYou will not damage the Raspberry Pi without a level shifter, because the Raspberry Pi determines\nthe voltage of MOSI and SCLK.  \nIn my limited testing with four different stripes from various Chinese sources I had no issues without\na level shifter, but your experience might be different.\n\nWithout a level shifter, the wiring is very simple:\n\n- LED ground to one of the Raspberry ground pins  \n- LED Data to Raspberry SPI MOSI  \n- LED Clock to Raspberry SPI SCLK\n\nNote that the \"Chip Select\" line (CE0 or CE1) is not used on an APA102 strip.\nThe APA102 chip always accepts data, and cannot be switched off.\nFor \"Chip Select\" to work, you need additional hardware. If you use a level shifter,\nyou can wire CE0 or CE1 to its \"output-enable\" pin, for example.\n\nThe LED strip uses a lot of power (roughly 20mA per LED, i.e. 60mA for one bright white dot).\nIf you try to power the LEDs from the Raspberry Pi 5V output, you will most likely immediately\nkill the Raspberry! Therefore I recommend not to connect the power line of the LED with the Raspberry. \nTo be on the safe side, use a separate USB power supply for the Raspberry, and a strong 5V supply \nfor the LEDs. If you use a level shifter, power it from the 5V power supply as well.\n\nHaving said this, you *can* power the Raspberry from the same power supply as the LED stripes\n(instead of using an extra USB power supply). If you decide to do this, make sure to never plug\na USB power supply to the Raspberry Pi, or you risk that the LEDs try to take power through the Raspberry.\n\nAll combined, this is my extremely low-tech wiring diagram:\n\n![Wiring Diagram](Wiring.jpg)\n\nAnd here it is, the finished contraption running a \"rainbow\" program:\n\n![Raspberry Pi Zero driving APA102 LEDs](Finished.jpg)\n\nThis is a Raspberry Pi Zero W with a Phat Beat amplifier on top. The amplifier's \"VU meter\" is simply\na bunch of APA 102 LEDs; They show the \"Rainbow\" color scheme:\n\n![Raspberry Pi Zero W with Phat Beat](PhatBeat.jpg)\n\nPlugged into the USB port is a WLAN stick (nowadays I use a Raspberry Pi Zero W, of course).\nThis way I can reprogram the light show from my desk, even if the strips are installed outside \nas a Christmas light. Compare this to an Arduino/WS2812 based installation: To reprogram one has\nto take the Arduino inside, or a laptop outside.\n\n## Quick Raspberry Pi setup\nBecause the Raspberry Pi Zero runs headless, the Raspbian Lite image was used.\nThis image only contains the bare minimum of packages, and some packages have be added manually.\n\nThe current Raspbian Lite images can easily be set-up to run headless from the start.\nAfter burning the card on a Mac or PC, it will be mounted as \"boot\". Go to this directory,\nand create an empty file named `ssh` to enable SSH.  \nOn a Mac you would do this: `touch /Volumes/boot/ssh`. To enable and configure WLAN, create\na file named `wpa_supplicant.conf`. Its content should be:  \n\n\tcountry=CH\n\tctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev\n\tupdate_config=1\n\n\tnetwork={\n\t\tssid=\"Your_SSID\"\n\t\tpsk=\"Your_Password\"\n\t\tkey_mgmt=WPA-PSK\n\t}\n\nOf course, use the correct country and ssid/psk. After booting (be patient: The Pi will initially boot twice)\nyou can SSH into the Raspberry Pi: `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`. The initial password\nis `raspberry`: Make sure to change it right away!\n\nNext, install additional packages and enable SPI:\n\n- Update your installation (`sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade`).\n- Install packages: `sudo apt install -y python3-pip`\n- Activate SPI: `sudo raspi-config`; Go to \"Interfacing Options\"; Go to \"SPI\"; Enable SPI;\nWhile you are at it: Do change the default password! Exit exit the tool and reboot  \n\n## Use the APA102 project as a library\nThe library was originally built as an educational piece of software. It shows how the protocol\nfor APA102 LEDs works. Most of this is explained in the form of comments in the source code.\nIf you are interested in this, then follow up with the next chapter.\nIf all you need is the library itself for your own projects, then this chapter is enough to get you started.\n\nInstall the library like this: `sudo pip3 install apa102-pi`. \nThis will install the library and it's dependencies for all users. \n\nTo verify the installation, download the test script from Github:\n`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinue/apa102-pi/master/runcolorcycle.py -o runcolorcycle.py`.\nTo run, type `python3 ./runcolorcycle.py`.\n\n## Full installation\nTo retrieve the full library including source code, this is what you need to do *additionally*:\n- Install the git client: `sudo apt install -y git`  \n- Prepare GIT: `git config --global user.name \"John Doe\" && git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com`  \n- Create a development directory and change into it: `mkdir ~/Development && cd ~/Development`  \n- Get the APA102 Library and sample light programs: `git clone https://github.com/tinue/apa102-pi.git && cd apa102-pi`  \n- You might want to set the number of LEDs to match your strip: `nano runcolorcycle.py`; Update the number, Ctrl-X and \"Yes\" to save.  \n- Run the sample lightshow: `./runcolorcycle.py`.\n- Optional: Remove the previously installed central version of the library (but keep the necessary dependencies): `sudo pip3 uninstall apa102-pi`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n### Flicker\nSome users reported flicker towards the end of large stripes. It seems that there is a correlation amongst\nthree variables:\n* SPI bus speed\n* Overall brightness of the strip\n* Length of the strip\n\nIt turns out that you can only have two out of three: On a long, bright strip you will have to lower the bus speed significantly.\nCheck the apa102.py driver: Default is 8MHz (`BUS_SPEED_HZ = 8000000`). You may have to go as low as 1.5MHz, \ni.e. `BUS_SPEED_HZ = 1500000`. This means that all light programs with lots of updates and zero wait\n(e.g. rainbow) will run much slower.\n\n## Release history\n- 1.0.0 (2015-04-13): Initial version\n- 1.1.0 (2015-12-04): Add documentation\n- 1.1.1 (2015-12-11): Rewrote the examples, driver itself is unchanged\n- 1.2.0 (2015-12-17): Fixes for reported problems; Update all of the color samples; Decouple number of steps from number of LEDs\n- 1.3.0 (2016-03-25): Merged changes from kapacuk: Allow stripes with different color coding than RGB\n- 1.3.1 (2016-03-27): Merged 'rotate' method from kapacuk; Fixed errors from previous merge\n- 1.3.2 (2016-12-25): Fixed error related to 'rotate'; Removed annoying messages on console; Added a debug method\n- 1.3.3 (2017-04-14): Merged pull request #19 from DurandA/master; Cleanup; Update README.MD, No functional changes\n- 1.4.0 (2017-04-16): Update code to better comply with the Python style guide (PEP 8); Merged pull request from 'jmb'\n- 1.4.1 (2017-08-26): Tested with Raspbian Stretch; Update Readme.\n- 2.0.0 (2017-11-05): Exchanged the SPI library to Adafruit_Python_GPIO.

Ideally you should know  approximate parameters about your system, namely:\n\n* What arc lamp was used (e.g. Xe, Hg, Ar, CuNeAr)\n* What the dispersion of your spectrometer is (i.e. angstroms/pixel)\n* The spectral range of your system, and the starting wavelength\n\nYou don't need to know the dispersion and start wavelength exactly.

Blind calibration, where no parameters are known, is possible but challenging currently. If you don't know the lamp, you can try iterating over the various combinations of sources.

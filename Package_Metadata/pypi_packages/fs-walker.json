Run:\n    ```\n    git clone https://github.com/hoduche/fs-walker\n    ```\n2. Inside the newly created fs-walker folder, run (with Python 3 and setuptools):\n    ```\n    python setup.py install\n    ```\n\n## Run\n\n#### As a command\nUpon installation, Fs-walker adds two commands to the command line: `duplicate` and `missing`.\n\nRunning `duplicate` will:\n1. List all duplicated files and directories in a root directory passed as the --path (or -p) argument\n2. Save the duplicate listing as a duplicate_listing.json file in the root directory\n3. Print the potential space gain in Gigabytes\n\nIt can also dump the full listing.json and tree.json files in the root directory with the --dump-listing (or -d) argument.\nAnd if a listing.json file is passed as the --path (or -p) argument instead of a root directory, the listing is deserialized from the json file instead of being generated.\n\nExample:\n```\nduplicate -p E:/AllPictures -d\n```\n\nRunning `missing` will:\n1. List all files and directories that are present in an old root directory passed as the --old-path (or -o) argument and that are missing in a new one passed as the --new-path (or -n) argument\n2. Save the missing listing as a missing_listing.json file in the new root directory\n\nIt can also dump the full listing.json and tree.json files in the two root directories with the --dump-listing (or -d) argument.\nAnd if a listing.json file is passed as the --old-path (or -o) argument or as the --new-path (or -n) argument, instead of a root directory, the corresponding listing is deserialized from the json file instead of being generated.\n\nExample:\n```\nmissing -o D:/Pictures -n E:/AllPictures -d\n```\n\n#### As a Python module\n\n```python\nimport pathlib\n\nimport fs_walker.walker as fsw\n\nfolder_path = pathlib.Path('D:/Pictures')\nlisting, tree = fsw.walk(folder_path)\n```", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url":

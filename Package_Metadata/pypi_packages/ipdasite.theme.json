And\r\nnow, we're powered by Diazo.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0.1 \u2014 Workaround TinyMCE\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nThis release works around some of the problems with TinyMCE.  Notably, the\r\nIPDA theme includes a background image on the html element so it can fill the\r\nentire page regardless of scrolling.  However, the inner html in the TinyMCE\r\niframe picks that up as well, leaving an ugly navy blue block in your text\r\nediting area.  Secondly, Products.TinyMCE includes a link \"Edit without visual\r\neditor\" that's contained in a div with a hard-coded style block set to a -1em\r\nmargin.  That makes the link land badly in our theme.  Sadly, there's no CSS\r\nclasses or IDs we can use on that link (or its div) so we sneak some invisible\r\ncontent just above it to space it out.  (Ugly yes, but that should be fixed in\r\nProducts.TinyMCE.)\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0.0 \u2014 Plone 4\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThis release of the IPDA Site Policy brings about Plone 4 compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright & License\r\n===================\r\n\r\nCopyright 2008\u20132012 by the California Institute of Technology.

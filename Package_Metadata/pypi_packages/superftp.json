Clone the git repository\n2. run the `build.sh` script in the root of the project, the build.sh script will do the following\n    * clean the project\n    * run pycodestyle on the project to check that best practice coding standards are followed\n    * run pylint on the project to check that best practice coding standards are followed\n    * run the unit tests for the project\n    * generate documentation for the project (the generated documentation is available at `docs/_build/html/index.html`)\n    * package the project into a redistributable, the redistributable is available in the `dist` directory in the root of the project\n\n\n\n### Release Notes ###\nv1.0.3\n* First official release", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/Snackman8/superftp", "keywords": "", "license": "License :: OSI Approved :: Apache Software License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "superftp", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/superftp/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/superftp/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/Snackman8/superftp"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/superftp/1.0.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=2.7", "summary": "Multisegment FTP Client", "version": "1.0.3", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            <h1>superftp</h1>\n<p>Fast multi-segment FTP client</p>\n<p>This FTP client maximizes download speed for large files over\nlong geographic distances.

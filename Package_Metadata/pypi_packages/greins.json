It aims to simplify\nthe process of setting up any number of system-wide Gunicorn_ daemons.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nGreins requires a working version of Gunicorn_. It is recommended to read and\nunderstand the Gunicorn_ installation instructions before using Greins.\n\nInstall from sources::\n\n  $ python setup.py install\n\nInstall as an rpm::\n\n  $ make rpm\n\nWhatever was here before was wrong. There is no place in PyPI for Greins.\nThe most useful aspects of Greins are in the packaging, since it aims to\nfacilitate deployment of Gunicorn and adds no particular functionality itself.\n\nThere's an init script in etc/init aims to be LSB-compliant and packaging\nfor other distributions and systems is an ongoing effort.\n\nThose wishing to deploy Greins for their own infrastructure are encouraged\nto contribute to the development.\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\nGreins installs one command line script invoked as ``greins``.\n\ngreins\n+++++++++\n\nOptions are the same as for Gunicorn_ with one exception: the single\nAPP_MODULE argument is replaced by APP_DIR, a directory containing python\nsource files as described in the following section.\n\nApplication Configuration\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nApplications should be configured by placing a python source file in the\nconfiguration directory. This file should populate a dictionary in the global\nscope called ``mounts`` which maps address prefixes (or 'mount points') to\nWSGI handler functions.\n\nThese files are evaluated just like a Gunicorn_ `config file`_. Server hooks\nare valid in these configuration files and work as in Gunicorn_. Other options,\nsuch as logging and worker configuration, are ignored and should be configured\nglobally for the Greins application.\n\nAs a convenience, a file name ``myapp`` which does not define any ``mounts``\nwill try to import ``myapp:application`` and mount it underneath the path\n``/myapp``.\n\nIt should be possible to write an application for Gunicorn_ and then place\na Gunicorn_ configuration file inside the configuration directory for Greins\nto begin using it within Greins immediately, provided that the config file name\nmatches a module in the python path which exports ``application`` as a WSGI_\ncallable.\n\nExamples\n++++++++\n\nThe examples directory runs a single ``greins`` application from the file\n``test.py`` which demonstrates loading several routes as well as using the\n``gunicorn`` server hooks. To run the examples, launch ``greins`` from the\ndirectory above ``examples`` with:\n\n  $ greins examples\n\nThe ``greins`` command accepts ``gunicorn`` options. For example:\n\n  $ greins -kgevent -b0.0.0.0:8080 examples\n\nLICENSE\n-------\n\nGreins is released under the MIT License.

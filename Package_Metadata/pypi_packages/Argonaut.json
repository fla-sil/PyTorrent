Description\n==============\n\nArgonaut is a blogging engine built with Pylons. It is lightweight\nand can be deployed on many types of web servers running Python.\n\nThe application is still very much in alpha stages and as such \nthere are bugs in the system and a lot of features which have \nnot been implemented.\n\nFor more information please see the following links:\n    Authors webpage\n       http://www.basshero.org\n    Pylons HQ\n       http://www.pylonshq.com\n\n\n2. Licence\n==========\n\nArgonaut is distributed under the FreeBSD license. This means you can use,\ncopy and distribute the code and application for free and with no obligations.\nIt is however required that the included copyright is included with the application\nusing source or binary components. Please see the file LICENSE.txt for the full\nlicense.\n\nThe licenses of the JavaScript components included with Argonaut do not\nenforce any additional requirements for reuse or distribution. Please see the\nlicenses of these components and any included icons in the folder 'third_party_licenses'.\n\n\n3. Installation\n===============\n\n3.1 Prequisites for install\n---------------------------\n\n- Python 2.4 - 2.7 [http://www.python.org]\n- Pylons 1.0 [http://pylonshq.com/]\n- Python setuptools (easy_install) [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools]\n\nPlease see Pylons documentation to get started with Pylons [http://pylonshq.com/docs/en/0.9.7/gettingstarted/].\n\n\n3.2 Other components\n--------------------\n\nIn addition to Pylons, Argonaut uses the following components:\n\n- Mako (templates, the View) [http://www.makotemplates.org/]\n- SQLAlchemy (the Model) [http://www.sqlalchemy.org/]\n- Sqlalchemy-migrate (database migration) [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sqlalchemy-migrate]\n- repoze.what (authentication and access rights) [http://what.repoze.org/docs/1.0/]\n- CKEditor (for writing posts) [http://ckeditor.com/]\n- AddToAny (for sharing) [http://www.addtoany.com/]\n- jQuery (for additional magic) [http://jquery.com/]\n- Simple3color (default theme) [http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/3533]\n- TurboMail (for notifications) [http://www.python-turbomail.org/]\n- pwi (Picasa Webalbum Integrator javascript library, for gallery) [http://code.google.com/p/pwi/]\n\nOf these the JavaScript components CKEditor, jQuery, pwi and AddToAny are\ndistributed along with this package. The Python components are downloaded\nand installed by easy_install.\n\n\n3.3 Installation and Setup\n--------------------------\n\nPrequisites for install must be fulfilled. Install Argonaut using easy_install:\n\n    easy_install argonaut\n    \n       OR with local .egg file\n       \n    easy_install <path_to_egg_file>\n\nMake a config file as follows:\n\n    paster make-config argonaut config.ini\n\nTweak the config file as appropriate. Please see Pylons application\nsetup pages for hints on editing the config file [http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/].\nAfter this run the following to setup the application:\n\n    paster setup-app config.ini#arg\n\nThen you are ready to go.\n\nYou can test the installation by running:\n\n    paster serve config.ini\n\nAfter this visit the link http://127.0.0.1:5000\n\nOptionally you can extract the source and run Argonaut by launching development\nmode via setup.py. Just extract the source, install Pylons and in the Argonaut\nbase directory run:\n    \n    python setup.py develop\n    paster serve development.ini\n\n\n4. Updating from a previous version\n===================================\n\nAn automatic database schema update routine has been implemented since 0.3 version.\nUnfortunately this does not handle all database related changes. Please see changelog below\nfor notes on what needs to be done with version upgrades.\n\n\n5. Usage\n========\n\n5.1 Modifying the site\n----------------------\n\nArgonaut features templates that can be used to control the site\nstructure, layout and texts. Unfortunately in this early version\nthere is no admin panel so all editing must be made to the files\ndirectly.\n\nTemplate files are situated in argonaut/templates. Please see\nMako documentation on how to change the templates.\n\n\n5.2 Configuration\n-----------------\n\nDuring application setup a database will be created in the form\nthat is configured in config.ini. In addition to blog data, Argonaut\nalso stores some configuration values in the database. These are \nstored in the table 'config'.\n\n\n5.3 Users\n---------\n\nThe default user for writing posts is 'admin', password 'admin'.\nCurrently users can only be added directly to the database. An\nadmin panel will be added later.\n\n\n5.4 Other usage notes\n---------------------\n\nProper documentation and usage will be added slowly over\nfuture releases :)\n\n\n6. Support\n==========\n\nPlease contact the author at jaywink (at) basshero.org for support,\nideas and bug reports.\n\n\n7. Changelog\n============\n\n0.3.4 30th March 2011\n    - Added custom javascript template that is loaded from base template for site wide usage.\n    - Removed usage of sqlalchemy-migrate since it was causing problems. A new type of DB migration\n      will be thought out later.\n\n0.3.3 29th March 2011\n    - Fixed routing for landing page with lowest page_order\n    - Post commenting can now be disabled with the config setting comments_enabled, true/false\n    - Fixed character encoding problem when getting page name from database\n    - Base page now only displays links to active pages\n    - Added a new page type, pwi_gallery, which is a gallery page using the jquery plugin 'pwi'\n      (Picasa Webalbum Integrator javascript library, http://code.google.com/p/pwi/).\n    \n0.3.2 20th February 2011\n    - Added 'media' and 'social' models to the database. Media contains links to \n      images and other media items. Social contains links to contact information or\n      other sites. Links are given a media ID which is displayed in the Social -box with\n      an url to the site or contact information.\n\n0.3 13th February 2011\n    - sqlalchemy-migrate is now used to do automatic database schema\n      upgrades according to model changes. Added as dependency, installed\n      via easy_install automatically. Implementation thanks to:\n      http://shane.caraveo.com/2010/09/13/database-migrations-for-sqlalchemy-part-duex/\n    - Default landing page is now the one with the lowest page_order setting.\n    - Pages are now mapped to a page type. Default page types are 'blog', 'archives' and\n      'tags'.\n    - Page urls are now determined from page type, but can also be customised.\n    - Custom page support has been added. Custom pages are mapped to page type 'custom'\n      which redirects traffic to a mako template file as indicated in the pages table.\n    - Version number will now be displayed in the Powered by -section in the main template.\n      Removed these text strings and urls from the configuration table and placed them in\n      the base template.\n    Updating from version 0.2:\n    - Pre-upgrade the database table 'pages' needs to be dropped for an easy upgrade. After\n      this the script 'paster setup-app [config_file]#arg' needs to be run to create the\n      table with the new schema. The rest of the database changes should be handled by\n      the automatic schema update mechanism.\n\n0.2 6th December 2010\n    - Initial Pylons version release\n\n0.1.x   The 0.1 versions are the old PHP powered versions which were never released.", "description_content_type": null, "docs_url": null, "download_url": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Argonaut", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "http://www.basshero.org", "keywords": "python pylons blogging cms blog", "license": "FreeBSD", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "name": "Argonaut", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Argonaut/", "platform": "UNKNOWN", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Argonaut/", "project_urls": {"Download": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Argonaut", "Homepage": "http://www.basshero.org"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/Argonaut/0.3.4/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": null, "summary": "Lightweight Pylons powered blogging engine.", "version": "0.3.4", "yanked": false, "html_description": "<div class=\"project-description\">\n            ARGONAUT   <br>========<br><br>Version 0.3.4 (30th March 2011)<br><br>Author: Jason Robinson<br>jaywink (at) basshero.org<br>http://www.basshero.org<br><br><br>1.
